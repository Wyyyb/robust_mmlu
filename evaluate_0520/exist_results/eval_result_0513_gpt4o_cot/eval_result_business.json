These guidelines generally aim to ensure that advertisements are ethical and do not cause harm or offense. Let's break down the options:\n\n1. **Encourage Unsafe Practices**: Regulatory bodies typically discourage any promotion of unsafe practices to protect consumers.\n2. **Cause Unnecessary Distress or Fear**: Advertisements should not cause unnecessary emotional distress or fear.\n3. **Cause Serious Offense**: Advertisements should avoid causing serious offense to the audience.\n\nGiven these points, the correct option should reflect these principles. Let's review the options:\n\nA. Safe practices, Fear, Jealousy, Trivial\n- This option is incorrect because it suggests encouraging safe practices, which is not typically a concern for regulatory bodies.\n\nB. Unsafe practices, Distress, Joy, Trivial\n- This option is incorrect because it includes \"Joy\" and \"Trivial,\" which are not typically concerns for regulatory bodies.\n\nC.

The term \"sizing\" here likely refers to either increasing (up-sizing) or decreasing (down-sizing) the number of employees.\n\n2. **First Blank**: The two main issues are associated with either \"up-sizing\" or \"down-sizing\". Given the context of redundancy and layoffs, \"down-sizing\" is the more appropriate term.\n\n3. **Second Blank**: The first issue mentioned is related to the information policy of the corporation and the employees' right to know if they are being made redundant. This suggests the issue is about \"involvement\" or \"privacy\". \"Involvement\" seems more fitting as it implies employees should be involved or informed about such decisions.\n\n4. **Third Blank**: The second issue is about what employees receive when they are laid off. This is typically referred to as \"remuneration\" or \"compensation\".\n\n5. **Fourth Blank**: The specific type of package employees receive when laid off is usually called a \"severance\" package or \"compensation\" package. \"Compensation\" is a broader term, but \"severance\" is more specific to layoffs.\n\nCombining these insights, the most fitting option is:\n- **Down-sizing** (reducing the number of employees)\n- **Involvement** (employees' right to know)\n- **Remuneration** (what employees receive)\n- **Compensation** (the package they receive)\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\nThe answer is (J)."

Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Ethical egoism: This theory suggests that individuals should act in their own self-interest. It does not emphasize an emotional moral impulse towards others.\n\nB. Ethics of duty: This is associated with deontological ethics, which focuses on adherence to rules or duties. It is more rational and rule-based rather than emotional.\n\nC. Postmodern ethics: This approach often critiques traditional ethical theories and can emphasize the role of emotions and context, but it is not specifically defined by an emotional moral impulse towards others.\n\nD. Consequentialist ethics: This theory, including utilitarianism, focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions. It is more rational and outcome-based.\n\nE. Utilitarian ethics: A form of consequentialism that seeks the greatest good for the greatest number. It is rational and outcome-focused.\n\nF. Deontological ethics: Focuses on rules and duties, emphasizing rationality over emotions.\n\nG. Virtue ethics: Focuses on the character and virtues of the individual, which can include emotions but is not specifically defined by an emotional moral impulse towards others.\n\nH. Ethics of care: This ethical framework emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and emotional responses. It locates morality in an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others.\n\nI.

The declining-balance method is an accelerated depreciation method that applies a constant rate of depreciation to the declining book value of the asset each year.\n\n1. **Determine the depreciation rate**: \n   - Since the carpeting is made to last for five years, the straight-line depreciation rate would be 1/5 or 20%. \n   - The declining-balance method typically uses double the straight-line rate, so the rate would be 40%.\n\n2. **Calculate the first year's depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation for the first year = 40% of $3,000 = 0.40 * $3,000 = $1,200.\n   - Book value at the end of the first year = $3,000 - $1,200 = $1,800.\n\n3. **Calculate the second year's depreciation**:\n   - Depreciation for the second year = 40% of $1,800 = 0.40 * $1,800 = $720.\n\nTherefore, the depreciation for the second year is $720.\n\nThe answer is (H)."

Average Cost Method:\n- Calculate the total cost of all purchases and beginning inventory.\n- Calculate the total quantity of all purchases and beginning inventory.\n- Divide the total cost by the total quantity to get the average cost per unit.\n- Multiply the average cost per unit by the ending inventory quantity.\n\n**Total Cost Calculation:**\n- Beginning Inventory: 27,000 units at $6.00 = $162,000\n- March 12 Purchase: 50,000 units at $6.50 = $325,000\n- September 11 Purchase: 35,000 units at $7.00 = $245,000\n- December 3 Purchase: 40,000 units at $7.50 = $300,000\n\n**Total Quantity Calculation:**\n- Total Quantity = 27,000 + 50,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 = 152,000 units\n\n**Total Cost Calculation:**\n- Total Cost = $162,000 + $325,000 + $245,000 + $300,000 = $1,032,000\n\n**Average Cost per Unit:**\n- Average Cost per Unit = Total Cost / Total Quantity = $1,032,000 / 152,000 = $6.7895 (approx.)\n\n**Ending Inventory Value:**\n- Ending Inventory Value = Average Cost per Unit * Ending Inventory Quantity = $6.7895 * 44,000 = $298,738 (approx.)\n\n#### 2. FIFO Method:\n- Use the cost of the oldest inventory first.\n- Calculate the cost of the ending inventory using the most recent purchases.\n\n**Ending Inventory Calculation:**\n- 44,000 units from the most recent purchases:\n  - December 3 Purchase: 40,000 units at $7.50 = $300,000\n  - September 11 Purchase: 4,000 units at $7.00 = $28,000\n\n**Total FIFO Inventory Value:**\n- Total FIFO Inventory Value = $300,000 + $28,000 = $328,000\n\n#### 3. LIFO Method:\n- Use the cost of the most recent inventory first.\n- Calculate the cost of the ending inventory using the oldest purchases.\n\n**Ending Inventory Calculation:**\n- 44,000 units from the oldest purchases:\n  - January 1 (Beginning Inventory): 27,000 units at $6.00 = $162,000\n  - March 12 Purchase: 17,000 units at $6.50 = $110,500\n\n**Total LIFO Inventory Value:**\n- Total LIFO Inventory Value = $162,000 + $110,500 = $272,500\n\n### Final Answer:\n- Average Cost: $298,738 (approx.)\n- FIFO: $328,000\n- LIFO: $272,500\n\nThe closest match to these values in the options provided is:\n**The answer is (G).**"

Social accounting focuses on issues beyond just financial performance, targets a broader audience than just shareholders, and is voluntary in nature. \n\n1. **Focus on issues**: Social accounting deals with social, environmental, and ethical issues.\n2. **Intended audience**: The audience extends beyond shareholders to include other stakeholders such as employees, customers, and the community.\n3. **Voluntary nature**: Unlike mandatory financial reporting, social accounting is often voluntary.\n\nGiven these points, we need to find the option that correctly contrasts social accounting with another form of accounting or reporting that does not share these characteristics.\n\n- **Option A**: Social accounting vs. Environmental management initiatives. This is incorrect because both can be voluntary and focus on broader issues.\n- **Option B**: Financial accounting vs. Environmental management initiatives.

This high involvement is due to the high perceived risk, leading consumers to spend a lot of time, care, and energy in the decision-making process.\n\n1. **Services**: These can vary in involvement, but not all services necessarily involve high perceived risk.\n2. **Perishable items**: These are typically low involvement purchases because they are consumed quickly and are often inexpensive.\n3. **Impulse purchases**: These are characterized by low involvement and spontaneous decision-making.\n4. **Luxury items**: These often involve high perceived risk due to their high cost and the significant impact on the purchaser's finances, leading to high involvement.\n5. **Non-durable goods**: These are typically low involvement as they are consumed quickly and are often inexpensive.\n6. **Discounted items**: These are usually low involvement as the lower price reduces perceived risk.\n7. **Fast-moving consumer goods**: These are typically low involvement as they are purchased frequently and are often inexpensive.\n8. **Durable goods**: These involve high perceived risk because they are expensive and have a long lifespan, leading to high involvement.\n9. **Generic products**: These are usually low involvement as they are often chosen for their lower price.\n10. **Convenience products**: These are typically low involvement as they are purchased frequently and are often inexpensive.\n\nGiven the options, the two that stand out as involving high perceived risk and thus high involvement are **Luxury items** and **Durable goods**. However, the context of the question suggests a broader category that includes various high-involvement purchases, not just luxury items.\n\nTherefore, the best fit is:\n\nThe answer is (H)."

However, without specific details on the premiums for each type of policy, we can only make general observations.\n\n1. **Endowment Policy**: This type of policy combines life insurance with a savings plan. The policyholder pays premiums for a set period (20 years in this case), and at the end of the term, they receive the face value of the policy ($5,000) if they are still alive. If the policyholder dies during the term, the beneficiaries receive the death benefit.\n\n2. **Limited Payment Policy**: This type of policy requires the policyholder to pay premiums for a limited period (20 years in this case), but the coverage continues for the policyholder's entire life. The premiums are typically higher than those for a standard whole life policy because they are paid over a shorter period.\n\nGiven the options provided, we need to select the most plausible cost difference between these two types of policies. Typically, endowment policies are more expensive than limited payment policies due to the savings component and the guaranteed payout at the end of the term.\n\nWithout specific premium rates, we can only make an educated guess. The cost difference is likely to be significant but not extreme. Therefore, the most reasonable option among the provided choices is:\n\nThe answer is (A) $182.45."

The annual premium is $40, and the policy was canceled 90 days after it took effect. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the daily premium rate:\n- There are 365 days in a year.\n- The daily premium rate is $40 / 365 = $0.1095890411 per day.\n\nNext, let's calculate the premium for 90 days:\n- Premium for 90 days = 90 * $0.1095890411 = $9.863013699.\n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios:\n\n### Scenario (a): Cancellation by the policyholder\nWhen the policyholder cancels the policy, they are typically refunded the unused portion of the premium. The policyholder has used 90 days of coverage, so they should be refunded for the remaining days.\n\n- Total premium paid = $40.\n- Premium used for 90 days = $9.863013699.\n- Refund = Total premium paid - Premium used = $40 - $9.863013699 = $30.136986301.\n\n### Scenario (b): Cancellation by the carrier\nWhen the carrier cancels the policy, the refund is usually calculated on a pro-rata basis, meaning the policyholder is refunded for the unused portion of the premium without any penalty.\n\n- Refund = Total premium paid - Premium used = $40 - $9.863013699 = $30.136986301.\n\nHowever, the options provided in the question suggest a slight rounding difference. Let's match the closest options:\n\n- For cancellation by the policyholder: $30.14 (rounded from $30.136986301).\n- For cancellation by the carrier: $30.14 (rounded from $30.136986301).\n\nGiven the options, the closest match is:\n- The answer is (B)."

        "gpt_4_response": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: calculating the monthly payment and determining the true interest rate.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Monthly Payment\n\n1. **Principal Amount (P):** $190\n2. **Annual Service Charge Rate (r):** 8%\n3. **Number of Payments (n):** 6 months\n\nThe service charge is calculated annually, so we need to convert it to a monthly rate. The monthly rate (r_m) is:\n\n\\[ r_m = \\frac{8\\%}{12} = \\frac{0.08}{12} = 0.00667 \\]\n\nThe formula for the monthly payment (M) for an installment loan is:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{P \\times r_m}{1 - (1 + r_m)^{-n}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{190 \\times 0.00667}{1 - (1 + 0.00667)^{-6}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n\\[ 1 - (1 + 0.00667)^{-6} \\approx 1 - (1.00667)^{-6} \\approx 1 - 0.960 \\approx 0.040 \\]\n\nNow, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 190 \\times 0.00667 \\approx 1.2673 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ M \\approx \\frac{1.2673}{0.040} \\approx 31.68 \\]\n\nThus, the monthly payment is approximately $31.67.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the True Interest Rate\n\nTo find the true interest rate, we need to determine the effective annual rate (EAR) based on the monthly payment. The formula for the effective annual rate is:\n\n\\[ (1 + r_m)^{12} - 1 \\]\n\nGiven the monthly rate \\( r_m = 0.00667 \\):\n\n\\[ (1 + 0.00667)^{12} - 1 \\approx 1.083 - 1 = 0.083 \\]\n\nSo, the effective annual rate is approximately 8.3%.\n\nHowever, the true interest rate is typically higher due to the compounding effect. We need to use the APR formula for installment loans, which is more complex and involves solving for the rate that equates the present value of the payments to the loan amount. Given the options, the closest match to our calculated monthly payment and the typical true interest rate for such a loan is:\n\nThe answer is (I)."

Calculate the total cost and total quantity of all purchases:\n   - Inventory, January 1: 800 tubes at $0.252 each = $201.60\n   - Purchase of March 3: 2,000 tubes at $0.247 each = $494.00\n   - Purchase of June 5: 1,500 tubes at $0.262 each = $393.00\n   - Purchase of October 13: 900 tubes at $0.27 each = $243.00\n   - Purchase of November 25: 600 tubes at $0.272 each = $163.20\n\n   Total quantity = 800 + 2,000 + 1,500 + 900 + 600 = 5,800 tubes\n   Total cost = $201.60 + $494.00 + $393.00 + $243.00 + $163.20 = $1,494.80\n\n2. Calculate the average cost per tube:\n   Average cost per tube = Total cost / Total quantity = $1,494.80 / 5,800 = $0.2577\n\n3. Calculate the value of the inventory on hand (1,700 tubes):\n   Value of inventory = 1,700 tubes * $0.2577 = $438.09 (rounded to $438.00)\n\n### (b) FIFO Method\n1. FIFO assumes the oldest inventory is used first. So, we start with the most recent purchases:\n   - November 25: 600 tubes at $0.272 each = $163.20\n   - October 13: 900 tubes at $0.27 each = $243.00\n   - June 5: 200 tubes at $0.262 each = $52.40\n\n   Total value = $163.20 + $243.00 + $52.40 = $458.60\n\n### (c) LIFO Method\n1. LIFO assumes the newest inventory is used first. So, we start with the oldest purchases:\n   - January 1: 800 tubes at $0.252 each = $201.60\n   - March 3: 900 tubes at $0.247 each = $222.30\n\n   Total value = $201.60 + $222.30 = $423.90\n\n### Summary\n- Average Cost: $438.00\n- FIFO: $458.60\n- LIFO: $423.90\n\nThe answer is (I)."

This is more about influencing perception rather than introducing a new product.\nC. **Price skimming**: Setting a high price initially and then lowering it over time. This is often used for new and unique products to maximize profits from early adopters.\nD. **Cost-plus pricing**: Adding a standard markup to the cost of the product. This is a straightforward approach but not necessarily strategic for new, unique products.\nE. **Penetration pricing**: Setting a low price to enter the market quickly and deeply. This is used to attract customers quickly but may not be suitable for unique products that can command a higher price.\nF. **Economy pricing**: Setting a low price to attract price-sensitive customers. This is not typically used for unique products.\nG. **Promotional pricing**: Temporarily reducing prices to increase short-term sales. This is more of a sales tactic than a long-term strategy for new products.\nH. **Competitive pricing**: Setting prices based on competitors. This is not ideal for unique products with no direct competition.\nI. **Premium pricing**: Setting a high price to reflect the exclusivity and quality of the product. This can be suitable for unique products but is more about maintaining a high price rather than introducing a product.\nJ. **Value-based pricing**: Setting prices based on perceived value to the customer. This can be effective but requires a deep understanding of customer perceptions.\n\nGiven that the product is new and unique, **price skimming** (C) is often the most appropriate strategy.

The bond pays $25 every six months for 15 years, and the face value of the bond ($1000) will be paid at the end of the 15 years. The current market interest rate is 4% annually, which translates to 2% per six months.\n\n1. **Calculate the present value of the semi-annual coupon payments:**\n   - Number of periods (n) = 15 years * 2 = 30 periods\n   - Semi-annual coupon payment (C) = $25\n   - Semi-annual market interest rate (r) = 4% / 2 = 2% = 0.02\n\n   The present value of the annuity (coupon payments) can be calculated using the formula for the present value of an annuity:\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = C \\times \\left(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}\\right) / r\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 25 \\times \\left(1 - (1 + 0.02)^{-30}\\right) / 0.02\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 25 \\times \\left(1 - (1.02)^{-30}\\right) / 0.02\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 25 \\times \\left(1 - 0.5523\\right) / 0.02\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 25 \\times 0.4477 / 0.02\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 25 \\times 22.385\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{coupons}} = 559.625\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the present value of the face value:**\n   - Face value (F) = $1000\n   - Present value of the face value (PV_{\\text{face}}) can be calculated using the formula for the present value of a single sum:\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{face}} = F / (1 + r)^n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{face}} = 1000 / (1.02)^{30}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{face}} = 1000 / 1.8114\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{face}} = 552.29\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the present values to get the fair market value of the bond:**\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{total}} = PV_{\\text{coupons}} + PV_{\\text{face}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{total}} = 559.625 + 552.29\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   PV_{\\text{total}} = 1111.915\n   \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the fair market value of the bond is approximately $1111.97.\n\nThe answer is (G)."

Start with the original price, which we can assume to be 100 units for simplicity.\n2. Apply the first discount of 20%:\n   - 20% of 100 units is 20 units.\n   - Subtract this from the original price: 100 - 20 = 80 units.\n3. Apply the second discount of 10% to the new price (80 units):\n   - 10% of 80 units is 8 units.\n   - Subtract this from the new price: 80 - 8 = 72 units.\n4. The final price after both discounts is 72 units.\n5. To find the single discount, calculate the total reduction from the original price:\n   - The original price was 100 units, and the final price is 72 units.\n   - The reduction is 100 - 72 = 28 units.\n6. The single discount as a percentage of the original price is:\n   - (28 / 100) * 100% = 28%.\n\nTherefore, the single discount equivalent to a series of 20% followed by 10% is 28%.\n\nThe answer is (A)."

Therefore, the amount received at the end of the five years is $0.\n\n4. **Beneficiary Payment if the Father Dies at Age 51:**\n   - If the father dies at age 51, which is within the term of the policy, the beneficiary would receive the face value of the policy, which is $15,000.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n- **Option A:** $100.95, $1009.50, $0, $15000\n  - Semiannual premium: $100.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $100.95 * 10 = $1009.50\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $0\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $15,000\n\n- **Option B:** $150, $1800, $15,000, $0\n  - Semiannual premium: $150\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $150 * 10 = $1800\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $0\n\n- **Option C:** $100.95, $1209.50, $15,000, $15,000\n  - Semiannual premium: $100.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $100.95 * 10 = $1009.50 (This seems incorrect)\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $15,000\n\n- **Option D:** $142.95, $1429.50, $0, $15,000\n  - Semiannual premium: $142.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $142.95 * 10 = $1429.50\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $0\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $15,000\n\n- **Option E:** $150, $1500, $0, $15,000\n  - Semiannual premium: $150\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $150 * 10 = $1500\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $0\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $15,000\n\n- **Option F:** $142.95, $1429.50, $15,000, $0\n  - Semiannual premium: $142.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $142.95 * 10 = $1429.50\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $0\n\n- **Option G:** $120.50, $1205.00, $0, $15,000\n  - Semiannual premium: $120.50\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $120.50 * 10 = $1205.00\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $0\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $15,000\n\n- **Option H:** $120.50, $1446.00, $15,000, $0\n  - Semiannual premium: $120.50\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $120.50 * 10 = $1205.00 (This seems incorrect)\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $0\n\n- **Option I:** $142.95, $1715.40, $15,000, $0\n  - Semiannual premium: $142.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $142.95 * 10 = $1429.50 (This seems incorrect)\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $0\n\n- **Option J:** $100.95, $1209.50, $15000, $0\n  - Semiannual premium: $100.95\n  - Total payment over 5 years: $100.95 * 10 = $1009.50 (This seems incorrect)\n  - Amount received at the end of 5 years: $15,000\n  - Beneficiary payment if the father dies at age 51: $0\n\nBased on the correct calculations and the conditions given, the most accurate option is:\n\nThe answer is (D)."

        "gpt_4_response": "To determine the price that maximizes the bookstore's profit per book, we need to set up a profit function and find its maximum.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( p \\) be the selling price per book.\n   - Let \\( q \\) be the quantity of books sold.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - The bookstore can sell the books at $15 each initially.\n   - For every $0.50 reduction in price, 10 more books can be sold.\n\n3. **Price-Quantity Relationship:**\n   - If the price is reduced by \\( x \\) dollars, the number of books sold increases by \\( 20x \\) (since 10 more books are sold for every $0.50 reduction, and $0.50 is half a dollar, so \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\)).\n   - Therefore, the quantity sold \\( q \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     q = 200 + 20 \\left( \\frac{15 - p}{0.50} \\right)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying this:\n     \\[\n     q = 200 + 40 (15 - p)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     q = 200 + 600 - 40p\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     q = 800 - 40p\n     \\]\n\n4. **Profit Function:**\n   - The profit per book is the selling price minus the cost price.\n   - The cost price is $3 per book.\n   - Therefore, the profit per book is \\( p - 3 \\).\n   - The total profit \\( \\Pi \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = (p - 3) \\times q\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\( q \\):\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = (p - 3) \\times (800 - 40p)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = (p - 3)(800 - 40p)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = 800p - 40p^2 - 2400 + 120p\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Pi = -40p^2 + 920p - 2400\n     \\]\n\n5. **Maximizing the Profit Function:**\n   - To find the maximum profit, take the derivative of \\( \\Pi \\) with respect to \\( p \\) and set it to zero:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d\\Pi}{dp} = -80p + 920 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -80p + 920 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     80p = 920\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     p = \\frac{920}{80}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     p = 11.5\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The price that maximizes the bookstore's profit per book is $11.50. However, since the options provided are in whole dollars, we need to check the closest whole dollar amounts to $11.50, which are $11 and $12.\n   - We can compare the profits at $11 and $12 to determine which is higher.\n\n   For \\( p = 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   q = 800 - 40 \\times 11 = 800 - 440 = 360\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Pi = (11 - 3) \\times 360 = 8 \\times 360 = 2880\n   \\]\n\n   For \\( p = 12 \\):\n   \\[\n   q = 800 - 40 \\times 12 = 800 - 480 = 320\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Pi = (12 - 3) \\times 320 = 9 \\times 320 = 2880\n   \\]\n\n   Both prices yield the same profit, but since $11.50 is closer to $11, we choose $11.\n\nThe answer is (A)."
