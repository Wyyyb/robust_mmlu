C. A hydrostatic skeleton is composed of gas-filled chambers that provide buoyancy in fish.
D. A hydrostatic skeleton is a hard shell covering the body
E. A hydrostatic skeleton is the body cavity filled with air that is found in spiders and insects.
F. A hydrostatic skeleton is a network of bones that provide support in amphibians and reptiles.

Answer: G

What is meant by the termtransgressivesegregation? How can it be explained?
A. Transgressive segregation is when there is no variability in the F_2 generation.
B. Transgressive segregation results from the combination of recessive alleles from both parents.
C. Transgressive segregation is the consistent expression of only dominant alleles in the F_2 generation.
D. Transgressive segregation is a process where the F_2 generation remains identical to the parent generation.
E. Transgressive segregation is a process where the F_2 generation shows a reversal of traits compared to the F_1 generation.
F. Transgressive segregation is seen when the variability of an F_2 generation is so great that some individuals show more extreme development than either parental type.
G. Transgressive segregation occurs when the F_2 generation reproduces traits not present in either parent.
H. Transgressive segregation occurs when the F_2 generation shows less variability than the F_1 generation.
I. Transgressive segregation happens when the F_2 generation shows traits that are intermediate between the two parental types.
J. Transgressive segregation only occurs when all active alleles are equal.
