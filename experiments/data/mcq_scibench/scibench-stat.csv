"In the gambling game ""craps,"" a pair of dice is rolled and the outcome of the experiment is the sum of the points on the up sides of the six-sided dice. The bettor wins on the first roll if the sum is 7 or 11. The bettor loses on the first roll if the sum is 2,3 , or 12 . If the sum is $4,5,6$, 8,9 , or 10 , that number is called the bettor's ""point."" Once the point is established, the rule is as follows: If the bettor rolls a 7 before the point, the bettor loses; but if the point is rolled before a 7 , the bettor wins. Find the probability that the bettor wins on the first roll. That is, find the probability of rolling a 7 or 11 , $P(7$ or 11$)$.",$\frac{10}{36}$, $\frac{8}{36}$,$\frac{12}{36}$,$\frac{6}{36}$,B,scibench-stat

"Suppose that the alleles for eye color for a certain male fruit fly are $(R, W)$ and the alleles for eye color for the mating female fruit fly are $(R, W)$, where $R$ and $W$ represent red and white, respectively. Their offspring receive one allele for eye color from each parent. Assume that each of the four possible outcomes has equal probability. If an offspring ends up with either two white alleles or one red and one white allele for eye color, its eyes will look white. Given that an offspring's eyes look white, what is the conditional probability that it has two white alleles for eye color?",$\frac{2}{3}$,$\frac{1}{2}$,$\frac{1}{4}$,$\frac{1}{3}$,D,scibench-stat
