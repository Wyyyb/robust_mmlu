I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.,The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.,The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.,The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.,C,ori_mmlu-miscellaneous_test.csv,True,0.13447071611881256,0.13447071611881256,0.36552929878234863,0.36552929878234863
