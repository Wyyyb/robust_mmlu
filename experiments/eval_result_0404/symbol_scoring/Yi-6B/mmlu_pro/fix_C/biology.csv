"High levels of progesterone are essential for the maintenance of the uterine lining during pregnancy. But high levels of progesterone exerts a negative feedback action on LH secretion, with a consequent decrease in LH secretion and eventual atrophy of the corpus luteum. Atrophy of the corpus luteum cuts the progesterone supply resulting in menstruation. Clearly, these events cannot take place after conception, or the embryo would get sloughed off. When conception occurs, the corpus luteum is seen to last through most of pregnancy. How can this be explained?",The corpus luteum is not necessary during pregnancy.,The embryo secretes a hormone to preserve the corpus luteum.,"The placenta secretes a hormone, chorionic gonadotrophin, which takes the place of LH in preserving the corpus luteum.
