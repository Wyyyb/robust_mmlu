The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. So, we must find the work in tiny little displacements and then add up all the work results. We effectively say, ""Yes, the force varies over any given tiny little displacement, but the variation is so small we can approximate the force as being constant during the displacement."" Sure, it is not precise, but if we make the displacements infinitesimal, then our error becomes infinitesimal and the result becomes precise.
