"From the very beginning, I wrote to explain my own life to myself, and I invited any readers who chose to make the journey with me to join me on the high wire.

I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.,The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.,The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.,The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.,A,ori_mmlu-miscellaneous,False,0.1232389286160469,0.12621308863162994,0.6537026762962341,0.0968453511595726
