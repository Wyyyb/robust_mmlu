In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?,State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.,The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.,"With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.",The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.,C,ori_mmlu-security_studies,False,0.3879733681678772,0.2644517421722412,0.1767619401216507,0.17081290483474731

In what ways do theories of conventional and critical social constructivism differ?,"Conventional constructivism refers to the earlier works of social constructivist theorists that are characterised by a rejection of positivist methodology. Critical constructivists challenge these theories, embracing positivist methodologies in their work.","Critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism to be its ability to bridge rationalist and reflectivity approaches. Conversely, social constructivists regard this as an unhelpful regression to positivist binary frameworks of analysis.","Conventional constructivists view constructivism as a bridge between rationalist and reflectivist approaches, enabling both to benefit from the insights of the other.

In what ways has the concept of environmental security been contested?,"The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.",Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.,"Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.","The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security.

How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?,Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.,The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.,"The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.",Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

What has been the effect of biological weapons on national security in the international community?,"The West, notably Canada, Britain, and the US, have conducted research into the weaponization of Anthrax, Tularemia, Q-fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and anti-agricultural agents. However biological weapons were generally viewed in the West as lacking military utility. Instead strategists have concentrated on nuclear and conventional capabilities.","The Soviet Union carried out the most extensive research program into genetic engineering to weaponize naturally occurring diseases.

In what ways may TNC be regarded as a new concept?,Organized transnational crime groups are those structured groups randomly formed or otherwise but do not have a formally defined role for its members or continuity of membership but have a developed purpose for the intent of committing crimes.,"Transnational criminal organizations are those organizations whose modes of operation result in breaking domestic laws, e.g. murder, theft or money-laundering, underlined by the employment of systematic violence.",Transnational organized criminal activities consist of profit driven crime for a high level return that may result in the subversion or infiltration of the legal economy through the reinvestment of illicit profits.,The terms 'transnational crime' and 'organized crime' are sometimes used interchangeably but not all transnational crime will be committed by an organized group nor will all organized groups engage in transnational crime.

In what ways does gender shape the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict?,"Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the glorification of female attributes such as the ability to bear children.

What are the practical problems associated with applying coercive diplomacy in the West?,"Coalitional coercive diplomacy is the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary.

In what ways is it possible to gain a definition of terrorism?,"A terrorist attack is that which uses the threat or use of organized violence to achieve political objectives. This may include kidnappings and organized violence for financial gain, and such attacks can be undertaken by groups or individuals.","Terrorist violence is a form of psychological warfare that generates fear in a target audience by attacking members of that group.

Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?,The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project.

What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.","Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.","Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians.

As a field of research peace studies adopts a Euro-centric approach to security and has thus been defined by developments within the West and wealthier nations.","Peace studies developed after the Second World War as a response to the failure of International Relations to prevent global conflict following World War I. Initially, the field was conditioned by the nuclear arms race and East-West divide that characterised the Cold War, but was quick to embrace environmental concerns and the issues surrounding the North-South wealth/poverty divide.","Developed as a response to World War I, peace studies focuses on disparities in wealth and resource allocation that exist within the global system, with the aim of promoting peace through the equal distribution of these resources.",C,ori_mmlu-security_studies,False,0.23123300075531006,0.3811700642108917,0.27866342663764954,0.10893348604440689

In what ways has conflict been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states?,"Environmental change can be a cause of war between countries, largely centred on resource scarcity interrelated with conflict. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.","Population growth and its relationship to environmental degradation can lead to environmentally caused conflict. There is therefore a linear link between population growth and environmental change, and environmental change is the critical determinant in the production of violence.",Analysis of environmental violence research shows that there is a tendency among 'strong states' to be less prone to internal violent conflicts whereas states undergoing significant economic and political transitions are more prone to violent conflict. Environmental change is unlikely to be a cause of war but can be a contributory factor.,"Common findings in research organizations investigating environmental violence have failed to find quantifiable relationships between environmental and social variables and the cause of war.

What is the 'security dilemma' that faces weak states?,"The weak state insecurity dilemma emerges out of competition between each component of society to preserve and protect the longevity of their well-being and interests. However, the ruling elite remain separate from the social sphere of contestation producing a policy dilemma; use of the monopoly of instruments of violence to restore order will reduce the regime's infrastructural core.","The weak state insecurity dilemma is primarily an external condition creating a situation for the weak state similar to structural anarchy, wherein a weak state creates insecurity in the region when taking measures to improve its own regional standing.",The inability of the state to provide stability creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. The condition is self-perpetuating - a semi-permanent situation of emergent anarchy because measures to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.,"Weak state insecurity dilemmas are born out of a lack of political and institutional centring with a monopoly of force. However, the engagement of armed forces to strengthen institutions may stop this process. Inability to foster 'stateness' is reversed by the use of violence.

What internal security policy options are available to elites?,"Elites create negative inducements for non support of the regime. Redistribution as a means of denial to the power structure in the form of ""elite disenfranchisement"" which may include diversion of resources, disarmament and denial of access to commercial activity routes.",Elites attempt to foster a new politics of identity in which ethnic consciousness is superseded by ideologies orientated around the myth of the regime.,"Lacking infrastructural capacity and wider social legitimacy, weak state elites are often forced to rely on coercive power.

Are strategies of Arms Control and Deterrence useful in cyber-security?,"No, arms control does not serve any purpose outside the realm of traditional military weapons.","Yes, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.","Effective deterrence requires international cooperation which is achievable in theory, but the verification required for traditional arms control strategies is impossible in cyber(ed) warfare.","Only arms control is unproblematic, deterrence has failed because international cooperation cannot be reached and common rules or practices cannot be established.",C,ori_mmlu-security_studies,False,0.05316637083888054,0.7500131130218506,0.07662933319807053,0.12019118666648865

What is the future of WMD?,"The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit. Whilst they may serve some utility as a framework for diplomatic exchanges, they are essentially toothless bodies lacking the political will to establish an authority with the powers to police the control and use of these weapons.",The International Non-proliferation Regime has been rendered effectively defunct in the post-Cold War climate. State actors seeking to develop their own weapons capabilities have de-stabilized norms governing the use and control of WMD. This has been evidenced by severe splits in the body following the 1998 Indian and Pakistani nuclear testing and the withdrawal of great power support following the US Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.,"WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today's policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.",Contemporary concern has been pacified by the fact that WMD threat has greatly diminished with the end of the Cold War.

In which ways does realism differ from social constructivism in the theorisation of identity within international relations?,"Social constructivism employs theories of causality in the study of international relations, in addition to prioritising the study of identity as a socially constructed theory. In contrast, realism regards state of actor behaviour in the international system to follow an 'action-response' pattern.",Realism regards identity as a crucial point for consideration in international relations. Realist theory is based on the assumption that identity informs behaviour.,Realism is based in the notion of causality whilst social constructivism relies on theories of identity that are based in intersubjective meanings.,"Social constructivists regard the state as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system, whilst realists regard state interaction as being the natural progression of identity formulation.",C,ori_mmlu-security_studies,False,0.5612521171569824,0.1605418622493744,0.14362236857414246,0.13458365201950073

What preventative security measures might a government take in defence of a potential future terrorist attack?,"Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.","Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.",Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).,"Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control.",C,ori_mmlu-security_studies,True,0.2699549198150635,0.12434132397174835,0.3868124485015869,0.21889133751392365
