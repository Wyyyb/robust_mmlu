"For its Sanford to Marksville short run,SutlandAirlines has first class, tourist class, and coach accommodations. Packets of three tickets each, called 3-Paks, are available at a special discount. If tickets are sold in accordance with seating capacity, because of ""no shows"" it often happens that flights are not made at full capacity, thus losing money forSutland. IfSutlandoversells a flight and there are not enough cancellations or ""no shows"" to balance the oversubscription, then some passengers are going to be inconvenienced until new arrangements are made. It has been found that passengers thus inconvenienced exhibit essentially three kinds of reaction: I. The passenger who heartily cursesSutlandand then forgets all about his ordeal after new arrangements have been made; II. The passenger who becomes so angry that he never fliesSutlandagain; and III. The passenger whose anger is so great that he never fliesSutlandagain and campaigns to stop other people from flyingSutland. The effects of these reactions have been thoroughly studied, and an annoyance scale has been developed so that these effects can be described in quantitative terms. For a given flight 15 points of reaction I (measured on the annoyance scale), 12 points of reaction II, and 9 points of reaction III can be tolerated at most. Table 1 was developed and distributed to the executives ofSutlandwho are involved in customer relations. From an analysis of the past earnings ofSutlandAirlines, the expected profit on a 3-Pak of first class tickets is $10, the expected profit on a 3-Pak of tourist class tickets is $12, and a 3-Pak of coach tickets nets $14.

"Suppose Q is a measure of output, K is a measure of capital stock in use, and L is a measure of the size of the employed labor force. Q =AK^\betaL^\gamma is a much used form of production function. When \beta + \gamma = 1, it is known as a Cobb-Douglas production function. This function has many convenient properties: Marginal products of both labor and capital are positive if \beta and \gamma are. If \beta + \gamma = 1, the function has constant returns to scale. That is, if both inputs are increased in like proportion, output will increase in that same proportion. A doubling of both inputs, for example, will result in doubled output.

"Flapjack Computers is interested in developing a new tape drive for a proposed new computer. Flapjack does not have research personnel available to develop the new drive itself and so is going to sub-contract the development to an independent research firm. Flapjack has set a fee of $250,000 for developing the new tape drive and has asked for bids from various research firms. The bid is to be awarded not on the basis of price (set at $250,000) but on the basis of both the technical plan shown in the bid and the firm's reputation. Dyna Research Institute is considering submitting a proposal (i.e., a bid) to Flapjack to develop the new tape drive. Dyna Research Management estimated that it would cost about $50,000 to prepare a proposal; further they estimated that the chances were about 50-50 that they would be awarded the contract. There was a major concern among Dyna Research engineers concerning exactly how they would develop the tape drive if awarded the con-tract. There were three alternative approaches that could be tried. One involved the use of certain electronic components. The engineers estimated that it would cost only $50,000 to develop a prototype of the tape drive using the electronic approach, but that there was only a 50 percent chance that the prototype would be satisfactory. A second approach involved the use of certain magnetic apparatus. The cost of developing a prototype using this approach would cost $80,000 with 70 percent chance of success. Finally, there was a mechanical approach with cost of $120,000, but the engineers were certain of success. Dyna Research could have sufficient time to try only two approaches. Thus, if either the magnetic or the electronic approach tried and failed, the second attempt would have to use the mechanical approach in order to guarantee a successful prototype. The management of Dyna Research was uncertain how to take all this information into account in making the immediate decision-whether to spend $50,000 to develop a proposal for Flapjack.
