 The ovule of a rose is analogous to the capsule of a moss. The ovule of a rose produces spores that do not require fertilization, while the capsule of a moss produces spores that do. The ovule of a rose is the female reproductive part, while the capsule of a moss is the male reproductive part. The ovule of a rose gives rise to bisexual gametophytes, while the capsule of a moss produces only male spores. The ovule of a rose and the capsule of a moss differ in that the ovule produces only those spores which will develop into female gametophytes, while the capsule produces spores which will give rise to bisexual gametophytes. The ovule of a rose is involved in sexual reproduction, while the capsule of a moss is not. The ovule of a rose is part of the gametophyte generation, while the capsule of a moss is part of the sporophyte generation. The capsule of a moss disperses pollen, which is similar to the role of the ovule in a rose. The answer

 According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{rac{1}{100}} = 0.01$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.99$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.01 \cdot 0.99 = 0.0198$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.0198 * 100 = 1.98$. So we end up with 1.9

 The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that the frequency of the dominant allele (p) plus the frequency of the recessive allele (q) equals 1. If the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.5, then the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.5. If the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.5, then the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.5. If the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.5, then the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.5. If the frequency of the dominant allele is 0.5, then the frequency of the recessive allele is 0.5.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on economics for help. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. The GDP is calculated using the total expenditure approach. The GDP is calculated as follows:
GDP = Consumption Expenditures + Wages and salaries + (Gross Private) Investments Expenditures + Government Expenditures + Taxes + Imports - Exports

Consumption Expenditures = $500 billion
Wages and salaries = $400 billion
(Gross Private) Investments Expenditures = $80 billion
Government Expenditures = $100 billion
Taxes = $70 billion
Imports = $50 billion
Exports = $30 billion

The GDP is calculated as follows:
GDP = $500 billion + $400 billion + $80 billion + $100 billion + $70 billion + $50 billion - $30 billion

The GDP is $730 billion. The answer

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on mathematics for help. We can use the following formula to solve this problem:

$$\begin{align}
\text{Electric bill} &= 328 \times 0.043 + 1400 \times 0.0318 + 128 \times 0.0179 \\
&= 14.96 + 43.92 + 2.22 \\
&= 60.10

$$\begin{align}
\text{Gas bill} &= 600 \times 0.0320 + 800 \times 0.0253 \\
&= 19.20 + 20.08 \\

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on finance for help. The company has a permit to mine for gold in a region of New Mexico for 3 years. Management is trying to decide how to finance the machinery. One option is to rent it for $130 per month over the three years. The deal includes the fuel needed to operate the equipment. The other option is to buy the equipment now and. it after three years. The machinery costs $11,500. There is a down payment of $2,500, so that the balance due will be $11,500 - $2,500 = $9,000. This balance will be covered by a 5(1/2)% loan to be paid in equal annual installments over 15 years. The annual fuel costs for the equipment would be $375. If the minimum attractive rate of return is 5%, at what resale value (end of third year) will both options be equally economical? Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on marketing for help. The Experimental Company is now producing and selling 17,000 units of product per year at a sales price of $250 each. It has had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment. Its present cost structure is as follows: Manufacturing costs: Fixed costs $400,000 per year Variable costs $175 per unit produced Selling and administration expenses: Fixed expenses $135,000 per year Variable expenses $25 per unit sold Ten hours are required to produce a unit of product. The company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100 percent of its capacity-20,000 units of product. It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume. In addition, it believes that it can increase its sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit, and with accompanying promotion that will increase its variable selling and administration expenses

 The answer is given in the question as 1.273g. We can use the equation $M_{1} = M_{2} \cdot \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$ to determine the amount of copper deposited. $M_{1} = M_{2} \cdot \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$ where $M_{1}$ is the mass of Ag deposited, $M_{2}$ is the mass of Cu deposited, $n_{1}$ is the number of Ag atoms deposited, and $n_{2}$ is the number of Cu atoms deposited. We can determine the number of Cu atoms deposited by dividing the mass of Cu deposited by the atomic mass of Cu. $n_{2} = \frac{M_{2}}{A_{Cu}}$ where $A_{Cu}$ is the atomic mass of Cu. We can determine the number of Ag atoms deposited by dividing the mass of Ag deposited by the atomic mass of Ag. $n_{1} = \frac{M_{1}}{A_{Ag}}$.

 The chemist wants to obtain 4.6 × 10^9 J of energy. We know that 1 ton of TNT can produce 4.6 × 10^9 J of energy. We also know that the ∆H\textdegree = - 2510 KJ for the reaction between C_2 H_2 and O_2. We can use the equation $∆H = \frac{E}{n}$ to solve for $n$. We have $∆H = \frac{4.6 \cdot 10^9}{n}$ and $n = \frac{4.6 \cdot 10^9}{∆H}$. We can then solve for $n$ by dividing both sides by $∆H$.

 The effusion rate of a gas is given by the equation $J = \frac{1}{2} \pi R T \Delta P$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference. In this case, the effusion rate is $J = \frac{1}{2} \pi R T \Delta P = \frac{1}{2} \pi R T \frac{1}{1000} = 0.0005 \pi R T$. The effusion rate is proportional to the square root of the pressure difference, so we can write $J = \sqrt{\Delta P}$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = \sqrt{\Delta P} = \sqrt{1000} = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J = 100$. The effusion rate is therefore $J =
