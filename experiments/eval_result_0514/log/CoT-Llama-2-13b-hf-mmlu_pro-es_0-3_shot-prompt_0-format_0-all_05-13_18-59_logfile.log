 The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$, where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. The frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 0.7, and the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 0.3. We have $p = 0.7$ and $q = 0.3$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (

 Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and by poor emotional responsiveness. It most commonly begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms may include hearing voices, believing things that are not true, or having difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imagined. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms of schizophrenia are typically categorized as positive and negative. Positive symptoms are psychotic behaviors not generally seen in healthy people. These symptoms can sometimes be mistaken for symptoms of bipolar disorder. Positive symptoms of schizophrenia include:

* Hallucinations, such as hearing voices
* Delusions, such as paranoia
* Disorganized speech
* Disorganized or catatonic behavior

Negative symptoms are associated with disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include:

* Flat affect, or reduced expression of emotions

 Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection, which states that organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to the next generation. Darwin also proposed the theory of sexual selection, which states that organisms with favorable traits are more likely to attract mates and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to the next generation. Darwin also proposed the theory of genetic drift, which states that random events such as natural disasters or disease outbreaks can cause the loss of genetic variation in a population, leading to the extinction of that population. Darwin also proposed the theory of mutation, which states that random changes in the DNA of an organism can lead to the creation of new traits. Darwin also proposed the theory of adaptation, which states that organisms can adapt to their environment by changing their behavior or physiology.

The low bid for a job is a random variable that is uniformly distributed, over the interval ( 3c / 4 , 2c) where c is the contractor's cost estimate (no profit or loss) of the job. If profit is defined as zero if the contractor does not get the job (his bid is greater than the low bid) and as the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job, what should he bid, in terms of c, in order to maximize his expected profit?

The expected profit is the probability of getting the job times the profit if he gets the job.

The probability of getting the job is the probability that his bid is less than the low bid.

The probability that his bid is less than the low bid is the probability that his bid is less than the low bid, given that the low bid is less than 2c, times the probability that the low bid is less than 2c.

\begin{equation}
P = \int_{0}^{\frac{1}{2} L} \psi^{*}(x) \psi(x) dx

 The ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom. The energy of the photon is given by $h \nu = E_i$. We can rearrange this to give $E_i = h \nu / c$. The speed of light is $c = 3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. The wavelength of the photon is $58.4 \mathrm{~nm} = 5.84 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}$. The energy of the photon is therefore $E_i = 3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} / 5.84 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{~m} = 5.14 \times 10^7 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

 The maximum wavelength of the earth's blackbody radiation is the wavelength at which the radiation is emitted at the maximum rate. The maximum rate of emission is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the maximum rate of emission is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The maximum rate of emission is therefore proportional to $T^4$. The maximum rate of emission is also proportional to the area of the blackbody, which is proportional to the square of the radius of the blackbody. The maximum rate of emission is therefore proportional to $T^4 \cdot R^2$. The maximum rate of emission is therefore proportional to $T^4 \cdot R^2$. The maximum rate of emission is therefore proportional to $T^4 \cdot R^2$. The maximum rate of emission is therefore proportional to $T^4 \cdot R^2$.

 The mass absorption coefficient is the amount of radiation absorbed per unit mass of material. The half thickness is the thickness of a material that will absorb half of the radiation. The mass absorption coefficient is given by the equation:

$$\frac{dI}{dx} = - \frac{1}{x} \cdot \rho \cdot \mu$$

Where $dI/dx$ is the decrease in intensity per unit distance, $\rho$ is the density of the material, and $\mu$ is the mass absorption coefficient.

We can rearrange this equation to give:

$$\frac{dI}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \cdot \rho \cdot \mu$$

We can then substitute in the values we have been given:

$$\frac{dI}{dx} = \frac{1}{1.5 cm} \cdot 9.80 \cdot 10^3 kg m^-3 \cdot 12 g cm^-2$$

$$\frac{dI}{dx} = 1.62 \cdot 10^3 g cm^-2$$

 The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The formula for the half-life of a radioactive substance is $t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{ln(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is the decay constant. The decay constant for a radioactive substance is equal to the number of half-lives per unit time. The number of half-lives per unit time is equal to the reciprocal of the half-life. Therefore, the number of half-lives per unit time is equal to $1/t_{1/2}$. The number of half-lives per unit time is equal to $1/t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{0.693/ln(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{0.693/ln(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{1/t_{1/2}} = \frac{1}{0.693/ln(2)} \cdot \frac{1}{1/t_{1/2}}

 The equation of state is P(V - nb')exp [(na') / (RTV)] = nRT(1)

We can rearrange this to get:

P(V - nb')exp [(na') / (RTV)] = nRT

We can then divide both sides by nRT to get:

P(V - nb')exp [(na') / (RTV)] = 1

We can then take the natural logarithm of both sides to get:

ln P(V - nb')exp [(na') / (RTV)] = ln 1

We can then divide both sides by ln 1 to get:

ln P(V - nb')exp [(na') / (RTV)] = 0

We can then take the exponential of both sides to get:

 The simple form of the Osmotic pressure equation is:
$$P = \frac{nRT}{V - n}$$
Where $n$ is the number of moles of solute, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $V$ is the volume of the solution.

We are given the number of moles of solute, $n$, and the volume of the solution, $V$. We can use the molecular weight of the solute, $MW$, to calculate the number of moles of solute.
$$n = \frac{MW}{MW + MW_solvent}$$

We can then plug this into the Osmotic pressure equation to solve for $P$.
$$P = \frac{nRT}{V - n}$$
$$P = \frac{\frac{MW}{MW + MW_solvent}RT}{V - \frac{MW}{MW + MW_solvent}}$$
$$P = \frac{MWRT}{MW + MW_solvent} \cdot \frac{V - MW}{V - \frac{MW}{MW + MW_solvent}}$$

 The average adult loses 1.0 liters of liquid water per day as urine, 0.6 liters of liquid water per day as sweat, 0.1 liters of liquid water per day as fecal matter, and 0.4 liters of liquid water per day in expired air. We can calculate the total amount of liquid water lost per day by adding these values together. The total amount of liquid water lost per day is therefore 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.1 + 0.4 = 2.1 liters per day. We can calculate the total amount of liquid water lost per year by multiplying the total amount of liquid water lost per day by 365. The total amount of liquid water lost per year is therefore 2.1 × 365 = 778.5 liters per year. We can calculate the total amount of liquid water lost per 60 years by multiplying the total amount of liquid water lost per year by 60. The total amount of liquid water lost per 60 years is therefore 778.5 × 60 = 46,710 liters.

 The Svedberg equation is:
$$
\frac{1}{S} = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{V} + \frac{1}{D}
$$
where $S$ is the sedimentation coefficient, $S_0$ is the partial specific volume, $V$ is the specific volume, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.

We can rearrange the equation to:
$$
S = \frac{1}{S_0} + \frac{1}{V} + \frac{1}{D}
$$

We can then substitute the values we have for $S_0$, $V$, and $D$ to get:
$$
S = \frac{1}{0.707} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{13.1 \times 10^{-7}}

 The density of a gas is equal to the mass of the gas divided by the volume of the gas. The volume of the gas is equal to the mass of the gas divided by the density of the gas. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to get the density of the gas as:
$$\begin{align}
\text{Density} &= \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} \\
\text{Density} &= \frac{\text{Mass}}{\frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Density}}} \\
\text{Density} &= \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Mass}} \\
\text{Density} &= 1
\end{align}$$

Therefore, the density of the gas is equal to 1. The mass of the gas is equal to the density of the gas multiplied by the volume of the gas. Therefore, we can rearrange the equation to get the mass of the gas as:

 The hyperfine splitting is the difference in energy between the two energy levels of the electron. The hyperfine splitting is given by the equation:
$$\Delta E = \frac{g_i}{2} \mu_B B_0^2$$
where $g_i$ is the g-factor of the electron, $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $B_0$ is the magnetic field. The g-factor of the electron is $g_i = 2.0023$.

 The first step is to determine the percentage of alcohol in the mixture. The mixture is 84 percent alcohol, so we need to determine the percentage of alcohol in the 74 percent alcohol solution. We can do this by dividing 74 by 100, which gives us 0.74. We can then multiply this by 84, which gives us 62.36. This means that the 74 percent alcohol solution is 62.36 percent alcohol. We can then do the same thing for the 90 percent alcohol solution. We can divide 90 by 100, which gives us 0.9. We can then multiply this by 84, which gives us 75.6. This means that the 90 percent alcohol solution is 75.6 percent alcohol. We can then add the two percentages together, which gives us 137.96. This means that the mixture is 137.96 percent alcohol.

The paper shows that the attacker can recover the private key if the attacker can measure the time it takes to compute the discrete logarithm of a random number.

 Currying is the process of reducing a function with multiple arguments to a function with fewer arguments. For example, the function add takes two real numbers and returns a real number. We can curry this function by creating a new function that takes a single real number and returns a function that takes a single real number and returns a real number.
This process can be repeated as many times as we like. For example, we can curry the function add again to create a function that takes a single real number and returns a function that takes a single real number and returns a real number.

 The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored.

So, we have 12 microseconds for the external analog-to-digital converter to digitize one input, and 5 CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{s(a,b,c) \cdot (s(a,b,c) - a) \cdot (s(a,b,c) - b) \cdot (s(a,b,c) - c)}\]

where \(s(a,b,c)\) is the semiperimeter of the triangle, which is given by

\[s(a,b,c) = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\]

Thus, the area of a triangle is given by the formula

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a + b + c}{2} \cdot (\frac{a + b + c}{2} - a) \cdot (\frac{a + b + c}{2} - b) \cdot (\frac{a + b + c}{2} - c)}\]

 The paper describes a timing attack on the openSSL implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. The attacker can measure the time it takes to compute the discrete logarithm of a public key. The attacker can then use this timing information to recover the private key.
The paper describes four optimizations that are used in the openSSL implementation: Chinese Remainder (CR), Montgomery Representation (MR), Karatsuba Multiplication (KM), and Repeated squaring and Sliding windows (RS).
The paper shows that the attacker can recover the private key if the attacker can measure the time it takes to compute the discrete logarithm of a public key. The paper also shows that the attacker can recover the private key if the attacker can measure the time it takes to compute the discrete logarithm of a public key using the openSSL implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on corporate finance for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
First, we need to calculate the taxable income. The taxable income is equal to the following:
taxable income = sales - cost of goods sold - administrative expenses - depreciation - all other expenses - retained earnings
We know that sales are $3,000,000; cost of goods sold is $1,500,000; administrative expenses are $300,000; depreciation is $800,000; all other expenses are $100,000; and retained earnings are $100,000. Thus, we have:
taxable income = $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 - $300,000 - $800,000 - $100,000 - $100,000 = $1,300,000
Next, we need to calculate the taxable income multiplied by the tax rate.

First, we need to find the marginal physical product of capital. We know that the production of a unit of good Y requires the employment of 3 workers and 7 units of capital. The going wage is $4. The rent on a unit of capital is $1. Thus, we have:
marginal physical product of capital = (7 * $1) / (3 * $4) = 7 / 12 = 0.5833333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

First, we know that the bank has made a total of $100,000 in loans and still has excess reserves of $25,000.
Second, we know that the required reserve ratio is 10%.
Third, we know that other liabilities and net worth are just matched by assets other than loans and reserves.
Fourth, we know that the bank's demand deposit liabilities are equal to the following:
bank's demand deposit liabilities = (total loans) + (excess reserves) + (other liabilities) + (net worth)
Thus, we have:
bank's demand deposit liabilities = $100,000 + $25,000 + (other liabilities) + (net worth)
Fifth, we know that the bank's demand deposit liabilities must be equal to the following:

We know that the supply schedule of firm 3 is given by Q_3^S = 32 + 8P.
We know that the supply schedule of firm 4 is given by Q_4^S = 60 - 10P.
We know that the combined supply is equal to the sum of the supply schedules of each firm. Thus, we have:
Q^S_total = Q_1^S + Q_2^S + Q_3^S + Q_4^S
We know that Q_1^S = 16 + 4P.
We know that Q_2^S = 5 - 5P.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. We know that the public wishes to hold 15 percent of its total money balances as cash, the remainder in the form of bank deposits, and banks hold cash reserves equal to 12 per-cent of the deposits. Thus, we have:
15% of total money balances = cash held by the public
85% of total money balances = bank deposits
12% of bank deposits = cash reserves held by banks
Thus, we have:
15% of total money balances = cash held by the public
85% of total money balances = bank deposits
12% of bank deposits = cash reserves held by banks
Thus, we have:
15% of total money balances = cash held by the public

12% of bank deposits = cash reserves held by banks
Thus, we have:

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. The simple circular flow model is a model of the economy in which the major exchanges are between households and firms. The model describes the flows of goods and services, productive inputs, and money, between economic agents. The model is a visual simplification of the basic economic concepts of microeconomics, which includes production, exchange, consumption, and investment. The model assumes that the economy is closed, which means that no goods or services are imported or exported. The model also assumes that there is no government spending or taxation. The model is a static model, which means that it does not take into account the effects of time. The model is a simplification of the real world, and as such, it has some limitations. First, the model does not take into account the effects of inflation. Second, the model does not take into account the effects of population growth. Third, the model does not take into account the effects of technological change. Fourth, the model does not take into account the effects of international trade.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Say's Law states that supply creates its own demand. Say's Law is a theory that suggests that supply creates its own demand. This means that if people produce goods and services, then they will also be able to buy those goods and services. Say's Law is often used to justify laissez-faire economics, which is the idea that the government should not interfere in the economy.
Say's Law is often criticized for being too simplistic and for not taking into account the fact that people may not always spend all of their income. For example, if people save a portion of their income, then that money is not being spent on goods and services, which could lead to a decrease in demand.
Say's Law is also often criticized for being too optimistic about the economy. For example, if there is a recession, then people may not be able to buy as many goods and services, which could lead to a decrease in demand.

Current government expenditures are $270 billion per year. The full capacity GNP level is $1,060 billion. Thus, we have:
current deficit = (25% of $1,060 billion) + $60 billion + $2.5 billion - $270 billion = $270 billion + $60 billion + $2.5 billion - $270 billion = $270 billion + $60 billion + $2.5 billion - $270 billion = $270 billion + $60 billion + $2.5 billion - $270 billion = $270 billion + $60 billion + $2.5 billion - $270 billion = $270 billion + $60 billion + $2.5 billion -

We know that the initial money supply is equal to the initial money supply times the required reserve ratio. Thus, we have:
initial money supply = initial money supply * required reserve ratio
We know that the initial money supply is equal to the initial money supply times the excess reserves. Thus, we have:
initial money supply = initial money supply * excess reserves
We know that the initial money supply is equal to the initial money supply times the currency held by the public. Thus, we have:
initial money supply = initial money supply * currency held by the public
We know that the initial money supply is equal to the initial money supply plus the amount of government bonds purchased by the FED. Thus, we have:

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
First, we need to compute the marginal profit. We know that the total profit function is equal to:
Total Profit = \pi = - $3,000 - $2,400 Q + $350Q^2 - $8.333Q^3
We know that the marginal profit is equal to the derivative of the total profit function. Thus, we have:
marginal profit = \frac{d\pi}{dQ} = - $3,000 - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2 + $8.333Q^2
We can simplify the marginal profit equation as follows:
marginal profit = - $3,000 - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2 + $8.333Q^2
marginal profit = - $3,000 - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2 + $8.

 The specific humidity of a mixture of air and water vapor is given by the equation:

Specific humidity = (mass of water vapor)/(mass of dry air)

The initial specific humidity is given by the equation:

Specific humidity = (mass of water vapor)/(mass of dry air) = (0.55 * 0.00802lbm/lbm)/(1.00 - 0.55 * 0.00802lbm/lbm) = 0.00802lbm/lbm

The final specific humidity is given by the equation:

Specific humidity = (mass of water vapor)/(mass of dry air) = (0.55 * 0.00802lbm/lbm)/(1.00 - 0.55 * 0.00802lbm/lbm) = 0.00802lbm/lbm

The final relative humidity is given by the equation:

The final volume is given by the initial volume minus the final pressure, which is 35 ft³ - 6237.6 psia = 35 ft³ - 6237.6 * 14.696 = 35 ft³ - 91,993.6 = 91,993.

In this case, the heat added to the system is zero, since the process is adiabatic, and the work done by the system is equal to the change in pressure times the volume. So we have that

 The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. In this case, the heat added to the system is the heat of vaporization of water, which is 2260 J/g. The work done by the system is the pressure-volume work, which is given by PV. So we have that dU = 2260 J/g - PV. We can solve for PV by using the ideal gas law, which states that PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles of gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature.

 The number of teeth on the driving sprocket is given by the formula (N1 * N2)/(N1 + N2), where N1 is the number of teeth on the driving sprocket, N2 is the number of teeth on the driven sprocket, and N1 + N2 is the number of teeth on the two sprockets combined. So we have that (15 * 1400)/(15 + 1400) = 10. The number of teeth on the driven sprocket is given by the formula (N1 * N2)/(N1 + N2), where N1 is the number of teeth on the driving sprocket, N2 is the number of teeth on the driven sprocket, and N1 + N2 is the number of teeth on the two sprockets combined. So we have that (15 * 700)/(15 + 700) = 14. The kind of lubrication needed is given by the formula (N1 * N2)/(N1 + N2), where N1 is the number of teeth on the driving sprocket, N2 is the number

 The dew point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the mixture is equal to the pressure of the gas. The vapor pressure of a pure substance is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is P = P_0 exp(H/RT), where P is the vapor pressure, P_0 is the vapor pressure of the pure substance, H is the enthalpy of vaporization, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. The enthalpy of vaporization of benzene is 35.7 kJ/mol, and the enthalpy of vaporization of n-pentane is 34.1 kJ/mol. So the vapor pressure of the mixture is given by P = P_0 exp(35.7/8.314 * 10^3 + 34.1/8.314 * 10^3)/(8.314 * 10^3 * 1) = 0.00000000000000000000000000

 The heat equation is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 T
\end{equation}
where T is the temperature, t is time, and \kappa is the thermal conductivity. We can solve this equation using separation of variables, and we find that
\begin{equation}
T(r,t) = T_0(r)e^{-\kappa t}
\end{equation}
where T_0(r) is the temperature distribution at time t = 0. We can find T_0(r) by integrating the heat equation over the shell, and we find that
\begin{equation}
T_0(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi r^2}\int_0^r \frac{1}{r'^2} \frac{dQ}{dr'} dr'
\end{equation}
where Q is the heat flux. We can find Q by integrating the heat equation over the shell, and we find that
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{1}{4\pi r^2}\int_0^r \frac{1

 The heat transfer equation for natural convection is:

\begin{equation}
\dot{Q} = hA(T_{sat}-T_{amb})
\end{equation}

where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, Tsat is the saturation temperature, and Tamb is the ambient temperature.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for the heat transfer rate:

\begin{equation}
\dot{Q} = hA(T_{sat}-T_{amb})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{Q} = hA(100-50)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dot{Q} = 2.0 Btu/hr sq ft R * 100 sq ft * 100 Btu/hr * 1 ft

 The cost of making the correct decisions for the given binary channel is zero, i.e., c(d_1/x_1) = c(d_2/x_2) = 0. The cost of making the incorrect decision d_1 is twice as much as that of making the incorrect decision d_2. That is to say, c(d_1/x_2) = 2c(d_2/x_1) which decision should be made, first, (a) When a y_1 is received, and (b) When a y_2 is received? GivenP(y_1/x_1) = 0.8, P(y_2/x_2) = 0.6, andP(x_1) = 0.8

 The local convective heat transfer coefficient is given by h = (k/ρcp)1/3, where k is the thermal conductivity, ρ is the density, c is the specific heat capacity, and p is the pressure. So we have that h = (1.6e6/1000/1/41/4)/(1/1000/1/41/4)1/3 = 1.6. The rate of heat transfer by convection is given by q = hAcpT, where A is the area, c is the specific heat capacity, and T is the temperature. So we have that q = (1.6)(2)(1000)(1000) = 64,000 Btu/hr. The local friction coefficient is given by f = 64/Re, where Re is the Reynolds number. So we have that f = 64/((20)(2000)/(0.0017)) = 0.0017. The local drag due to friction is given by fv2/2, where v is the velocity.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. The spinal cord is the main pathway for information connecting the brain and the rest of the body. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and by meninges. The spinal cord is divided into segments, each of which is associated with a pair of spinal nerves. The spinal cord is divided into three regions: the cervical region, the thoracic region, and the lumbar region. The cervical region is the uppermost region of the spinal cord, and it is located in the neck. The thoracic region is the middle region of the spinal cord, and it is located in the chest. The lumbar region is the lowermost region of the spinal cord, and it is located in the lower back. The spinal cord is divided into segments, each of which is associated with a pair of spinal nerves.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on double jeopardy for help. The defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on double jeopardy for help. The defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute.

The action is constitutional because the rule is rationally related to the department's purpose. Wealth is a quasi-suspect class, so the rule must promulgate an important governmental purpose. Eliminating poverty is important, so the rule meets this level of scrutiny. The employees would likely prevail because the rule is not narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. The action is arbitrary and capricious, so it is unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny standard. The rule is valid because the department has a legitimate interest in ensuring its employees understand the plight of the poor.

 The concentration of salt in the tank is
\[c(t) = \frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right) \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{gal}.\]
The rate of change of the concentration is
\[c'(t) = \frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right) \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{gal} \cdot 2 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min} = \frac{1}{2} \sin t \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{gal}.\]
The rate of change of the concentration is the same as the rate of change of the volume of the solution, hence the volume of the solution is
\[V(t) = \frac{1}{2} \sin t \mathrm{oz} / \mathrm{gal} \cdot 2 \mathrm{gal} / \mathrm{min} = \frac{1}{2} \sin t \mathrm{gal}.\]
The volume of the solution is the sum of the volumes of the water and the salt, hence

 The cumulative distribution function of the standard gaussian distribution is $F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} dt$. We need to compute the second derivative of $F(x)$ and check if it is positive. The second derivative is
\[F''(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} t dt.\]
We can compute the integral by parts. Let $u = e^{-t^2/2}$ and $v = t$. Then $du = -t e^{-t^2/2} dt$ and $dv = dt$. Hence
\[F''(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} t dt = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \left[ -e^{-t^2/2} t \right]_{-\infty}^x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \left[ -e^{-x^2/2} x -

and we can rewrite it as
\[sin(4x) = 54 - x.\]
We can use the newton-raphson method to find the roots of the equation $sin(4x) = 54 - x$. The first approximation is $x_0 = 54$. The second approximation is $x_1 = 54 - sin(4x_0) = 54 - sin(4\cdot 54) = 54 - 228.36 = 174.36$. The third approximation is $x_2 = 54 - sin(4x_1) = 54 - sin(4\cdot 174.36) = 54 - 73.24 = 81.26$. The fourth approximation is $x_3 = 54 - sin(4x_2) = 54 - sin(4\cdot 81.26) = 54 - 78.44 = 75.56$. The fifth approximation is

 The Midpoint Rule is a numerical method for approximating the integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$ by the sum of $f(x)$ over the points $x_i = a + (b-a)/n$ for $i = 0,1,2,\ldots,n$. In our case $n = 10$ and $x_i = 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} + (15 \mathrm{~cm} - 1.5 \mathrm{~cm})/10 = 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} + 13.5 \mathrm{~cm}/10 = 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} + 1.35 \mathrm{~cm} = 2.85 \mathrm{~cm}$.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We are given the following argument:
(1) L ⊃ [(M ∨ ~N) ⊃ O]
(2) (N ⊃ O) ⊃ (~P ⊃ Q)
(3) R ⊃ ~Q / L ⊃ (R ⊃ P)

We can use indirect truth tables to determine whether the argument is valid.

We can use the following truth table to determine whether the argument is valid:

 The angular retardation is the rate of change of angular velocity, or $\frac{d\omega}{dt}$. The angular velocity is $\omega = \frac{v}{r}$, where $v$ is the linear velocity and $r$ is the radius of the grindstone.

 The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature. Since the pressure is constant, we can ignore it, and we can also ignore $n$ since it is constant. Thus, the ideal gas law becomes $V = nRT/P$. Since the volume is 1200 cm^3, the number of moles of gas is 1200 cm^3/0.0821 L/mol = 14.6 moles. The universal gas constant is 0.0821 L/mol/K.

 The deflection is given by
\begin{equation}
\delta = \frac{n_1 \sin \gamma_1 - n_2 \sin \gamma_2}{n_1 \cos \gamma_1 + n_2 \cos \gamma_2}
\end{equation}
For direct vision, we want $\delta = 0$, so we set the numerator equal to zero and solve for $\gamma_2$:
\begin{equation}
\gamma_2 = \arcsin \left( \frac{n_1 \sin \gamma_1}{n_1 \cos \gamma_1 + n_2 \cos \gamma_2} \right)
