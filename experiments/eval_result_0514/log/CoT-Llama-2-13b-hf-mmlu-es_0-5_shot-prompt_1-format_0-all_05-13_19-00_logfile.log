 According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{rac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400.

 Enzymes do not raise the temperature of the reaction mixture, which rules out (A). Enzymes do not alter the equilibrium constant of a reaction, which rules out (B). Enzymes do not increase the maximal rate of the chemical reaction, which rules out (C). Enzymes do lower the activation energy, which is the energy required to initiate a chemical reaction, which is the correct answer (D).

 The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions in which a species can survive and reproduce. The realistic niche is the set of environmental conditions in which a species actually survives and reproduces.

 The partial pressure gradient of a gas is the difference in partial pressure between the alveoli and the blood. The partial pressure of a gas is the pressure of the gas in a given volume of gas, and is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas in the volume.

 The surface-to-volume ratio is the ratio of the surface area of a cell to its volume. The smaller the cell, the larger the surface-to-volume ratio. This is because the surface area of a cell is proportional to the square of its radius, while the volume is proportional to the cube of its radius. This means that the surface area of a cell increases much faster than its volume as the cell gets smaller. This is answer (B).
