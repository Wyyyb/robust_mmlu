 The cardiac cycle is the sequence of events that occur during each heartbeat. The cardiac cycle is divided into two phases: the diastolic phase and the systolic phase. During the diastolic phase, the ventricles relax and fill with blood. During the systolic phase, the ventricles contract and pump blood out of the heart. The volume of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat is called the stroke volume. The stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. The stroke volume is equal to the volume of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat. The stroke volume is equal to the volume of blood pumped out of the heart during each heartbeat.

We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$.
