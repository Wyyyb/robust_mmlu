Suppose you want to use the thresholding technique to segment the image. What is the appropriate threshold value based on the histogram of the image? Follow the following rule when you do thresholding or grouping: pixel $(i, j) \in$ Group A pixels if $g(i, j) \leq$ current threshold $\mathrm{T}$; pixel $(i, j) \in$ Group B pixels otherwise, where $g(i, j)$ is the intensity value of pixel $(i, j)$.",3,4,5,6,B
