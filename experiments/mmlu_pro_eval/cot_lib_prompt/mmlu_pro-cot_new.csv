college_mathematics,math,"A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?",3 + e^-2,2 - e^-4,2 - e^-2,3 + e^-4,2 + e^-3,2 - e^-3,3 - e^-2,2 + e^-2,2 + e^-4,2,I,2 + e^-4,"A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
rac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=rac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=rac{-1}{25}=rac{d}{d t}\left[-rac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$. The answer is (D)."

college_computer_science,computer science,"Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",1/50,2/50,2/30,1月27日,1月20日,1月30日,2月27日,1月25日,1月22日,2月25日,D,1月27日,"A: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.
Thus a given processor has:
(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =
(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:
misses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.
Next, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:
50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:
instructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.
Now, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:
lock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.
Thus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:
lock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =
(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B)."

We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let__ solve this problem step by step. First of all, let__ recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike__ criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let__ calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:
(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369
(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040
(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724
(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011
Because the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In this case, (D) has the lowest value. The answer is (C)."

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the r茅gime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.

You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.

The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

""The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.

professional_law,law,"On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely","grant relief, because the fence obstructs the use of the land by public utility companies.","grant relief, because the fence is considered a structure according to the original plan.","deny relief, because the original plan restrictions do not apply to fences.","deny relief, because the teacher has no legal standing to enforce the restriction.","deny relief, because the fence would not be construed as ""a structure"" within the terms of the restriction.","grant relief, because the librarian had not sought permission to build the fence.","deny relief, because the teacher failed to enforce the restriction against the retiree.","grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan.","grant relief, because the fence was in violation of the easement restriction.","deny relief, because the librarian had the right to build the fence on his property.",H,"grant relief, because the encroachment of the fence violated the restriction in the original plan.",A: Let's think step by step.

A student at a state university organized a demonstration on campus to protest the war. The rally was attended by a group of 50 students who shouted anti-war messages at cars passing by. To show his contempt for the United States, the student sewed the American flag to the rear of his jeans. When a police officer saw the flag sown on the student's jeans, he approached and told him to remove the flag or he would be placed under arrest. The student became angered and shouted at the police officer, ""Listen, you bastard, I'll wear this rag anywhere I please. "" The student was subsequently placed under arrest and charged with violating the state statute. The student subsequently brings suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the statute.
