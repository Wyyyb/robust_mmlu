abstract_algebra,abstract_algebra,Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.,0,1,2,3,B,1,"A: Let's think step by step. Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if x^2 + c does not have roots in Z_3. That is x^2 + c != 0 for every x in Z_3. If c = 0, then x^2 + c = x^2 has root 0. If c = 1 then x^2 + c = x^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 for x = 0, 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 1 and 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 2, hence x^2 + 1 does not have any roots. For c = 2 the polynomial x^2 + 2 has two roots at x = 1 and x = 2. Hence Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if c = 1. The answer is (B)."

anatomy,anatomy,The pleura,have no sensory innervation.,are separated by a 2 mm space.,extend into the neck.,are composed of respiratory epithelium.,C,extend into the neck.,"A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on anatomy for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First, recall that the pleura refers to the thin layer of tissue that covers the lungs and lines the interior wall of the chest cavity. Now, let’s look at each option:
Option (A): “The pleura have no sensory innervation.” This information is not correct. The pleura do have a sensory innervation.
Option (B): “The pleura are separated by a 2 mm space.” This information is not correct. There is a very thin “potential” space between the layers of the pleura; however, it is typically filled with serous pleural fluid. 
Option (C): “The pleura extend into the neck.” This information is actuakky true. The cervical pleura, also known as the dome of the pleuradome of the pleura, lines the extendsiton of the pleural cavity into the neck.
Option (D): “The pleura are composed of respiratory epithelium.” This information is not correct. The pleaura are composed of connective tissue (CT).
Because (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect, (D) is the only correct answer. The answer is (C)."

The asteroid belt is a stellar disc consisting of a large number of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter's orbits. The asteroids in this belt are affected by the gravitational pull from both other asteroids and nearby planets. Due to the strong gravitational force of Jupiter there are resonances that give rise to low density regions of asteroids known as the Kirkwood gap. So (B) and (C) are not correct since it’s not a lack of material that prevents a planet from being formed, and (A) is incorrect because the Kirkwood gap would have prevented a planet from forming in the first place, and (D) is the correct option. The answer is (D)."
astronomy,astronomy,Why is Mars red?,Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized ("rusted") minerals.,Because the atmosphere scatters more light at bluer wavelengths transmitting mostly red light.,Because Mars is covered with ancient lava flows which are red in color.,Because flowing water on Mars's surface altered the surface minerals several billion years ago.,A,Because the surface is covered with heavily oxidized ("rusted") minerals.,"A: Let's think step by step. Option (B) is not correct because if the red color was caused by the scattering off the atmosphere, then the earth with a much thicker atmosphere would also look red. Options (C) and (D) are not specific enough about why the color of the surface would be red, while (A) is correct because it explains that the surface is red due to the rusted materials on the surface and the red color comes from the rust. So the correct option is (A). The answer is (A)."

An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2.

First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5

We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.
Thus a given processor has:
(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =
(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:
misses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.
Next, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:
50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:
instructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.
Now, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:
lock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.
Thus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:
lock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =
(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B)."

For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]

Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$.

A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?",2,2 - e^-2,2 + e^-2,2 + e^-4,D,2 + e^-4,"A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$

Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$.

econometrics,econometrics,"Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?",1 lag,2 lags,3 lags,4 lags,C,3 lags,"A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let’s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike’s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let’s calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:
(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369
(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040
(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724
(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011
Because the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In this case, (D) has the lowest value. The answer is (C)."

A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups. The structure of PCL4F is that Phosphorus is the central atom, attached to four chlorines and one fluorine atom.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

Our leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, ""A plague on both your houses."" … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.

""Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure.""

""Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.""

Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.""
