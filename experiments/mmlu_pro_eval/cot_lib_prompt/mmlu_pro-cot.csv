However $HK$ contains cycles (1,2), (1,3) and (2,3,1), but the inverse of (2,3,1) is (2,1,3) and it does not belong to HK, hence HK is not a subgroup. The answer is (B)."
abstract_algebra,math,Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.,4,-2,5,2,0,3,-1,6,1,-3,I,1,"A: Let's think step by step. Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if x^2 + c does not have roots in Z_3. That is x^2 + c != 0 for every x in Z_3. If c = 0, then x^2 + c = x^2 has root 0. If c = 1 then x^2 + c = x^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 for x = 0, 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 1 and 1 + 1 = 2 for x = 2, hence x^2 + 1 does not have any roots. For c = 2 the polynomial x^2 + 2 has two roots at x = 1 and x = 2. Hence Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field if and only if c = 1. The answer is (B)."

If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?",3 + e^-2,2 - e^-4,2 - e^-2,3 + e^-4,2 + e^-3,2 - e^-3,3 - e^-2,2 + e^-2,2 + e^-4,2,I,2 + e^-4,"A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$.

Peptidoglycan is known to comprise the plasma membrane of most bacteria, rather than the exoskeleton of arthropods, which is made of chitin, which rules out (A). The answer (C) is false because arthropods are a highly successful phylum. Likewise, arthropods have paired, jointed appendages, which rules out (D). The only remaining option is (B), as arthropods have an open circulatory system with a dorsal tubular heart. The answer is (B)."
college_biology,biology,"In a given population, 1 out of every 400 people has a cancer caused by a completely recessive allele, b. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which of the following is the expected proportion of individuals who carry the b allele but are not expected to develop the cancer?",19/400,1/400,40/400,38/400,2/400,1/200,20/400,50/400,39/400,37/400,D,38/400,"A: Let's think step by step. According to the Hardy Weinberg Law, $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, and $p + q = 1$ where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{rac{1}{400}} = 0.05$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.95$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.05 \cdot 0.95 = 0.095$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.095 * 400 = 38$. So we end up with 38/400. The answer is (D)."

The genetic material in Telomeres is not used, which rules out (A). Nucleosomes are the repeating subunit that comprises chromatin packed in a cell nucleus, and do not specifically refer to DNA sequences necessary for segregating chromosomes in cell division, which rules out (C). A spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNA rather than governing chromosome segregation. Centromeres are directly responsible for segregating chromosomes in cell division. The answer is (B)."
college_biology,biology,"The presence of homologous structures in two different organisms, such as the humerus in the front limb of a human and a bird, indicates that",the human and bird developed by analogy,a human's and bird's evolution is convergent,the human and bird have the same number of chromosomes,the human and bird belong to different phyla,the human and bird have evolved independently of each other,the human and bird live in the same geographical region,the human and bird share a common ancestor,the human and bird belong to a clade,the human and bird have similar diets,the human and bird are polyphyletic species,H,the human and bird belong to a clade,"A: Let's think step by step. Polyphyletic species are organisms that are grouped due to having similar characteristics but which do not have a common ancestor. This is not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (A). Convergent evolution refers to the indepdendent development of similar features in different species at different periods, which is also not the case for humans and birds, which rules out (B). Analogy refers to the superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins, which is not the case for the human and bird forearms, which rules out (D). Humans and birds do belong to the same clade - a group of organisms composed of a common ancestor. The answer is (C)."

A change in an amino acid leads to a change in the primary structure of the protein. A change in the primary structure may lead to a change in the secondary and the tertiary structure of the protein. A change in the tertiary structure means a change in the shape of the protein, so (C) has to be correct. Since the change does not affect the active site of the enzyme, we do not expect the activity of the enzyme to be affected. The answer is (C)."

A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C).

A polar molecule is one that has a slightly positive charge on one end of the molecule and a slightly negative charge on the other end. Boron trifluoride (BF3) has Boron as the center atom and three fluorine atoms attached to it; it is trigonal planar and symmetric, so it is nonpolar. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has Carbon as the central atom with double bonds to two Oxygen atoms - this is also symmetrical and therefore nonpolar. The same is the case for tetramethyl silane (SI(CH3)4), which is a Silicon atom surrounded by four methyl groups.

Statement I is a correct statement about a Singleton, because a Singleton restricts instantiation to a single, static method. Statement II is also correct, because there is no inherent restriction regarding the inheritance of a Singleton.

ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd)
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd (Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd)
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence.
Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?",10,6,9,5,12,4,7,8,3,11,B,6,"A: Let's think step by step. First, we are given that A is in R0, B is in R1, and C is in R2.
Next, we can see that we must compute three multiplies (AB, BC, and ABC) and two adds (AB + ABC, (AB + ABC) + BC) to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:
compute AB: MUL R0, R1, R3
compute BC: MUL R1, R2, R4
compute ABC: MUL R3, R4, R5
compute AB + BC: ADD R3, R4, R6

college_computer_science,computer science,"Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",1/50,2/50,2/30,1/27,1/20,1/30,2/27,1/25,1/22,2/25,D,1/27,"A: Let's think step by step. We know that each instruction requires two memory references per instruction, and that there is an average cache miss rate of one percent.
Thus a given processor has:
(1 cache miss / 100 references) * (2 references / instruction) =
(2 cache misses / 100 instructions), so:
misses_per_instruction = 1 cache miss / 50 instructions.
Next, we know that each instruction requires 500 nanoseconds when there is no cache miss, and 500 + 2000 = 2500 nanoseconds when there is a cache miss. Thus:
50 instructions / (49 * 500) + (1 * 2500) nanoseconds, so:
instructions_per_ns = 50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds.
Now, we know that each cache miss locks the bus for half of the 2000 nanosecond cache miss delay, or 1000 nanoseconds, so:
lock_ns_per_miss = 1000 nanoseconds / cache miss.
Thus we can see that on average a single processor will lock the bus for:
lock_ns_per_miss * misses_per_instruction * instructions_per_ns =
(1000 nanoseconds / cache miss) * (1 cache miss / 50 instructions) * (50 instructions / 27000 nanoseconds) = 1000 * (1/50) * (50/27000) = 1000/27000 = 1/27. The answer is (B)."

econometrics,economics,"Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?",6 lags,4 lags,2 lags,9 lags,1 lag,5 lags,No lags,3 lags,7 lags,8 lags,H,3 lags,"A: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let’s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike’s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let’s calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:
(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369
(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040
(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724
(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011
Because the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In this case, (D) has the lowest value. The answer is (C)."

Let’s solve this problem step by step. If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:
unconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)
We know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:
unconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33. That means that the answer should be (D) 0.33. The answer is (D)."

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.

The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.

professional_law,law,"On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed.
