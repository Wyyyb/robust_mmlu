"A biochemist performed several experiments on rats. In one, heused two groups of young rats. GroupArats were fed on adiet of purified casein (cheese protein), starch, glucose, lard, minerals, and water. Group B rats were fed the same dietwith the addition of 3 cm^3 of milk daily. It was observed thatGroup A rats stopped growing and lost weight, while Group B rats gained steadily in weight and size. After eighteendays the milk was given to Group A rats and removedfrom the diet of Group B. Group A rats now resumedgrowth and gained in weight, while Group B rats stoppedgrowing and lost weight.
