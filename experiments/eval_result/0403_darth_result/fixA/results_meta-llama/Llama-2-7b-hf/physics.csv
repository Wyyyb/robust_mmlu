There are several warning signs. When the centripetal acceleration is $2 g$ or $3 g$, the pilot feels heavy. At about $4 g$, the pilot's vision switches to black and white and narrows to ""tunnel vision."" If that acceleration is sustained or increased, vision ceases and, soon after, the pilot is unconscious - a condition known as $g$-LOC for "" $g$-induced loss of consciousness.""
