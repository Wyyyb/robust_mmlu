Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is determined for all of the subjects.

"As part of the Women’s Health Study, researchers investigated the role of systemic inflammation in predicting cardiovascular disease in women (N Engl J Med. 2002;347[20]:1557-1565). Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:",Women with the highest CRP levels were least likely to have a heart attack/stroke.,"All women in the study had the same risk of heart attack/stroke, regardless of CRP level.",There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to decrease the risk of heart attack/stroke.,The risk of heart attack/stroke is highest in the first quintile.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Women in the third quintile had the lowest risk of heart attack/stroke.,CRP level has no impact on the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,C,False,0.0020672209,0.0013982994,0.000809543,0.9887445,0.0030232805,0.0005361326,0.00032279736,0.00046833188,0.00020105374,0.0024287323
