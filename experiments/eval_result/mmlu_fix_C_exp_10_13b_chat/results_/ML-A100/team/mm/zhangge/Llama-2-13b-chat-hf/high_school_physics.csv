Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit?",The satellite now orbits in a circle of the same radius.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.","The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.,The satellite now orbits in an elliptical path with P as the midpoint of the minor axis.,The satellite now orbits in a hyperbolic path.,The satellite now orbits in a parabolic path.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the midpoint of the major axis.","The satellite now orbits in a spiral, gradually moving away from Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.,C,False,0.0013384557,0.67563367,0.048491426,0.004718847,0.2640959,0.0019232268,0.0010108805,0.0014944475,0.0005013593,0.0007917634
