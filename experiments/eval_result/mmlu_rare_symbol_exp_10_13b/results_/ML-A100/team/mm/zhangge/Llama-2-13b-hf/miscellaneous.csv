"A passage Jane Eyre is as follows. This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes, a gentleman, a landed proprietor‚Äìnothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity. Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker in that Mrs. Fairfax",has a more critical view of people's character,has a more simplistic view of people's identities,is more willing to take people at face value,is less skeptical about people's intentions,has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester,has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities,is more reserved in her observations,is less interested in understanding people's true nature,judges people by their social station in life,is less curious about people's personal life,C,True,0.013598467,0.38470867,0.43593204,0.05629583,0.02336773,0.0077527775,0.0062523303,0.050190043,0.0070376396,0.014864394

"A passage from Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God is as follows. The people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.
