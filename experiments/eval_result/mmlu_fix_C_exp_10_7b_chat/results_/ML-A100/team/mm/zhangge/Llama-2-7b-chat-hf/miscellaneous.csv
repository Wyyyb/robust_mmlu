"From the very beginning, I wrote to explain my own life to myself, and I invited any readers who chose to make the journey with me to join me on the high wire.

I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",The author explains the importance of storytelling in understanding the world.,The author narrates a series of events without providing any interpretation.,The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.,The author describes a sequence of events leading to his current work.,The author contrasts his methods of work with others in his profession.,The author discusses the impact of his profession on his personal life.,The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.,The author uses his personal experiences to critique societal norms.,The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.,The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.,C,True,0.018280206,0.04521108,0.74512506,0.022647392,0.020224351,0.005383302,0.016651718,0.051565655,0.074302,0.0006093437
