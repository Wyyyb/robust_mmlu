The drug, which is tasteless, is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice. Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is determined for all of the subjects.

"As part of the Women’s Health Study, researchers investigated the role of systemic inflammation in predicting cardiovascular disease in women (N Engl J Med. 2002;347[20]:1557-1565). Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:",Women with the highest CRP levels were least likely to have a heart attack/stroke.,"All women in the study had the same risk of heart attack/stroke, regardless of CRP level.",There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to decrease the risk of heart attack/stroke.,The risk of heart attack/stroke is highest in the first quintile.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Women in the third quintile had the lowest risk of heart attack/stroke.,CRP level has no impact on the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,C,False,0.05036127,0.06010349,0.14758812,0.42918754,0.12139455,0.04443832,0.009765696,0.10154045,0.034667004,0.0009536176
