Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit?",The satellite now orbits in a circle of the same radius.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a parabolic path.,The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.,The satellite now orbits in an elliptical path with P as the midpoint of the minor axis.,The satellite now orbits in a hyperbolic path.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.","The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the midpoint of the major axis.","The satellite now orbits in a spiral, gradually moving away from Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.,G,False,0.053790133,0.44193256,0.08894489,0.37473008,0.0260827,0.00925815,0.0011003613,0.0015759552,0.0020361384,0.0005491849
