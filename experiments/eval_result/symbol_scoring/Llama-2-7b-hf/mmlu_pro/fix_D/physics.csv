"""Top gun"" pilots have long worried about taking a turn too tightly. As a pilot's body undergoes centripetal acceleration, with the head toward the center of curvature, the blood pressure in the brain decreases, leading to loss of brain function.

At about $4 g$, the pilot's vision switches to black and white and narrows to ""tunnel vision.""
