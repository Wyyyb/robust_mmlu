"A biochemist performed several experiments on rats. In one, heused two groups of young rats. GroupArats were fed on adiet of purified casein (cheese protein), starch, glucose, lard, minerals, and water. Group B rats were fed the same dietwith the addition of 3 cm^3 of milk daily. It was observed thatGroup A rats stopped growing and lost weight, while Group B rats gained steadily in weight and size. After eighteendays the milk was given to Group A rats and removedfrom the diet of Group B. Group A rats now resumedgrowth and gained in weight, while Group B rats stoppedgrowing and lost weight. The investigator knew that 3 cm^3 of milk has an insigni-ficantfood value in terms of carbohydrates, fats, proteinsand minerals. Consider yourself in his position, confrontedwith only the information given so far. a) What conclusions could you reach about the presencein milk of substances other than these four foods, thepossible functions of the hypothetical substances, and thequantities needed by the rats? b) Why was it necessary to transfer the milkfrom Group B rats to Group A rats half-way through the experiment? c) The rats received only one type of protein (casein) .
