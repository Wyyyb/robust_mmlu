How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?,"Weak state insecurity can be traced back to the lack of a common language and culture, which creates divisions and prevents the state from unifying.","The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.",The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.,"The origins of weak state insecurity lie in the state's inability to manage diversity and resolve conflicts between different ethnic, religious or social groups.",Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.,Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood.

How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?,"Men, being physically stronger, are naturally inclined to carry out physically demanding tasks for the state, while women, being more emotionally intelligent, are naturally inclined to handle tasks requiring sensitivity and empathy.","Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties.

What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat.

In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?,To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient.

"Since the end of the Cold War, how has the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers changed?","The hostile geopolitical environment has encouraged states to pursue military strategies in order to secure their interests. The use of violence rather than diplomacy or incentives has become the primary response to threats, whether these are posed by other states, resource scarcity, pandemic diseases, or other non-traditional threats.","The favourable geo-political environment, characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention, has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states.","The demise of the ideological bipolar division of international society in the Cold War, rather than resulting in a reduction of hostilities, has left an unstable legacy where a policy of force and mass retaliation continues to pose a very real threat.

How does Buzan's concept of 'societal security' mark a departure from traditional understandings of security?,Contemporary processes of globalization and societal conflict required the development of new conceptual tools beyond the state as the referent object. Security was dependent on factors beyond geographically conceived survival: survival of the state was superseded by survival of the nation (ethnic) state.,"The end of the Cold War allowed security studies to move beyond the confines of the dominant realist and neorealist perspectives, with an emerging interest in other, non-military, conceptions of security.

What are the effects of nuclear weapons?,"The detonation of a nuclear weapon causes a massive release of electromagnetic energy, but no physical destruction.",All of the above,The use of nuclear weapons results in an immediate and irreversible climate change.,The only effect of a nuclear weapon is the creation of a large mushroom cloud.,A nuclear detonation produces a shockwave resulting from a rise in atmospheric pressure and dynamic overpressure sufficient to destroy concrete structures. Blast effects were generally used by military planners to calculate casualty rates in a nuclear attack: It was estimated that 50 percent living in a five mile radius of a one-mgt airburst would be killed or wounded by blast effects.,"A nuclear blast produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), ""the Compton effect."" EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.",Nuclear weapons cause immediate blindness to anyone within a 100-mile radius of the detonation.,"Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect. Panic set off by even a limited dispersion of radioactive material might be more costly in terms of the disruption it causes than actual casualties or damage to property produced by a dirty bomb detonation; some observers believe that the blast itself causes the greatest amount of damage.","Nuclear weapons only cause damage through a massive explosion, with no other lasting effects.",Nuclear weapons cause a worldwide blackout due to the electromagnetic pulse.,B,True,0.00034747613,0.9677338,0.00083622953,0.0006428707,0.025601037,0.001561505,0.00033169528,0.0005780727,0.00054228207,0.001824766

An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.",Governments prevent terrorism by imposing strict border controls and immigration policies to limit the movement of potential threats.,Governments prevent terrorism by increasing military presence and patrols in areas believed to be at risk for attacks.,Governments prevent terrorism by promoting propaganda that denounces terrorist activities and emphasizes the negative consequences of such actions.,B,True,0.036611024,0.64392716,0.009444495,0.034984462,0.18857259,0.015225679,0.012330495,0.028375627,0.0119016385,0.018626697
In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?,The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.,"The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is based on the duration of the conflict. If the conflict is short-lived, it involves limited force, but if it's protracted, it involves full-scale force.","Limited force and full-scale force can be distinguished based on the coercer's ultimate goal. If the goal is to completely overpower the adversary, then full-scale force is employed, whereas if the goal is to negotiate terms, limited force is used.","Limited force and full-scale force can be distinguished based on the level of destruction caused. Full-scale force results in massive destruction, while limited force results in minimal damage.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is determined by the level of resistance encountered. If the resistance is high, then full-scale force is used, otherwise, limited force is sufficient.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is based on the size of the military involved. If the entire military is mobilized, it's full-scale force; if only a part of the military is involved, it's limited force.","Limited force and full-scale force can be differentiated based on their impact on civilian life. Full-scale force often results in high civilian casualties, while limited force tries to minimize civilian harm.","The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.",Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive. Military action always results from a failure of negotiations and from a shift from the diplomatic to the military sphere.,B,True,0.0050545693,0.9820271,0.0023624569,0.003076826,0.0017063818,0.0006578688,0.00036963326,0.0013697897,0.0012661334,0.0021093402

It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.,"The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.","The evolution of security studies will be dictated by economic forces, with political and environmental factors playing a secondary role.",The field of security studies will be completely transformed by the rise of cyber warfare and digital threats.,B,True,0.0003628903,0.98797613,0.00031687313,0.00069592096,0.0037105111,0.00035441166,0.00012557345,0.0008900871,0.0012761977,0.0042914925

Why is coercive diplomacy hard? What are the inherent difficulties?,Coercive diplomacy is hard because the adversary is always aware of the end-goal and thus can plan strategies to evade or counteract it.,"The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.","The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play. Inducements can appear to look like concessionary politics and blur the line of what constitutes a success defined as the fear of inescapable escalation.","It can be hard because it often requires a significant amount of resources, which may not always be available.","Coercive diplomacy can be hard due to the difficulty of maintaining secrecy. The adversary, being aware of the coercive efforts, may take steps to counteract them.",Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.,"Coercive diplomacy can increase the risk of backlash from the international community, making it difficult to sustain over a long period of time.","Coercive diplomacy is often seen as a last resort, making it difficult to utilize effectively in the early stages of conflict.","The approach of coercive diplomacy is inherently aggressive, which can cause the adversary to become defensive and less likely to cooperate.","Perpetual, psychological and emotional factors are precluded from the adversary's calculations. In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time.",B,True,0.00090171676,0.8455886,0.005729729,0.0015295219,0.0005846006,0.0016059563,0.000446183,0.0011384634,0.0011044757,0.14137082
