What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat.

In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?,To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it.

In what ways have feminist and critical security investigations of the 1980s and 1990s expanded our understanding of gender security issues?,"Gendered consequences of security issues have not challenged international relations theory. Constructivist theories of the state were mainstreamed without undermining the ideas of state as the centre of military power, or as the highest organization of human community.","Feminist and critical security theory shows us that war can have gendered consequences. Recognition of those consequences has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare, and has shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles.","Investigations in the 1980s and 1990s failed to address the gendered consequences of war, focusing instead on economic and political implications.","They introduced the concept of women as active participants in conflict, without significantly expanding our understanding of broader gender security issues.","The investigations led to the development of gender-neutral policies in security and defense, eliminating the need for further study of gender security issues.","These investigations primarily focused on the impact of war on children, leaving the gendered consequences largely unexplored.","The literature that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s was primarily concerned with the ways in which women had served the purposes of nationalist campaigns, focusing on the biological characteristics of women as sexually reproductive beings, and with little focus on critical analysis.",These investigations demonstrated that gender security issues are not relevant to the study of international relations and security studies.,Investigations into the consequences of state security policies showed that women were subject to masculine dominated war policies as the likely victims as casualties of war or as post conflict targets.

What preventative security measures might a government take in defence of a potential future terrorist attack?,"Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.",Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).,"Prevention is focused on negotiating with terrorist organizations, seeking to reach agreements to halt violence.",Prevention measures include public education campaigns about the dangers of terrorism and instructions on what to do in the event of an attack.,"Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments. Protecting possible targets of the state enhances the wellbeing of more vulnerable targets. Terrorists may move to more convenient territory to target their objectives which make it more difficult to control.","Prevention is primarily achieved through mass surveillance, with the government monitoring all citizen activities and communications for signs of potential threats.","Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure. In both the warfare and criminal model, intelligence is obtained by two methods; firstly to elicit information from captured terrorists or secondly from an informer within the group. An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.",Governments prevent terrorism by imposing strict border controls and immigration policies to limit the movement of potential threats.,Governments prevent terrorism by increasing military presence and patrols in areas believed to be at risk for attacks.,Governments prevent terrorism by promoting propaganda that denounces terrorist activities and emphasizes the negative consequences of such actions.,B,True,0.18640088,0.18650436,0.11116035,0.1396086,0.18350784,0.07678836,0.046025388,0.052488107,0.012227447,0.005288593
In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?,The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.,"The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is based on the duration of the conflict. If the conflict is short-lived, it involves limited force, but if it's protracted, it involves full-scale force.","Limited force and full-scale force can be distinguished based on the coercer's ultimate goal. If the goal is to completely overpower the adversary, then full-scale force is employed, whereas if the goal is to negotiate terms, limited force is used.","Limited force and full-scale force can be distinguished based on the level of destruction caused. Full-scale force results in massive destruction, while limited force results in minimal damage.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is determined by the level of resistance encountered. If the resistance is high, then full-scale force is used, otherwise, limited force is sufficient.","The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is based on the size of the military involved. If the entire military is mobilized, it's full-scale force; if only a part of the military is involved, it's limited force.","Limited force and full-scale force can be differentiated based on their impact on civilian life. Full-scale force often results in high civilian casualties, while limited force tries to minimize civilian harm.","The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.",Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible. Resort to air or sea power constitutes an equal coercive capacity to a conventional ground offensive.

Why is coercive diplomacy hard? What are the inherent difficulties?,Coercive diplomacy is hard because the adversary is always aware of the end-goal and thus can plan strategies to evade or counteract it.,"The success ultimately rests on perceptual, psychological and emotional factors, giving rise to the risk that misperception or miscalculation will defeat even a well-executed strategy that otherwise meets all the requirements for success.","The political scope for offering inducements can become unlimited. The problem becomes particularly underlined when the risk of terrorism, WMD or equal military capability comes into play. Inducements can appear to look like concessionary politics and blur the line of what constitutes a success defined as the fear of inescapable escalation.","It can be hard because it often requires a significant amount of resources, which may not always be available.","Coercive diplomacy can be hard due to the difficulty of maintaining secrecy. The adversary, being aware of the coercive efforts, may take steps to counteract them.",Coercive diplomacy leaves too much room for compromise. Actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive their vital interests as threatened and regard issues as zero-sum because they are aware that force will be used. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.,"Coercive diplomacy can increase the risk of backlash from the international community, making it difficult to sustain over a long period of time.","Coercive diplomacy is often seen as a last resort, making it difficult to utilize effectively in the early stages of conflict.","The approach of coercive diplomacy is inherently aggressive, which can cause the adversary to become defensive and less likely to cooperate.","Perpetual, psychological and emotional factors are precluded from the adversary's calculations.
