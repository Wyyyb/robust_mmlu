Researchers used a prospective study design with a large sample size. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured at baseline and women were followed for an average of 8 years. The following table shows the relative risk estimates of cardiovascular event (heart attack or stroke) within 5 years by quintile of CRP level for the 30,000 women. The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:",Women with the highest CRP levels were least likely to have a heart attack/stroke.,"All women in the study had the same risk of heart attack/stroke, regardless of CRP level.",There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to decrease the risk of heart attack/stroke.,The risk of heart attack/stroke is highest in the first quintile.,There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Women in the third quintile had the lowest risk of heart attack/stroke.,CRP level has no impact on the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,C,False,0.0057342444,0.0055516595,0.005399775,0.9619818,0.010692698,0.001205655,0.00082180667,0.00227046,0.001629331,0.0047126613

Why are the viruses of this family called astroviruses?,"Because they were named after the Greek word for star, ""asteri""",Because of their ability to survive in extreme conditions like space,The superficial appearance of a 'star' on negative straining electron microscopy,Because they were discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope,"Because of isolation in very large numbers of mammals including dromedaries, cats and cattle",Because they cause symptoms similar to those experienced in space travel,Because they are more common in developing countries with poor hygiene,Because of the nucleotide sequence of their genomes,Because they were first discovered in the asteroid belt,Because they are responsible for the 'starry sky' pattern seen in infected cells,C,True,0.00848103,0.009787343,0.8868832,0.026615417,0.031211914,0.005624522,0.0066272807,0.006882599,0.008734673,0.009151981
