The first quintile is used as the reference category.  1 0.49 mg/dL Relative Risk Number of women  1.0 6000  2 >0.49-1.08 mg/dL 1.8 6000  Quintile of CRP Level 3 >1.08-2.09 mg/dL 2.3 6000  4 >2.09-4.19 mg/dL 3.2 6000  5 >4.19 mg/dL 4.5 6000  Based on the relative risk data above, one can conclude:",Women with the highest CRP levels were least likely to have a heart attack/stroke.,There is no risk of heart attack/stroke for women with CRP levels in the first quintile.,The risk of heart attack/stroke is highest in the first quintile.,Decreasing CRP level appears to decrease the risk of heart attack/stroke.,"All women in the study had the same risk of heart attack/stroke, regardless of CRP level.",There appears to be no association between CRP levels and heart attack/stroke.,Decreasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Women in the third quintile had the lowest risk of heart attack/stroke.,CRP level has no impact on the risk of heart attack/stroke.,Increasing CRP level appears to increase the risk of heart attack/stroke.,B,False,0.018527882,0.01827131,0.023506468,0.85804886,0.03455128,0.0073295366,0.0062333955,0.009046507,0.006389656,0.018095145
