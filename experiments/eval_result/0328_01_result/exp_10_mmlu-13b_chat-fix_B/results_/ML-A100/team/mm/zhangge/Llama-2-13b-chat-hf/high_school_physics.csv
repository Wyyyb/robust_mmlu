Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit?",The satellite now orbits in a circle of the same radius.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a parabolic path.,The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.,The satellite now orbits in an elliptical path with P as the midpoint of the minor axis.,The satellite now orbits in a hyperbolic path.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.","The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the midpoint of the major axis.","The satellite now orbits in a spiral, gradually moving away from Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.,B,True,0.0007241159,0.90925497,0.0034267518,0.0020670246,0.07967076,0.0009410114,0.00041549932,0.001046843,0.000907161,0.0015458254
