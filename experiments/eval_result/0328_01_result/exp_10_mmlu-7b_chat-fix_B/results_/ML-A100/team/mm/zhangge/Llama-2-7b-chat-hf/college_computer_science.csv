A major advantage of direct mapping of a cache is its simplicity. The main disadvantage of this organization is that,it cannot store large amounts of data,the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache,it is more expensive than other types of cache organizations,its access time is less than that of other cache organizations,it does not allow simultaneous access to the intended data and its tag,its access time is greater than that of other cache organizations,the cache miss ratio is improved if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache,it is not compatible with all types of processors,it requires more power than other cache organizations,it allows simultaneous access to the intended data and its tag,B,True,0.0050260657,0.949622,0.0082151815,0.0089530805,0.0072503425,0.0031987983,0.010857596,0.0068537323,1.7721841e-06,2.1473052e-05

"A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored.
