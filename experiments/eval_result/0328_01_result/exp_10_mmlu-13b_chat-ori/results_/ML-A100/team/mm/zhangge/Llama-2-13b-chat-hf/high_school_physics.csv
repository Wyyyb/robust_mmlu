Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit?",The satellite now orbits in a circle of the same radius.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a parabolic path.,The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.,The satellite now orbits in an elliptical path with P as the midpoint of the minor axis.,The satellite now orbits in a hyperbolic path.,"The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.","The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the midpoint of the major axis.","The satellite now orbits in a spiral, gradually moving away from Earth.",The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.,G,False,0.0015102219,0.15716815,0.0052490695,0.006024893,0.7917972,0.0043593496,0.0053704483,0.02055933,0.0019801706,0.0059809894
