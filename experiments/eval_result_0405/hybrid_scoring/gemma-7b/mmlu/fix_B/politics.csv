In what ways have governments responded to the threat of TNC post-Cold War?,State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.,"With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.",The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.,The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.,B,ori_mmlu-security_studies,False,0.25007233023643494,0.25039589405059814,0.24853515625,0.2509966790676117

However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.","The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk.

How can the origins of weak state insecurity be explained?,Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.,"The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.",The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.,Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.,B,ori_mmlu-security_studies,True,0.24763576686382294,0.2540595531463623,0.24441947042942047,0.2538852393627167

How do biological differences affect the roles that men and women must perform for the state?,"Biology determines the female body as weak, ensuring that men continue to dominate state security apparatus in order to protect them. Women are aware of practical biological differences, and by accepting them they allow men to act as their protectors and care-givers. In return, women must act as protectors and care-givers to those less capable than themselves, their children, infants, the elderly, and the infirm.","Gender roles are a social construct; the values that we attribute to masculinity or femininity, such as strength or care-giving, are the product of shared social ideals rather than innate biological properties. Men and women are equally able to care effectively for children or to conduct violent and aggressive behaviour. However, social constructs of gender roles are pervasive, and women are likely to be victims of gender-based violence in conflict whilst men are more likely to be involved as perpetrators of violence.","Indiscriminate warfare is gender neutral and in contemporary conflicts there is no gender difference in levels of risk or duty. Men are just as likely to become victims of mass rape (as in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Balkans conflict) as women, and women are equally likely to be conscripted or coerced into military service.","The most intimate of human activities for women are more important than the demands of the political and religious male dominated elite.

Human migration will lead to overcrowding and resource scarcity but this will be addressed by the technological advancements of developing states to which most migration will take place.,"Human migration will arise as a result of global inequalities in the distribution of power, wealth, and resources. Disempowerment of populations will lead to competition and violence, manifested in transnational movements; and environmental threats and resources scarcity will lead to conflict.","The primary cause of conflict, both at international and sub-national level will be based in ideological differences between populations as resources scarcity, population growth and human migration forces diverse identity groups into increasingly close contact.","Environmental concerns will be overshadowed by immediate threats to international security, posed by global economic crisis and the subsequent rise of fundamentalist ideologies and violence.

Is the weak state security dilemma an inescapable condition?,The Global War on Terror has had a positive effect on the state-building project. The fight against terrorism has redirected international attention and resources towards eradicating insecurities as part of the recognition of the multilevel factors facilitating the emergence of terrorism. Specifically this involves the controlling of the proliferation of arms.,"The problems of weak state insecurity have taken a low priority on the international agenda and solutions have not moved beyond the context of liberal multi-party democracy and free market capitalism. The problem thus far is that no one case of enforced neo-liberalism, either through conditionalities, regime change, peace-building, has succeeded in transforming a weak state into a strong state.","The failure of liberal reform has highlighted the increasing viability of the option of alternative forms of political organization beyond the state. Sub-state organizations are a practical solution to dealing with regions with endemic problems of weapons and poverty, whilst regional organization is a sustainable structural form in Africa and Latin America.","Weak states have embarked on a protracted and difficult process to attain effective status.

What has been the impact of nuclear deterrence on international politics post-Cold War?,"There is a developing scholarly trend toward proliferation pessimism, a pattern which has gained momentum rather than subsided with the end of the Cold War. There is concern that accidental war may occur, either through misperception, psychological or technical problems that can lead to spiralling tensions which result in a failure of deterrence policy. In addition, normal accidents resulting from the inability of a state to capably anticipate human-machine interactions in the complexities of the international (and anarchical) system may also occur.","Despite the recognition that the ability to retaliate (the secure second-strike capability) produces a situation known as crisis stability, there is no consensus on the impact of nuclear capabilities, whether a source of stabilization or an existential threat. However there is agreement that the spread of WMD capacity to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Indeed whilst the possibility exists, states will have to heighten security efforts.","Proliferation optimists dispute the claim that nuclear technology leads to a propensity of the holding actor towards war. They do concede that there is the risk that terrorists acquiring the weapon could create an existential threat to the international system, although the threat is not yet a reality. Furthermore, the ability to retaliate can eliminate an opponent's potential gain.","Deterrence has proved to have been a source of stabilization during the Cold War but proliferation pessimists contend that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives.

In what ways does the Ideal Policy framework explain previous understandings of the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions?,In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.,All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.,Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.,To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it.

What is the relevance of behaviour in economic security analysis?,The growth of capitalism has catapulted the individual consumer to a place of extreme significance in shaping the global market.

What long-term trends can be foreseen in the concept of environmental security?,"In the post-9/11 reversion to traditional security thinking, environmental security as a concept is likely to enjoy continued attention from security analysts and policymakers.","The impact of environmental problems seems unlikely to diminish so that the relevance of environmental security for policy will likely increase, particularly multilateral action on common security concerns to achieve forms of social organization that are ecologically sustainable. In some sense, current practices of national security are an impediment to achieving environmental security for all people.","National security practices are the most effective means to achieving environmental security reforms to consolidate the socio-economic organizational base of the country against threat. The state on a practical level remains the most capable body - having the monopolization over the instruments of violence, and centralization of resources - to enter into trans-national agreements for the management of environmental constraints.",Increasing evidence of the negative effects of environmental insecurity may increasingly govern national security interests and behaviour.

What is meant by the term 'energy security nexus'?,The 'energy security nexus' refers to the constant state of flux between energy supplies and levels of security that can be achieved by states that rely on these supplies.,An 'energy security nexus' exists in the international system because the geographical distribution of energy supply and demand are not equal; thus states are drawn into complex and intertwined relationships with one another.,"An 'energy security nexus' exists where two states directly contend for access to the same, often limited, energy resource, such as oil reserves.",An 'energy security nexus' exists in the global system as a result of strategic planning by oil-rich states to ensure that the geographical distribution of supply and demand is not equal.,B,ori_mmlu-security_studies,True,0.24999022483825684,0.25231078267097473,0.24645522236824036,0.2512437701225281

This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.","Although there are fears posed by WMD proliferation that terrorists may gain the capacity to develop weapons, it would remain very difficult to construct even a primitive gun-type nuclear weapon.

What are the causes of terrorism?,"Democratization and nationalism inhibits the opportunity for terrorism: nationalism provides the ideological dynamic to unify ethnic differences, and democracy allows for the articulation of grievances in a constructive manner. Within this analysis states with weak democratic and nationalist credentials may provide the conditions that contribute to the development of terrorism.","Capitalist market activities and technological and communication revolutions have increasingly intruded on traditional cultures and societies. Development inequalities and increasing marginalization of some ethnic or economic groups in the populations, alongside an increasing awareness of their dispossession provides grounds for breeding terrorism.","Terrorism amongst Islamic groups is developed on ethnocentric lines opposed to the secularism that accompanies modernity.

There is a need to establish the nature and consequences of insecurity in the developing world. Why is this?,Empirically there is a need to understand why virtually all war and major political violence since 1945 continues to take place in the developing world and why the majority originates from internal rather than external sources.

Has TNC become a national security threat?,"Transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development. Organized crime is seen as a threat to development insofar as it undermines the rule of law and deters foreign investment by increasing the level of insecurity in the host communities.

However thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.",All of the above,"Nuclear reactions in the initial nuclear detonation or the fallout can cause radiation poisoning, as irradiated debris is picked up by the nuclear fireball and lofted into the atmosphere. A dirty bomb uses chemical high-explosive to disperse radioactive material, relying on radiation to produce a lethal effect.

What is the market vision of transnational organized crime?,Market place scholars argue that transnational crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.,"Market analysts claim that organized crime is highly disorganized, and resembles more a market for illicit goods and services than an organization. Proponents of this view minimize the threat posed by organized criminals to states and societies.",Market analysts believe that white-collar and corporate crimes contribute significantly to undermining the licit market. Those organized crime groups are more prone to use violence and corruption than ordinary criminal groups as a result of the extent of profits invested in their activities.,Market analysts argue that the criminal alliances create organizations with a high level of wealth and power that far underestimates what government and official estimates attribute to them.

To what extent have biological agents been weaponized?,"Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon. Resource requirements would be minimal as fermenters used to make vaccines could be converted for military production and relatively small quantities of the agent are required to produce highly lethal effects, making them an efficient and effective weapon.","Biological agents comprise bacteria, viral, and toxin agents.

What is the future of WMD?,"The viability of the CWC and BCW providing a concrete basis in international law to prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is dubious. The Proliferation Security Initiative to prevent the illicit trade in materials relating to chemical and nuclear weapons is an equally piecemeal pursuit.

What preventative security measures might a government take in defence of a potential future terrorist attack?,"Large terrorist organizations are hard to penetrate, being highly cohesive and centralized in structure.

An intelligence coup greatly enhances the prospect of stopping terrorist operations once the larger group has been compromised.",Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).,"Prevention of terrorism is a highly controversial policy designed to reduce the appeal of terrorism within the population through reform packages. The method is characterized by diplomatic exchanges. However, as a preventative method it has been questioned and it is argued to resemble concessionary politics.","Prevention is conceived as securing the physical integrity of targets and key political installations, particularly weapons installations, national buildings, national or cultural symbols, or defence deployments.

In what ways can a distinction be made between limited force and full-scale force?,The distinction between limited force and full-scale force is the second process of coercive diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy only fails if the coercer fails to achieve its defined goals and fails to defeat its adversary in the second stage.,"The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.","The distinction between limited force and brute force is important because the amount of force that is used to attain the coercer's interests defines the type of outcome that is achieved. If a positive policy outcome is achieved, then we can say that limited force has been employed.",Generally the distinction between brute and limited force is negligible.
