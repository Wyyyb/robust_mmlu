"From the very beginning, I wrote to explain my own life to myself, and I invited any readers who chose to make the journey with me to join me on the high wire. I would work without a net and without the noise of the crowd to disturb me. The view from on high is dizzying, instructive. I do not record the world exactly as it comes to me but transform it by making it pass through a prism of fabulous stories I have collected on the way. I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.,The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.,The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.,The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.,B,ori_mmlu-miscellaneous_test.csv,True,0.005864958744496107,0.9863343834877014,0.006645868998020887,0.0011548787588253617
