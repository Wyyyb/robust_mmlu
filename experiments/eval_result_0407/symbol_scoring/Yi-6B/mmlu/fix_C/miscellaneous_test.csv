"A passage from Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God is as follows. The people all saw her come because it was sundown. The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky.

"From the very beginning, I wrote to explain my own life to myself, and I invited any readers who chose to make the journey with me to join me on the high wire.

I gather stories the way a lepidopterist hoards his chloroformed specimens of rare moths, or Costa Rican beetles. Stories are like vessels I use to interpret the world to myself. ----------Pat Conroy Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",The author provides several explanations for taking a certain course of action.,The author makes a comparison between his own experiences and that of others in his profession.,The author uses analogies to explain his experience of a particular action.,The author chronicles the various phases of his work in a particular discipline.,C,ori_mmlu-miscellaneous_test.csv,False,0.10509186238050461,0.038661133497953415,0.12676496803760529,0.7294820547103882
