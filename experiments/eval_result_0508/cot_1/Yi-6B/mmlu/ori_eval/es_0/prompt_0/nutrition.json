No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanises.\nAnswer: Let's think step by step."}, {"q_id": 9826, "question": "Which membrane fatty acids are precursors for eicosanoids?\n", "options": ["C20 and C22 saturated fatty acids", "C18 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids", "C20 and C22 monounsaturated fatty acids", "C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids"], "answer": "D", "answer_index": 3, "src": "ori_mmlu-nutrition_test.csv", "pred": "D", "pred_score": "True", "full_text_answer": " We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help.

Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\nB. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin\nC. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose\nD. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame.

Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\nB. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin\nC. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose\nD. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame.

Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, or others) is usually the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity. It works by lowering glucose production in the liver and improving the body's sensitivity to insulin. The answer is (B).\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\nOptions: \nA. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\nB. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin\nC. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener sucralose\nD. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener acesulfame K\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. People with phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot break down the amino acid phenylalanine. As it builds up in the blood and brain it can lead to brain damage. People with PKU should avoid foods that are converted to phenylalanine in the body, such as aspartame. The answer is (A).\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about iodine is correct, as of 2020?\nOptions: \nA. 50% of adults consume iodine at levels below the RNI\nB.
