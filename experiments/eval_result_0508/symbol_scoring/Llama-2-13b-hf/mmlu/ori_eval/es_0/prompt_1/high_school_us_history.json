It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nWhich one of the following was an unintended consequence of the liberal successes of the 1960s?", "options": ["Liberal Democrats abandoned anti-war protests in a show of support for President Johnson.", "Conservative Republicans mobilized to defend traditional mores and curb government authority.", "Economic recession catalyzed by increased government spending causing \"stagflation.\"", "A majority of Northern black voters abandoned the Democrat party, siding with Republicans."], "answer": "B", "answer_index": 1, "src": "ori_mmlu-high_school_us_history_test.csv", "pred": "D", "pred_score": "False", "probs": [0.011611128225922585, 0.3845077455043793, 0.11016331613063812, 0.4937177300453186]}, {"q_id": 6005, "question": "This question refers to the following information.\nLet us not, I beseech you sir, deceive ourselves. Sir, we have done everything that could be done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope.\u2026 It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have?

It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat.
