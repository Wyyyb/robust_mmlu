"For its Sanford to Marksville short run,SutlandAirlines has first class, tourist class, and coach accommodations. Packets of three tickets each, called 3-Paks, are available at a special discount. If tickets are sold in accordance with seating capacity, because of ""no shows"" it often happens that flights are not made at full capacity, thus losing money forSutland. IfSutlandoversells a flight and there are not enough cancellations or ""no shows"" to balance the oversubscription, then some passengers are going to be inconvenienced until new arrangements are made. It has been found that passengers thus inconvenienced exhibit essentially three kinds of reaction: I. The passenger who heartily cursesSutlandand then forgets all about his ordeal after new arrangements have been made; II. The passenger who becomes so angry that he never fliesSutlandagain; and III. The passenger whose anger is so great that he never fliesSutlandagain and campaigns to stop other people from flyingSutland. The effects of these reactions have been thoroughly studied, and an annoyance scale has been developed so that these effects can be described in quantitative terms. For a given flight 15 points of reaction I (measured on the annoyance scale), 12 points of reaction II, and 9 points of reaction III can be tolerated at most. Table 1 was developed and distributed to the executives ofSutlandwho are involved in customer relations. From an analysis of the past earnings ofSutlandAirlines, the expected profit on a 3-Pak of first class tickets is $10, the expected profit on a 3-Pak of tourist class tickets is $12, and a 3-Pak of coach tickets nets $14.

Since 1 year has approximately 365 days, T = 0.1 * 365 = 36.5 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 37 days.

Here, we are given I = $6.56, P = $1640, and R = 4% or 0.04. We are asked to solve for T, in days. Rearranging the formula gives T = I / (PR) = 6.56 / (1640 * 0.04) = 0.1 years. Since 1 year has approximately 365 days, T = 0.1 * 365 = 36.5 days. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 37 days.

The proceeds of a discounted note are calculated by subtracting the discount (the interest charged by the bank) from the face value of the note. The discount is calculated by multiplying the face value of the note by the discount rate and the time period. In this case, the time period is the time from the discount date to the note's maturity date, which is about 4 months (from May 17 to September 22). Therefore, the discount is $1,500 * 8% * 4/12 = $40. The proceeds are then $1,500 - $40 = $1,460. However, the note also earns interest for the full 6 months at 6%, which is $1,500 * 6% * 6/12 = $45.
