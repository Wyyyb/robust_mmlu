[{"question_id": 12222, "question": "Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively.

We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. Let\u2019s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let\u2019s recall that for a given set of data, Akaike's information criterion (AIC) allows us to measure how well a statistical model fits the data; it is an estimator of prediction error. Here in this problem we will need to use the formula ln(det(sigma_hat)) + (2 * k / T) to determine the values of Akaike\u2019s criterion, where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, k the total number of parameters in total (across both equations), and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 500). For 1 lag, the number of parameters in total is equal to 6; for 2 lags, it is 10; for 3 lags, it is 14; and for 4 lags, it is 18. Now, let\u2019s calculate the values of the criterion for each lag:\n(A) 1 lag: ln(0.0336) + (2 * 6 / 500) = ln(0.0336) + (12 / 500) = -3.369\n(B) 2 lags: ln(0.0169) + (2 * 10 / 500) = ln(0.0169) + (20 / 500) = -4.040\n(C) 3 lags: ln(0.0084) + (2 * 14 / 500) = ln(0.0084) + (28 / 500) =-4.724\n(D) 4 lags: ln(0.0062) + (2 * 18 / 500) = ln(0.0062) + (36 / 500) =-5.011\nBecause the optimal model order according to AIC minimizes the information criterion, the answer should be the one with the lowest value. In this case, (D) has the lowest value.
