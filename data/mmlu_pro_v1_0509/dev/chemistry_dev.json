A molecule that behaves as a base accepts an H+ ion (or proton) from another molecule, whereas a molecule that behaves as an acid donates an H+ ion (or proton) to another molecule. Neither of these is the case for Cl in this reaction, which rules out (A) and (B). A catalyst is a substance that only accelerates a reaction without itself undergoing chemical change, which is not the case here. This rules out (C). Instead, the $Cl^{-} molecules carry a negative charge, which they donate in the reaction to form 3 HClO2. This is the behavior of a reducing agent, or (D).

An acid anhydride is a compound that is derived by removing water from an acid.
