If we have a an AR(1) model with the disturbances having zero mean and unit variance, then the unconditional mean of y is equal to the following:\nunconditional mean of y = (the intercept term) / (1 - autoregressive coefficient)\nWe know that the intercept term is 0.2 and the autoregressive coefficient is 0.4; thus, we have:\nunconditional mean of y = (0.2) / (1 - 0.4) = (0.2) / (0.6) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3, which is approximately 0.33.
