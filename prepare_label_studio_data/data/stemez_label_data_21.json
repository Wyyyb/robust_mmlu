Mole Method This method requires one to write out the balanced equation that illustrates the neutralization reaction. The balanced equation is 3Ca(OH)_2 + 2H_3PO_4 \\rightarrow Ca_3(PO_4)_2 + 6H_2O. From this equation, one can see that 2 moles of H_3PO_4 react for every 3molesof Ca(OH)_2 . This means that one must first calculate how many moles of Ca(OH)_2 are in-volved, Themolarity of the Ca(OH)_2 is 0.030. (Molarity= no. of moles/liters.) As given, the Ca(OH)_2 solution is 25 ml or 0.025 liters. Therefore, the number of moles of Ca(OH)_2 is (0.030) (0.025) = 0.00075 moles. As the balanced equation indicates, the number of moles of H_3PO_4 is 2/3 the moles of Ca(OH)_2 or 2/3 (0.00075) = 0.00050 moles of H_3PO_4. From the definition ofmolarityfor H_3PO_4 one has 0.025 M = [(0.00050moles)/(liters)]. Themolarity, 0.025, is given. Solving for liters, one obtains 0.020 liters or 20 ml. The key to solving this problem with the mole method, is to write a balanced equation, which will indicate the relative amounts of moles required for complete neutralization. Equivalent Method This method requires that one consider normality and the definition of an equivalent. An equivalent is defined as the molecular weight or mass of an acid or base that furnished one mole of protons (H^+) or hydroxyl (OH^-) ions. For example, the number of equivalents con-tained in a mole of H_2SO_4, is 98/2 or 49, Since each mole of H_2SO_4 produces two protons, divide the molecular weight by 2. The number of equivalents of an acid must equal that of the base in a neutralization reaction. Normality is defined as equivalents of solute per liter. In this problem, it is given that there are 25 ml of 0,03 Ca(OH)_2. To solve the problem, determine how many equivalents are present. The number of moles of Ca(OH)_2 is (0.025)(0.03) or 0,00075 from the definition ofmolarity. The molecular weight of Ca(OH)_2 is 74,08. Therefore, there are (0.00075)(74.08) or 0.06 grams of Ca(OH)_2. The number of equivalents per gram is 74.08/2 since two OH^- can be produced. The number of equivalents is [{(0.00075)(74.08)g} / {(74.08/2) g/equiv}] = 0.0015 equiv of Ca(OH)_2 . This indicates that 0.0015 equivalents of H_3PO_4 are required. The molarityof H_3PO_4, is 0.025 M, which means its normality is 0.075 N, because there are 3ionizableprotons per mole. Recalling the definition of normality, there are 0.075 N = 0.0015 equiv./liters The reason one knows that there is 0.0015 equiv in the H_3PO_4 present is because one knows that for the neutralization to occur the number of equivalents of acid must equal the number of equivalents of base.

Therefore, one can solve this problem by computing how many equivalents are present in 1.48 g of Ca(OH)_2; the equivalents of acid (HCI) must equal this number. An equivalent is defined as the weight of a substance in grams that releases one mole of protons (H^+.) or hydroxyl ions. When one mole of Ca(OH)_2 dissolves in water, it pro-duces 2 moles of hydroxyl ions (OH^-) according to the equation Ca(OH)_2 \\rightarrow Ca^+2 + 2OH^-. The weight of 1 mole of Ca(OH)_2 is equal to its molecular weight. Therefore, Ca(OH)_2 has a weight of 74 grams. Thus, 74 grams of Ca(OH)_2 produces 2 moles of OH^- ions.

There are two rotational degrees of freedom for a diatomic molecule and each degree of freedom contributes (1/2) RT to C_V. \\therefore(1/2) RT + (1/2) RT =RT Thus, the rotational freedom contributes RT to C_V . Thevibrationalmode contributes RT [x / (e^x - 1)] to C_V wherex = (h_\u0475/kT) P = Planck's constant \u0475 = frequency k = Boltzmann's constant From quantum mechanics, thevibrationalmode is quantized and the occupation ofvibrationalenergy levels depends on temperature. The total contribution to C_V from translational, rotational and vibrationalmodes of a diatomic molecule is therefore C_V = (d /dT) (E_translation+E_rotation+ Evibration) (d /dt) [(3/2)RT + RT + RT {x / (e^x - 1)}] = (d /dt) [(5/2) RT + RT {x / (e^x - 1)}] \\thereforeC_V = (5/2) R + {(Rx^2e^x) / (e^x - 1)^2 } Note thatdE=C_VdT, by definition andC_V = (dE/dT) whereE =E_trans+E_rot+E_vib Recall that x is also a function of temperature.

The unit cells contain only points that locate atomic or molecular centers. since atoms are space-filling entities, their structures can be described as resulting from the packing together of representative spheres. The most efficient packing together of equal spheres is called closest packing. In this problem, you are asked for a distance between two planes, which is just the spacing between the layers of spheres. A face- centered cube, a type of unit cell, is a close packed structure. From the accompanying figure, you can see that the body diagonal of a face- centered cube is perpendicular to the close-packed stacking layers. Thus, if you stand it on a corner, the close packed layers will be parallel to the floor. To see this more clearly, you can use models. From this, you can relate the body diagonal to the spacing between layers. Namely, body diagonal = 3 times the spacing. Thus, you need to find the length of the body diagonal.

The unit cells contain only points that locate atomic or molecular centers. since atoms are space-filling entities, their structures can be described as resulting from the packing together of representative spheres. The most efficient packing together of equal spheres is called closest packing. In this problem, you are asked for a distance between two planes, which is just the spacing between the layers of spheres. A face- centered cube, a type of unit cell, is a close packed structure. From the accompanying figure, you can see that the body diagonal of a face- centered cube is perpendicular to the close-packed stacking layers. Thus, if you stand it on a corner, the close packed layers will be parallel to the floor. To see this more clearly, you can use models. From this, you can relate the body diagonal to the spacing between layers. Namely, body diagonal = 3 times the spacing. Thus, you need to find the length of the body diagonal.

Rate = k [X][Y]^2, k = 35.0 M^-2 min^-1, initial rate = .401 M/min, second rate is 1/6 of the first\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\n(a) All of the components in this system are in the gaseous phase, thus the system is homogeneous. The rate of a reaction in a gaseous homogeneous system is dependent upon the concentration of the reactants. In a gaseous system, concentration is a function of the press-ure of the system. From the data given in the table, one can see that when the concentration of Y is held constant and the concentration of X is doubled, the rate is quadrupled. Therefore, the rate is proportional to [X]^2 . When the concentration of X is held constant and the concentration of Y is doubled, the rate is doubled and is thus proportional to [Y]. The rate law for this reaction can thus be written Rate = k [X]^2[Y] where k is the rate constant. (b) The numerical value of k is found by substituting in values for [X], [Y] and the rate into the rate law. Con-centration values for X and Y may be obtained from any one line of the table. The values obtained from the first line of the table are (0.030 M/min ) = k (0.10 M)^2(0.10 M) (0.030 M/min ) / [(0.10 M)^2(0.10 M)] = k = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 = k (c) One can solve for the initial rate of the formation of Z by using the rate law and k when [X] and [Y] are given. Thus, Rate = k[X]^2[Y] Rate = (30.0 M^-2 min^-1)(0.15 M)^2 (0.15 M) =.101 M/min. (d) According to Boyle's Law the pressure is in-versely proportional to the volume, Therefore, if the volume is doubled the pressure is halved. Because the re-actants in this system are gases . when the pressure is halved, the concentration is halved, One can find the rate of the reaction described in (c) by using the rate law with the concentrations of the reactants halved Rate = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 (1/2(0.15 M))^2(1/2(0.15 M)) = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 (.075 M)^2(.075 M) = 1.27 \u00d7 10^-2 M/min The percent of the first rate that the second rate is equal to is found by dividing the second rate by the first and then multiplying the quotient by 100.

The rate of a reaction in a gaseous homogeneous system is dependent upon the concentration of the reactants. In a gaseous system, concentration is a function of the press-ure of the system. From the data given in the table, one can see that when the concentration of Y is held constant and the concentration of X is doubled, the rate is quadrupled. Therefore, the rate is proportional to [X]^2 . When the concentration of X is held constant and the concentration of Y is doubled, the rate is doubled and is thus proportional to [Y]. The rate law for this reaction can thus be written Rate = k [X]^2[Y] where k is the rate constant. (b) The numerical value of k is found by substituting in values for [X], [Y] and the rate into the rate law. Con-centration values for X and Y may be obtained from any one line of the table. The values obtained from the first line of the table are (0.030 M/min ) = k (0.10 M)^2(0.10 M) (0.030 M/min ) / [(0.10 M)^2(0.10 M)] = k = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 = k (c) One can solve for the initial rate of the formation of Z by using the rate law and k when [X] and [Y] are given. Thus, Rate = k[X]^2[Y] Rate = (30.0 M^-2 min^-1)(0.15 M)^2 (0.15 M) =.101 M/min. (d) According to Boyle's Law the pressure is in-versely proportional to the volume, Therefore, if the volume is doubled the pressure is halved. Because the re-actants in this system are gases . when the pressure is halved, the concentration is halved, One can find the rate of the reaction described in (c) by using the rate law with the concentrations of the reactants halved Rate = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 (1/2(0.15 M))^2(1/2(0.15 M)) = 30.0 M^-2 min^-1 (.075 M)^2(.075 M) = 1.27 \u00d7 10^-2 M/min The percent of the first rate that the second rate is equal to is found by dividing the second rate by the first and then multiplying the quotient by 100.

Upon rearranging, V = (RT / 2P) [1 + [1 - {4aP / (R^2 T^2)}]^1/2](6) If deviation from ideality is small, the term [4aP / (R^2 T^2)] inequation (6) is equation (6) is small. Therefore, [1 - {4a / (R^2 T^2)}]^1/2 can be approximated by [1 - {2aP / (R^2 T^2)}].(7) Now, fugacity f = P exp^P\\int_0 [ (Z - 1) / P]dP(8) where Z = compression factor. Because of the small deviation from ideality, this can be approximated by [1 - {aP/ (R^2 T^2)}]. Therefore equation (8) becomes P exp [-aP/ (R^2 T^2)].(9) Remember that this is for the condition, b = 0. Recall that when a = 0, P = [RT / (V - b)] \\thereforePV -Pb= RT andPV = RT +Pb \\thereforeV = (RT / P) + b So, Z can be approximated by 1 + (Pb/ RT). Therefore, f = P exp ^P\\int_0 (b/RT)dP= P exp (Pb/RT)(10) Using the data given, equation (9) becomes f = (10atm)exp [{- (4.17 dm^6atmmol^-2) (10atm)} / {(0.082 dm^3atmK^-1 mol^-1)^2 (298\\textdegreeK)^2}] \\thereforef = (10atm)exp(- 0.0698) = 10(e^-0.0698) f = (10) (0.93) = 9.3atm Also equation (10) becomes f = (10atm) exp [{(0.037)(10)} / {(0.082)(298)}] \\thereforef = (10) exp(0.0151) = 10(e^0.0151) \\thereforef = (10) (1.02) = 10.2 atm. The results show that the effect of the constantais to reduce the fugacity and that of constant b is to increase it.

If this is a truly buffered system, then, the pH should be only slightly altered when a small quantity of base is added. Since we are using bases it will be more convenient to work initially withpOH. pH is converted topOHby the equation: 14 = pH +pOHorpOH= 14 -pH. Substituting the given value of pH,pOH= 14 - 9 = 5. In part (a) one is asked to choose the strongest base. At a given pOH, the strongest base haspOHabout equal topK_b(the pH at which dissociation occurs). The maximum buffering capacity and minimum sensitivity to pH change occurs when the concentrations of the acid and base are initially equal. From a table ofpK_bvalues, it is found that pK_NH3 = 4.75, pK_C5H5N = 8.81, and pK_CH3CH2NH2 = 3.3 Therefore, NH_3 has apK_b closest to 5, which means it is the best base. To prepare a one liter solution, as requested in part (b) , find the initial concentrations of the components to be added and their ratio. NH_3 is the base and NH_4Cl dissociates to the acid NH_4^+ . The reaction equation is NH_3 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows NH_4^+ + OH^- K_b = 1.76 \u00d7 10^-5. To find the ratio, set up the equilibrium constant equation: K_b = {[NH_4^+][OH^-]} / [NH_3] = 1.76 \u00d7 10^-5. Rewriting to obtain the ratio, one has: [NH_4^+] / [NH_3] = {Kb/ [OH^-] = [(1.76 \u00d7 10^-5) / (1.0 \u00d7 10^-5)] = 1.76 . ([OH^-] = 1 \u00d7 10^-5,sincepOH= 5 andpOH= - log [OH^-].) Therefore, NH_4Cl and NH_3 should be added in the molar ratio of 1.76 : 1. Since it is given that the sum of the concentrations of the buffering reagents equals 0.5 mole/liter, the following equation can be written which says, in effect, that the sum of the parts is equal to the whole [NH_3] + [NH_4^+ ] = 0.5. Let [NH_3] = x and since the ratio is 1.76 : 1, let [NH_4^+] = 1.76 x. This results in x + 1.76 x = 0.5 x = [NH_3] = 0.18 mole/liter 1.76 x = [NH_4^+ ] = 0.32 mole/liter. Therefore, to prepare a 1 liter solution, mix 0.18 moles NH_3 and 0.32 moles NH_4Cl and then add H_2O until a total volume of 1 liter is obtained. Part (c) tells one to add 0.02 MNaOH. Since it is a strong base, complete dissociation occurs giving 0.02 mole Na^+ and 0.02 mole OH^-. The base OH^- then reacts fully with the acid NH_4^+ and converts 0.02 mole NH_4^+ to NH_3.

Therefore, by subtracting the normal amount from the total, and then dividing this difference by the total, the fraction of ^40Ar derived from ^40K can be found. Hence, [(75,200 - 296) / (75,200)] = .996 This is now the correction factor to be multiplied in front of N_40,Ar to find N_40,Ar from decay of ^40K . Hence, N_40,Ar = 2,5535 \u00d710^20 atoms/kg sample \u00d7 .996 = 2,5433 \u00d710^20 atoms/kg sample Next, the number of atoms/kg sample must be found. It is known that the percent of potassium (by weight) in 1 kg sample is 3%. Therefore, the fraction of potassium in 1000 g is [(3 \u00d7 10^-2) / (kg sample)] (1000 g). Hence, the number of moles/kg sample of kg sample potassium is [{((3 \u00d7 10^-2) / (kg sample)) (1000 g)} / {39.1 (g / mol)}] = .767 (mol / kg sample) K However, not all of the potassium in the sample is ^40K. The percent abundance of ^40K is 1.18 \u00d7 10^-2 . Hence, the fraction of ^40K in the sample is 1.18 \u00d7 10^-4 . Therefore, the number of {(moles of) / (kg sample)} ^40K is given by, .767 mol/kg sample \u00d7 1.18 \u00d7 10^-4 = 9.05 \u00d7 10^-5 mol/kg sample The number of atoms of ^40K/kg sample can now be found by mul-tiplying by Avogadro's number.

From this we obtain the concentration of hydroxyl contributed by the hydrolysis of sodium acetate. The concentration of hydroniumion, and consequently the pH, is determined by using the water constant. The dissociation of acetic acid (HAc) intohydroniumions and acetate ions (Ac-) may be represented by the equation HAc+ H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + Ac^-. The dissociation constant for this reaction is K_a = {[H_3O^+][Ac^-]} / [HAc] This constant and the water constant, K_W = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = 10^-14 mole^2/liter^2 will be used to determine the hydrolysis constant for acetate. Hydrolysis of acetate proceeds according to the following equation: Ac^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrowsHAc+ OH^-. The hydrolysis constant isK_h= [HAc][OH^-] / [Ac^-].

Let the equilibrium concentration ofHAcformed by the hydrolysis of acetate be x. Since one mole of OH^- is formed per mole ofHAcformed, the equilibrium concentration of OH^- is also x. Furthermore, if we assume that sodium acetate dissociates completely, then the initial con-centration of Ac^- is equal to the concentration of sodium acetate (1.0 M) and the equilibrium concentration of acetate is 1.0 - x.

Calculate what volume of air is required for its complete combustion at S.T.P.\n\nOptions:\nA. 19,587.70 liters air\nB. 44,204.56 liters air\nC.             39,175.40 liters air\nD. 26,116.93 liters air\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nTo answer this problem, you need to write the balanced equation for the combustion of octane gasoline. This means knowing what the molecular formula of octane gasoline is and what is meant by combustion. Octane is a saturated hydrocarbon, i.e., it is analkane. Now, by saturated hydrocarbon, you mean a compound that contains only single bonds between the carbon to carbon and carbon to hydrogen bonds.Alkanes have the general formula C_NH2 N+2'where N = number of carbon atoms. Since the prefix \"oct\" means eight, you know there are 8 carbon atoms, which indicates that 18 hydrogen atoms are present. Thus, gasoline octane has the formula C_8H_18 . Now, by combustion you mean the reaction of an organic compound with oxygen to produce CO_2 and H_2O. With this in mind, you can write the balanced equation for the reaction as 2C_8H_18 + 25O_2 \\rightarrow 16CO_2 + 18H_2O. To find out what volume of air is required for combustion, you need the volume of O_2 required, since 20% of air is oxygen (O_2). To find the amount of O_2 involved, use the fact that at S.T.P. (standard temperature and pressure) 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, if you knew how many moles of O_2 were required, you would know its volume. You can find the number of moles by usingstoichiometry. You are told that there exists 3.19 kg or 3190 g (1000 g = 1 kg). The molecular weight (MW) of octane is 114 grams/mole. Thus, since mole = [grams (weight)] / M.W.] , you have (3190 / 114) = 27.98 moles of gasoline. From the equation's coefficients, you see that for every 2molesof gasoline, 25molesof O_2 are required. Thus, for this number of moles of gasoline, you need (27.98) (25 / 2) = 349.78 moles of O_2. Recalling that 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at S.T.P., 349.78 moles of O_2 occupies (349.78) (22.4) = 7835.08 liters. Oxygen is 20% of the air. Thus, the amount of air required is (5 liters air) / (1 liter O_2 ) \u00d7 7835.08 liters O_2 = 39,175.40 liters air.", "ref_id": 4361, "meta_info": {"subject": "chemistry.csv", "src": "stemez-Chemistry", "question": "4 liters of octane gasoline weigh 3.19 kg.

Now, by combustion you mean the reaction of an organic compound with oxygen to produce CO_2 and H_2O. With this in mind, you can write the balanced equation for the reaction as 2C_8H_18 + 25O_2 \\rightarrow 16CO_2 + 18H_2O. To find out what volume of air is required for combustion, you need the volume of O_2 required, since 20% of air is oxygen (O_2). To find the amount of O_2 involved, use the fact that at S.T.P. (standard temperature and pressure) 1 mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. Thus, if you knew how many moles of O_2 were required, you would know its volume. You can find the number of moles by usingstoichiometry. You are told that there exists 3.19 kg or 3190 g (1000 g = 1 kg). The molecular weight (MW) of octane is 114 grams/mole. Thus, since mole = [grams (weight)] / M.W.] , you have (3190 / 114) = 27.98 moles of gasoline. From the equation's coefficients, you see that for every 2molesof gasoline, 25molesof O_2 are required. Thus, for this number of moles of gasoline, you need (27.98) (25 / 2) = 349.78 moles of O_2. Recalling that 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters at S.T.P., 349.78 moles of O_2 occupies (349.78) (22.4) = 7835.08 liters. Oxygen is 20% of the air. Thus, the amount of air required is (5 liters air) / (1 liter O_2 ) \u00d7 7835.08 liters O_2 = 39,175.40 liters air."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nAssume that 90% of the electron density is representative of the volume of the atom.

This occurs because water can dissociate to H^+ and OH^- ions, and these can react with ions from weak acids and bases. This necessitates a consideration ofK_hyd, the hydrolysis constant.

Therefore, K_hyd=K_w/ K_a = {[HC_2H_3O_2] [OH^-]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-]. From the equation that depicts the reaction one can see that the [OH^-] = [HC_2H_3O_2], since for every molecule of OH^-, a molecule of HC_2H_3O_2 must be generated. One can say K_w/ K_a = {[OH^-] [OH^-]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-]or [OH^-]^2 =K_w/ K_a = [C_2H_3O_2^-]. K_w/K_a is small enough so that [C_2H_3O_2^-] at equilibrium will have a value as if hydrolysis had not occurred.

It is not based on the actual amount of energy absorbed by the receiving source. It is therefore defined as the amount of ion pairs formed in air. Hence, 1r = 1.61 \u00d7 10^15 ion pairs/kg of air, or upon conversion, 1r = 2.57976 \u00d7 10^-4 C/kg.

Therad unit is used for all types of radiation (not just ionizing radiation). In considering damage done to living tissue, other factors besides energy release, are important. Hence each type of radiation has its relative biological effectiveness (rbe). For \\alpha particlesrbe= 20, and for \\gamma radiation, rbe= 1.
