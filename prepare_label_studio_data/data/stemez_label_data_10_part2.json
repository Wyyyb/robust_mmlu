Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Raven's Progressive Matrices, Differential Ability Scales\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nTraditionally, cross-cultural tests have tried to eliminate those factors or characteristics not of interest which differentiate between two cultures. One example of such a characteristic is language. We may presume that the administrator of the test knows that the two cultures have different languages. Language differences are not of interest, the examiner is trying to measure some other variable (intelligence, perhaps). The examiner's concern, then, is that he wants to make sure that language does not affect his measure of intelligence. There are two ways to deal with the problem of language. The first way is to translate a given test into the language of the target population. Translated tests have two problems, however. First, the translation may not be equivalent to the original. Second, the translated tests should be standardized on a new sample of speakers of that language. The second way to deal with the problem of language is to completely eliminate language from the test. When educational backgrounds differ widely and perhaps some groups of examiners are inferior in reading skills it is best to eliminate reading and other verbal skills from the test. Different cultures often differ with regard to the value attached to speed of performance; in some cultures the tempo of daily life is slower and there is less concern with accomplishing tasks as quickly as possible. These cultural differences may be attributable to climate differences or perhaps to differences between urban and rural environments. Therefore, cross-cultural tests often try to eliminate the influence of speed by allowing long time limits and putting no premium on faster performance. The most important factor that cross-cultural tests differ on is test content. Certain tests may require that the examinee be familiar with the function of objects that are absent in his culture or which have different uses or values in his culture. Persons reared in certain cultures lack the experience to respond correctly to these items. Therefore, examiners who are interested in developing cross-cultural tests are careful about the nature of the test content. TheLeiterInternational Performance Scale is an individually administered performance scale which almost completely eliminates instructions, both spoken and pantomime. The examiner's comprehension of his task is considered as part of the test. TheLeiterscale consists of a response frame with an adjustable card holder. The examiner administers the test by sliding a particular card with printed pictures on it onto the response frame. The examinee is given a set of blocks with printed pictures on them and is supposed to choose the blocks with the proper response pictures and insert them into the correct frame. Among the tasks included in theLeiterscale are: matching identical colors, shades of gray, forms, or pictures; copying a block design; picture completion, number estimation, analogies, series completion, recognition of age differences, spatial relations, footprint recognition, similarities, memory for a series, and classification of animals according to habitat. TheLeiterScale has no time limit. The scale is scored in terms of the ratio of mental age (MA) over chronological age [(mental age) / (chronological age)] However, it should be noted that theLeiterScale IQ does not always correlate highly with the Stanford-Binetand the Wechsler IQ's; it is probable that theLeiterIQ is a measure of different intellectual characteristics. R. B.Cattelldeveloped the Culture Fair Intelligence Test, a paper-and-pencil test available in three levels each level having a varying number of subtests. The highest level consists of the following four subtests: series, classification, matrices, and conditions. For the series subtest, the examinee selects the item that completes the series. In classification, the examinee marks the item in each row that does not belong. The matrices subtest requires that the subject mark the item that completes the given matrix, or pattern. The subject's task in the conditions subtest is to insert a dot in one of the alternative designs so as to meet the same conditions indicated in the sample design. Unfortunately,Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test does not completely compensate for cultural disadvantages. In cultures different from the one in which the test was developed, performance was considerably below the original norms. Moreover, Black children of low socioeconomic level did no better on this test than on the Stanford-Binet. The \"Progressive Matrices\" were developed by Raven and were designed to measure Spearman's \"g\" factor, i.e., innate generalized intellectual ability. The test consists of 60 matrices (designs), of varying complexity, from which a part has been removed. The subject's task is to choose the missing insert from a set of eight alternatives. The matrices are grouped in five series. The earlier series require accuracy of discrimination; the later, more difficult series involve analogies, permutation and alternation of pattern, and other logical relations. The test is only moderately successful in predicting future academic achievement. Studies in a number of non-European cultures have shown that the test is probably not suitable for groups with very dissimilar backgrounds. In theGoodenoughDraw-a-Man Test the subject (the test is designed for use with children) is simply instructed to \"make a picture of a man; make the very best picture that you can.\" Emphasis is placed on the child's accuracy of observation and on the development of conceptual thinking, rather than on artistic skill. Credit is given for the inclusion of individual body parts, clothing details, proportion, perspective, and similar features. A total of 73scorableitems were selected on the basis of age differentiation, relation to total scores on the test, and relation to group intelligence test scores. Test scores are translated into standard scores with a mean of 100. Again, these test scores should not be confused with IQ. Unfortunately, it has been found that performance on this test is more dependent on differences in cultural background than was original assumed. The search for a perfectly \"culture-free test\" is probably futile. It may be impossible to create a test free of all of the possible biasing variables.",

An important source of information relevant to this research comesfrom the study of the aftereffects of strong stimulation. After looking intenselyat a brightly colored light if the gaze is directed to a smooth white surfacethe same light will be seen, only in the complementary color.

Then apattern of black and white lines at differing orientations was presented to thesubject. To the subject, the horizontal white lines looked reddish; the verticalwhite lines looked greenish; oblique lines look white. This is the McCullough Effect. The explanation of these results comes from a considerationof colored-line feature detectors. The strategy used was to fatigueone set of line detectors, then present a neutral object (black and whitelines). If a complementary set of features exists, they would show themselves.

Fiedler's model suggests the effectiveness of a leader is determined solely by their personality.\nC.             Fiedler's contingency model of leadership suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power.\nD. Fiedler's model implies that a leader's effectiveness is determined by their ability to adapt their style to every situation.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIs there a \"best\" leadership style? That is, is there a relationship between a leader's style and his effectiveness in getting the group to perform the task at hand? Fiedler, in approaching this question developed a contingency model for leadership. The effectiveness of the leader depended, or was \"contingent,\" upon the interaction between the leader's style and three situational factors. His model was developed from his research activities involving managers and supervisors in a variety of organizational settings. Using a series of tests to obtain data on the values and attitudes and \"style\" of each manager, he obtained information in two basic areas: 1. Assumed similarity between opposites--This measurement determines the degree of similarity between a leader's rating of his most preferred coworker and his least preferred coworker. 2. Least preferred coworker--This score measures the degree to which managers are favorable in their ratings of least preferred coworkers. Someone who rates his least preferred coworker relatively favorably, and who does not differentiate significantly between his most preferred coworker and his least preferred coworker, is called a high-LPC leader. This leader tends to adopt a democratic person-oriented style. A person who rates his least preferred coworker very unfavorably, and who sees a wide differential between the characteristics of his most and least preferred coworker, is called a low-LPC leader and tends to adopt a task-oriented autocratic style. According to Fiedler, the leader who uses the human relations style is concerned about the feelings of others and derives satisfaction from a good relationship with his coworkers. The task-oriented individual, on the other hand, is concerned primarily with the task at hand and directs efforts toward productivity rather than personal relations. Fiedler makes the point that a leader's ability to influence the behavior of others is a function of selecting the appropriate style of leadership. The appropriate style may be different for different groups in different situations which brings us back to the three situational factors he believes will have the most significant impact in determining the appropriate style of leadership for any given situation: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power. When these three aspects were either very positive or very negative for the leader, a task- oriented, autocratic leader was most effective. When the situation was intermediate a democratic, person-oriented leader was more effective. This model has great logical appeal. For example, if group members know what they are supposed to do, like the leader, and the leader has a strong power position, there is no need to be person- oriented; it would be inefficient and a waste of time. Also, if group members did not know what they were to do, did not like the leader and the leader had a weak power position, it would still seem that a highly autocratic person would be the most efficient type in that situation. Attending to the personal needs of the group members would be a waste of time and interfere with the accomplishment of the task. A democratic leader will only prove to be effective in a situation that is moderate in the three aspects mentioned above, in which either leader power, task structuring or leader-member relations could be developed or strengthened. To start with the situation would need to be moderately favorable to the leader. While there have been some recent criticisms of Fiedler's model, it is still widely accepted in management theory and practice.",

Someone who rates his least preferred coworker relatively favorably, and who does not differentiate significantly between his most preferred coworker and his least preferred coworker, is called a high-LPC leader. This leader tends to adopt a democratic person-oriented style. A person who rates his least preferred coworker very unfavorably, and who sees a wide differential between the characteristics of his most and least preferred coworker, is called a low-LPC leader and tends to adopt a task-oriented autocratic style. According to Fiedler, the leader who uses the human relations style is concerned about the feelings of others and derives satisfaction from a good relationship with his coworkers. The task-oriented individual, on the other hand, is concerned primarily with the task at hand and directs efforts toward productivity rather than personal relations. Fiedler makes the point that a leader's ability to influence the behavior of others is a function of selecting the appropriate style of leadership. The appropriate style may be different for different groups in different situations which brings us back to the three situational factors he believes will have the most significant impact in determining the appropriate style of leadership for any given situation: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power. When these three aspects were either very positive or very negative for the leader, a task- oriented, autocratic leader was most effective. When the situation was intermediate a democratic, person-oriented leader was more effective. This model has great logical appeal. For example, if group members know what they are supposed to do, like the leader, and the leader has a strong power position, there is no need to be person- oriented; it would be inefficient and a waste of time. Also, if group members did not know what they were to do, did not like the leader and the leader had a weak power position, it would still seem that a highly autocratic person would be the most efficient type in that situation. Attending to the personal needs of the group members would be a waste of time and interfere with the accomplishment of the task. A democratic leader will only prove to be effective in a situation that is moderate in the three aspects mentioned above, in which either leader power, task structuring or leader-member relations could be developed or strengthened. To start with the situation would need to be moderately favorable to the leader. While there have been some recent criticisms of Fiedler's model, it is still widely accepted in management theory and practice."

The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, modeling, and cognitive restructuring.\nD. The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive restructuring, and art therapy.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nBehavior therapy, also called behavior modification, is an attempt to studyand change abnormal behavior by drawing on the methods used by experimentalpsychologists in their study of normal behavior. Four differenttechniques of behavior therapy can be distinguished: 1)counterconditioning, 2) operant conditioning, 3) modeling and 4)cognitiverestructuring. Incounterconditioning, an undesired response to a given stimulus iseliminated by calling forth a new response in the presence of that stimulus. Suppose that a child hasnyctophobia-- fear of the dark. Whenever he finds himself in a dark place (stimulus), he experiences intensefeelings of anxiety (undesired response). The goal of counterconditioningwould be to elicit a new, positive response in the youngclient while he is confronted with darkness. This might be achieved byfeeding the child one of his favorite foods in the dark. In this fashion, thefear (undesired response) produced by darkness (stimulus) might be dispelledby the positive feelings (new response) associated with eating. Repeated associations of darkness with positive feelings would most likely curethe client of his phobia. Three frequently usedcounterconditioningtechniques are: a)systematicdesensitization b) assertive training, and c) aversive conditioning. Systematic desensitization, formulated by JosephWolpe, is a procedurein which a deeply relaxed person is asked to imagine a series ofanxiety-provoking situations, along a continuum. For example, a person whois afraid of taking tests will first be told to imagine the teacher telling theclass of an upcoming test; then he'll be told to think of himself studying forthe test and finally, he must imagine he is actually taking the test. This proceduremay require more intermediary steps, in which the person is toldto imagine more scenes before the final one, which is more anxiety producing. The number of additional steps depends on the level of anxiety. The relaxation serves to inhibit any anxiety that might otherwise beproduced by the imagined scenes. The imagined scene can be viewed asthe stimulus; the anxiety elicited by the scene is the undesired response, and relaxation is the new response. It has been found that the abilityto tolerate stressful imagery is generally followed by a reduction of anxietyin similar real-life situations. Assertive training is helpful to those people who are unable to expresspositive or negative feelings to others. For example, consider a manwho is often treated rudely by a business associate but is too timid to protestor express resentment. Because of his suppressed negative feelings, he experiences anxiety whenever he comes into contact with the businessassociate. Assertive training assumes that expression of positive ornegative feelings cancounterconditionthe anxiety associated with specificinterpersonal situations. Applying this assumption to our example, theanxiety (undesired response) elicited by the presence of the rude businessassociate (stimulus) would be counteracted if the timid man were toexpress his true feelings to the associate (new response). Another variant ofcounterconditioningis aversive conditioning, whichattempts to attach negative feelings to stimuli that are considered inappropriatelyattractive. Imagine that a foot fetishist wishes to be less attractedto the sight or feel of feet. To reduce the attraction, a therapist mightgive him repeated electric shocks as pictures of feet are presented. The goal of such therapy would be to make feet (stimulus) elicit anxiety (newresponse) rather than feelings of attraction (undesired response). Operant conditioning, also known as behavior shaping, is another techniqueof behavior therapy. The principles of operant conditioning are verystraightforward: behaviors whose frequency it is desirable to increaseare rewarded and behaviors whose frequency it is desirable to decreaseare either ignored or punished. Operant conditioning has been appliedto the populations of many mental institutions in the form of a tokeneconomy. Patients are systematically reinforced with plastic tokens thatcan later be exchanged for goods and privileges. The results of such programshave been very encouraging. Operant conditioning has also beensuccessful in the treatment of children with behavior problems. A third technique of behavior therapy is modeling, which involves learningby observing and imitating the behavior of others. As an example, examinehow modeling would be used to rid a client of a dog phobia. The therapistmight expose the client to both live and filmed displays of peopleinteracting fearlessly with dogs. Hopefully, the client would imitate themodels he has been exposed to and eventually overcome his fear of dogs. A number of research programs have shown that this kind of learningis helping people acquire new responses in a relatively short time. Cognitive restructuring, the fourth technique of behavior modification, attempts to directly manipulate the thinking and reasoning processesof the client. Perhaps the best example of a cognitive restructuringprocedure is rational-emotive therapy, which has developed fromthe work of Albert Ellis. Rational-emotive therapy assumes: 1) people cognitivelyinterpret what is happening around them; 2) sometimes these interpretationscan cause emotional turmoil; and 3) a therapist's attention shouldbe focused on these internal sentences and not on historical causes. An example of an internal belief which may lead to distress is the notionthat it is imperative to be thoroughly competent in everything one does. A person functioning with this idea in mind will view every error he makesas a catastrophe. A rational-emotive therapist would help such a clientby first making him aware of the irrational structure under which he isliving and then guiding him towards a belief in realistic goals.",

An individualperforms one act after another until the act is effective in attainingthe goal. If the first act doesn't bring about the desired end, it is discardedand another one is tried in its place. Finally, one act or response willbe found to deliver the desired goal. The individual has thus learned theappropriate act or response by experience. An example of this form of learningis seen when a small child wants to eat cookies from a box. First hetries to pull the box apart. Next he tries to jump on the box. He may eventhrow the box on the floor. Finally, he cries for help and his mother comesto open the box. He has learned through trial and error that the mostsuccessful way to open the box is to cry for help. The trial and error method is not efficient for learning complex motorskills because the correct responses may occur very infrequently. It wouldbe very dangerous, for example, to allow a first-time flyer to pilot a planeby trial and error. An effective way of learning motor skills is by the methodof differential reinforcement of successive approximations. This method involves the reinforcement of acts similar to the desiredone (an approximation). The method involves differential reinforcement, that is, the same act is not continually reinforced; during eachsuccessive trial reinforcement is given only if the subject engages in anact that more closely resembles the desired act. As the training proceeds, closer and closer approximations to the desired goal are requiredfor reinforcement. Learning becomes a series of gradual steps. For the airplane pilot, this means beginning his training on the ground at school, progressing to working controls in a plane on the ground, moving tosimple training planes and finally attempting more difficult combat or passengerplanes. If he attempted to fly initially in a combat plane, simple trial and error methods would be extremely dangerous.",

            "text": "Question:\nWhat does Freud claim to be the main function of dreams? How is this function fulfilled?\n\nOptions:\nA. Dreams are a prediction of future events\nB. Dreams are a response to our physical body needs\nC.             Dreams are a reflection of our daily activities\nD. Freud claims the main function of dreams is wish fulfillment. This function is fulfilled through a hallucinatory state that structures events not as they would be in reality, but as the dreamer wishes them to be.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nTo Freud dreams represented attempts at wish fulfillment. He reasoned that the dream is a hallucinatory state that structures events not as they would be in reality, but as the dreamer wishes them to be. When unconscious desires conflict with conscious restraints, however, it is necessary for the \"dream work\" to pursue devious paths to express the wish. Dream Analysis An infantile dream, recalled many years later, points for Freud to the deep-seatedness and long-lastingness of psychosexual experiences in the infant years. A man, now thirty-five, relates a clearly remembered dream which he claims to have had when he was four years of age: The notary with whom his father's will was deposited-he had lost his father at the age of three- brought two large emperor pears, of which he was given one to eat. The other lay on the windowsill of the livingroom. He woke with the conviction of the reality of what he had dreamt, and obstinately asked his mother to give him the second pear; it was, he said, still lying on the windowsill. His mother laughed at this. Freud says: The dreamer's inability to associate justifies the attempt to interpret it by the substitution of symbols. The two pears...are the breasts of the mother who nursed him; the windowsill is a projection of the bosom. His sensation of reality after waking is justified, for his mother had actually suckled him for much longer than the customary term, and her breast was still available. The dream is to be translated: \"Mother, give me the breast again at which I once used to drink.\" The \"once\" is represented by the eating of one pear, the \"again\" by the desire for the other. Thus, Freud believed dreams to be an uncommonly rich source of unconscious material. He maintained that a skilled observer reviewing the contents of dreams could discover much useful information in the unconscious mind of the dreamer. Thus, Freud referred to dreams as \"the royal road to the unconscious.\" Because of the disguised nature of wish fulfillment in dreams, Freud distinguished between the manifest content of a dream, (the literal content of the dream as experienced by the dreamer) and the latent content, (the hidden, symbolic, actual meaning of the dream.) The mental processes that convert wishes and impulses into the disguised images of the manifest content are called the \"dream work.\" It is the function of the psychoanalyst to interpret or undo this dream work, to unravel the manifest content and reveal the more fundamental latent content from which the dream was derived. The study and interpretation of dream imagery was one of Freud's major contributions to the study of the unconscious. He believed that a \"censorship system\" existed at the border of the conscious mind that was very selective about the impulses it would allow the dreamer to recall to his conscious mind. Wishes that would be morally unacceptable to the awake dreamer would not be allowed to appear undisguised in a dream. This distortion by the censorship system made possible the fulfillment of hidden wishes without too much disturbance to the dreamer. Thus, the only way that the unconscious could achieve satisfaction for its strong desires was by evading the censor by masquerading the unacceptability of its wishes behind the facade of neutral objects or ideas. Comparison of Three Views of Personality Psychoanalytic Theory Behavioristic Theory Humanistic Theory View of human nature negative neutral positive Is behavior free or determined? determined determined free choice Principal motives sex and aggression drives of all kinds habits self-actualization Personality structure id, ego, superego habits self Role of unconscious maximized practically nonexistent minimized Conception of conscious superego self- reinforcement ideal self, valuing process Developmental emphasis psychosexual stages critical learning situations identification and imitation development of self-image Barriers to personal growth unconscious conflicts fixations maladaptive habits; pathological environment conditions of worth; incongruence It is the unconscious and the censor together, therefore, that are responsible for dream content and it is for this reason that their interpretation could contribute so much to the understanding of the dreamer's motivations.",

The dream is to be translated: \"Mother, give me the breast again at which I once used to drink.\" The \"once\" is represented by the eating of one pear, the \"again\" by the desire for the other. Thus, Freud believed dreams to be an uncommonly rich source of unconscious material. He maintained that a skilled observer reviewing the contents of dreams could discover much useful information in the unconscious mind of the dreamer. Thus, Freud referred to dreams as \"the royal road to the unconscious.\" Because of the disguised nature of wish fulfillment in dreams, Freud distinguished between the manifest content of a dream, (the literal content of the dream as experienced by the dreamer) and the latent content, (the hidden, symbolic, actual meaning of the dream.) The mental processes that convert wishes and impulses into the disguised images of the manifest content are called the \"dream work.\" It is the function of the psychoanalyst to interpret or undo this dream work, to unravel the manifest content and reveal the more fundamental latent content from which the dream was derived. The study and interpretation of dream imagery was one of Freud's major contributions to the study of the unconscious. He believed that a \"censorship system\" existed at the border of the conscious mind that was very selective about the impulses it would allow the dreamer to recall to his conscious mind. Wishes that would be morally unacceptable to the awake dreamer would not be allowed to appear undisguised in a dream. This distortion by the censorship system made possible the fulfillment of hidden wishes without too much disturbance to the dreamer. Thus, the only way that the unconscious could achieve satisfaction for its strong desires was by evading the censor by masquerading the unacceptability of its wishes behind the facade of neutral objects or ideas.

Research in regard to aggressive behavior, both physical and psychological, has produced evidence to support the explanation that inequity is instrumental in causing aggression. In some conditions, individuals perceive that they are receiving outcomes greater than what they deserve or have worked for. This experience produces \"inequity\" - - a tension that results from a familiarity with the basic social norm that indicates that each person receives what he deserves. Inequity often produces a fear that one will be retaliated against for having defied the norm. To reduce this feeling of inequity, a person can follow one of three paths: 1) he can derogate the value of the other person's inputs or 2) he can minimize the other person's inputs or 3) he can deny responsibility for the lack of outcomes that the other person is receiving. The simplest way to reduce inequity feelings is to justify to oneself that the other person deserves the lower outcomes that he or she is receiving. The easiest way this can be done is to make the person appear as a negative or inferior person. Aggressive behavior toward the individual is initiated with this goal in mind. This is most likely to take place when it is least costly and difficult and when it is most likely to maximize the person's outcomes. Prejudice and discrimination are explained very well by the equity theory of aggression.

Catharsis refers to the process of releasing aggressive energy from a person's system and can be controlled by channeling it into more productive or neutral outlets.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThose who feel that aggression is a drive--a state of excitation that will not subside until its cause is removed--believe that the elimination of aggression depends upon a person's ability to drain orcathartthe aggressive energy from his or her system. There is a certain amount of empirical evidence to support this theory that an anger drive will not subside unless it is released through some aggressive activity.Hokanson and Shelter (1961) conducted an experiment in which subjects were insulted and angered and then allowed to either shock the insulter or do nothing. Heart rate and blood pressure measures were taken for all subjects. Those who were allowed to shock the insulter had readings equal to the pre-insult level, while those who were not allowed any aggressive behavior retained high blood pressure and heartbeat readings. Catharsis theorists believe that aggression can be minimized and channeled into more productive or neutral outlets than retaliating against the cause of the frustration. This is due to the belief that aggressive energy can also be displaced onto another object. Aggressive sports, chopping wood, hammering nails, pounding meat or kneading bread are all examples of activities that can release a certain amount of aggressive energy. This theory is quite popular with non-psychologists and has also been substantiated with experimental evidence. Dobb and Wood (1972) had their subjects insulted by a confederate. The subjects were then given the opportunity to shock someone else or were not permitted to shock anyone. Then the subjects were given the opportunity to shock the person who had insulted them. Those that had shocked someone else shocked the confederate significantly less than those who were permitted no aggressive behavior. There is also some evidence to support the contention that aggressive energy can be released vicariously through observing someone else aggress against the source of one's frustration. This idea is carried over into support for violence on television and in the mass media as a means of reducing generalized aggressive tendencies. The data supporting this approach is by no means definitive and further research is required before theadvocationof violence as a means of reducing violence can be scientifically supported, especially because there exists so much evidence demonstrating that viewing aggression tends to increase aggressive acts.",

Culture is a source of social influence as it determines one's genetic makeup.\nC.             Culture is a source of social influence as it provides people with a number of ready-made answers for crucial life problems, dictates routine relationships and social arrangements, and gives an entire group of people a means of coping with the world.\nD. Culture is a source of social influence because it dictates individual preferences.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIn any human society humans are bound to their culture for a coherentoutlook and approach to life. The essential aspects of a particularculture are precisely what differentiate one segment of humanity fromanother. One need only to travel to a part of the world in which a languageother than one's native tongue is spoken to observe and experiencethe extent of cultural differences. Oddly enough, in order to seethe way in which our culture influences us, it is generally necessary to experienceanother culture. A culture provides people with a number of ready-made answers forcrucial life problems. It dictates the routine relationships and social arrangementsfor survival needs and the protection and raising of the young. It gives an entire group of people a means of coping with the world. Perhaps one of the most subtle, and at the same time one of the mostpervasive, influences of culture on the individual is the shared perspectiveor outlook that it gives members of the same culture. The perceptions, attitudes and values of a society's members are assumed by thatsociety to be objective or universally accepted, although this attitude mightnot be openly expressed. Through processes of communication, individuals acquire a sense ofcommon meaning and purpose which contributes strongly to a particularway of life. In any society, for instance, there are cultural dictatesregarding age and sex. American society, unlike many other societiestends to be oriented toward youth, and does not generally hold thosewho are older in high regard merely because of their age. Also, despitethe efforts of equal rights legislation, there is a widespread expectancythat a nurse or a secretary should be female, and despite the factthat a high proportion of physicians in many Western cultures are women, in our own society we tend to think of this as a male role. Most cultures believe that the earth is round. But there are vast differencesin belief about the nature of God, the type of government that isbest, the manner in which children should be raised and educated, and thestyle of inter-personal relations. We rarely realize how much we suffer from\"cultural provincialism\" in our attitudes and views toward the various aspectsof our lives. Since communication is a central feature of culture, it is mainly throughprocesses of communication that social values, attitudes and perceptionsare transmitted through succeeding generations. This social realitythat is passed along through the family and education system influencesan individual's ways of thinking and acting and can have the effectof very much limiting the type of life a person leads. Travel, the growthof mass media and higher education all contribute to the expansion ofthe limitations a particular culture can place on its members. Today throughoutthe world the phenomenon of \"westernization\" can be seen takingplace. Effected mainly by the mass media, it is no longer uncommonto find a fast-food McDonald's in the midst of Paris, which long representeda culture that would accept no shortcuts to the production of finefood, nor is it unusual to see men and women throughout Western Europe in blue jeans and cowboy boots.Culture, however, is more deeply ingrainedthan the external forms of clothing and dining habits, and to truly understanda man's behavior it is necessary to have an awareness of the valuesand attitudes that have become part of his psychological field through his years of experience with his particular culture.",

Oddly enough, in order to seethe way in which our culture influences us, it is generally necessary to experienceanother culture. A culture provides people with a number of ready-made answers forcrucial life problems. It dictates the routine relationships and social arrangementsfor survival needs and the protection and raising of the young. It gives an entire group of people a means of coping with the world. Perhaps one of the most subtle, and at the same time one of the mostpervasive, influences of culture on the individual is the shared perspectiveor outlook that it gives members of the same culture. The perceptions, attitudes and values of a society's members are assumed by thatsociety to be objective or universally accepted, although this attitude mightnot be openly expressed. Through processes of communication, individuals acquire a sense ofcommon meaning and purpose which contributes strongly to a particularway of life. In any society, for instance, there are cultural dictatesregarding age and sex. American society, unlike many other societiestends to be oriented toward youth, and does not generally hold thosewho are older in high regard merely because of their age. Also, despitethe efforts of equal rights legislation, there is a widespread expectancythat a nurse or a secretary should be female, and despite the factthat a high proportion of physicians in many Western cultures are women, in our own society we tend to think of this as a male role. Most cultures believe that the earth is round. But there are vast differencesin belief about the nature of God, the type of government that isbest, the manner in which children should be raised and educated, and thestyle of inter-personal relations. We rarely realize how much we suffer from\"cultural provincialism\" in our attitudes and views toward the various aspectsof our lives. Since communication is a central feature of culture, it is mainly throughprocesses of communication that social values, attitudes and perceptionsare transmitted through succeeding generations. This social realitythat is passed along through the family and education system influencesan individual's ways of thinking and acting and can have the effectof very much limiting the type of life a person leads. Travel, the growthof mass media and higher education all contribute to the expansion ofthe limitations a particular culture can place on its members. Today throughoutthe world the phenomenon of \"westernization\" can be seen takingplace. Effected mainly by the mass media, it is no longer uncommonto find a fast-food McDonald's in the midst of Paris, which long representeda culture that would accept no shortcuts to the production of finefood, nor is it unusual to see men and women throughout Western Europe in blue jeans and cowboy boots.Culture, however, is more deeply ingrainedthan the external forms of clothing and dining habits, and to truly understanda man's behavior it is necessary to have an awareness of the valuesand attitudes that have become part of his psychological field through his years of experience with his particular culture."

As an example of thistype of study consider a psychologist who wishes to observe language developmentand uses a single child as his subject over a number of years. This would be considered a longitudinal study. A cross-sectional study is one in which different subjects at different developmentallevels are compared. For example, instead of using a longitudinalapproach, a researcher could investigate language developmentby comparing the linguistic ability of different groups of childrenat different stages of development. The obvious advantage of a cross-sectional study over a longitudinalstudy is that it is much less time-consuming. But there are occasionswhen a longitudinal approach is necessary. For example, if a researcherwants to determine whether intelligence test scores change withage or remain stable, he could best accomplish this using a longitudinalstudy of a single individual (or group) where he could observe theindividual at different periods over a number of years. He could not do thisusing a cross-sectional study. In addition there is sometimes a problemin interpreting cross-sectional data. For example were we to studypossible changes in intelligence test scores with age by the cross-sectionalmethod, we would assume that the \"older\" group in our sampleonce had test scores which were comparable to our \"younger\" group. This, of course, may be an erroneous assumption. It is possible thatfor some reason our \"older\" group's test scores were once significantlyhigher or lower than our \"younger\" group.

Aggression develops from infancy through temper tantrums, influenced by parental behavior and societal situations, then evolves into more complex forms during childhood and adolescence, often as a result of frustration and societal pressures.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nDuring infancy, aggressive behavior is evident in temper tantrums. These tantrums may be caused by: adult pressure, exhibited in strict toilet training; loss of attention, which is especially apparent upon the birth of a younger sibling; and excessive stimulation, which occurs when the infant is fatigued. As the child becomes older, the example set by the parents' behaviorbecomes a critical factor in determining his degree of aggressiveness. Children who observe frequent and violent outbursts in theirparents will develop aggressive behavior. In addition, parental inconsistency, with regard to punishment leads to aggressive behavior in children. A parent who disapproves of physical aggression yet uses it to punishthe child is likely to produce aggression in the child. Permissive parentswho resort to physical punishment also produce aggression in children. During the preschool period, aggression most often arises from socialconflicts that occur during cooperative play. At this time, the child is unclearabout the difference between accidental and intentional aggression. His egocentric mode of thinking might lead him to believe an accidentalpush was deliberate and he will strike back. As he matures he beginsto learn this distinction. Physical aggression usually decreases with increasing age while verbalaggression increases. Boys have been found to be more aggressive than girls in this society. This factor is due, in large part, to the cultural stereotypes that designateacceptable masculine and feminine behavior. In studying the relationship between childhood aggression and futurebehavioral development,Kaganand Moss (1962) found that childrenfrom three to six years of age who were dominant, competitive, andindirectly aggressive toward their peers, tended to be particularly competitiveas adults. During middle childhood and adolescence, aggression is the result offrustration. It can assume several forms such as rebelling against a figureof authority or engaging in vandalism. The aggressive behavior can bedirected against either the person or the object that causes the frustration, or it can be displaced to another person or object. For example, a child who bullies a younger sibling may be giving vent to frustrationcaused by parents who are too strong for him to fight. The adolescent may suffer from two basic sources of frustration. One of these is the identity crisis where the adolescent has trouble determininghis role. The other source includes the sense of depression thatarises when he becomes aware of the difference that exists between hisactual living situation and the situation in which he would like to live. In thissociety, a physically mature adolescent must continue to depend upon hisparents for economic support because of the cultural demands of schooling. The adolescent's desire to live his life as he pleases without the restrictionsof parental dictates, is one of the most common causes of adolescentaggression in this culture.",

Therefore, this type of \"second-order\" drive did not have a direct physiological basis, yet it was built upon and determined by \"first-order\" or physiological drives.

He assumes that themost favorable possible conditions will occur and makes decisions accordingly. Criterion of Pessimism: This approach is just the opposite of the optimisticstrategy. In this framework, the manager assumes that the worst willhappen and acts accordingly. This approach represents an ultra-conservativeapproach. Generally, it would not be conducive to long-rangegrowth or profit-making.

Probably most managers will be neither totallyoptimistic nor totally pessimistic in their forecasting of the future.

The combination of punishment and extinction speeds up behavior change\nC.             Punishment and extinction work synergistically to eliminate behaviors\nD. The use of punishment in conjunction with extinction may actually decrease the effectiveness of the extinction procedure.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nExtinction and punishment are used with varying success to eliminateparticular behaviors. Extinction can operate in both classical and operantconditioning situations. In the former, it involves the presentation ofthe conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus. In the latter, a learned response is no longer reinforced. Punishment involves the administrationof an unpleasant stimulus following a certain behavior. One mightassume that extinction and punishment, if used together, would be moreeffective in the elimination of behaviors than either one used alone. Experimental evidence has shown that this is not the case. Consider a typical escape training procedure. An apparatus that containsa starting box, runway, and goal box is used. A gate separates thestarting box from the runway. When the gate opens, a shock is deliveredfrom the floor of the starting box and the runway. There is no shockin the goal box. A rat placed in the starting box of such an apparatuswill learn to run out of that box when the gate opens, then down therunway until it reaches the goal box. Thus, the animal learns to escape theshock. To extinguish this escape response, the experimenter can cease shockingthe animal when the gate is opened. The first few times that the gateis opened and no shock is administered, the rat will run to the goal. This is because the open gate has been paired with the unconditioned stimulus(shock), resulting in the opened gate be-coming a conditioned stimulus. (Running to the goal box is the unconditioned response.) When theconditioned stimulus is presented, it will elicit a conditioned response (runningto the goal). After a few trials, however, if the unconditioned stimulusis not present, the conditioned response will be eliminated. Suppose that, while the conditioned response is being extinguished, the animal is also being punished for running into the goal compartment. In such a situation, the gate would open, and the rat would notreceive a shock. As it entered the goal compartment, he would be shocked. It would seem logical to assume that the elimination of the runningbehavior would be more rapid, that there would be an additive effectbetween the two procedures. This is not necessarily the case. In fact, it has been found that under certain conditions, the use of punishmentin conjunction with extinction may actually decrease the effectivenessof the extinction procedure. This is just one of the many difficultiesthat have been found in the use of punishment as a technique ofbehavior change.",

Suppose that, while the conditioned response is being extinguished, the animal is also being punished for running into the goal compartment. In such a situation, the gate would open, and the rat would notreceive a shock. As it entered the goal compartment, he would be shocked. It would seem logical to assume that the elimination of the runningbehavior would be more rapid, that there would be an additive effectbetween the two procedures. This is not necessarily the case. In fact, it has been found that under certain conditions, the use of punishmentin conjunction with extinction may actually decrease the effectivenessof the extinction procedure. This is just one of the many difficultiesthat have been found in the use of punishment as a technique ofbehavior change."

This means that there is one universal, all- encompassing drive. According to Rogers, the one drive is the desire to \"actualize, maintain, and enhance the experiencing organism.\" The basic tendency is to grow and to expand oneself especially by welcoming new experiences. To actualize means to have a person's real self or essence emerge and to replace any false aspects of his personality. A person's real self includes latent desires and disguised proclivities. A homosexual is self-actualized when he recognizes and accepts his attraction to members of his own sex and acts to fulfill his homosexual inclinations. Obviously, there are often differences between one's self- image (heterosexuality, for example) and one's organismic experience (homosexuality, for example). Both the self and the organism are driven to self-actualize at the same time. The individual must clearly perceive and adequately symbolize choices. Otherwise, he will not be able to discriminate between progressive and regressive ways of behaving; this is essential to achieving the goal of actualization. There is an important cognitive element involved in the drive to actualize. The individual must have some knowledge before he can choose but when he does acquire the knowledge he always chooses to grow rather than to regress. There is no biological necessity requiring the individual to progress. Rogers speaks of \"needs as experienced;\" these needs are all subservient to the basic striving of the organism to maintain and enhance itself. However, he places special emphasis on two needs; the need for positive regard and the need for self-regard. Both are learned needs. Positive regard refers to the positive assessment an individual receives from other people; the need for positive regard develops in infancy as a result of the love and care a baby receives. The need for self-regard is established as a result of receiving positive regard from others. These two needs are not always in congruence and can therefore interfere with the actualizing tendency. There are two tendencies to actualizes one to actualize the organism and another to self-actualize. If the self-image and the organism are in congruence then the actualizing tendency remains unified. Otherwise, the self- actualizing tendency and the tendency to actualize the organism may each work to the detriment of the other.",

The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe stage of formal operations is the final step in Piaget's system of cognitivedevelopment. It begins at about the age of 11 when the child beginsto free himself from the concrete. He acquires the ability to think aboutthings which are not linked to actual perceptual experiences. His intellectualability is no longer bound by concrete operations as it was in theprevious stage. He can imagine hypothetical states and he realizes thatthere are many possible solutions to a problem. His thinking becomes increasinglypropositional, logical, and idealistic. A proposition is a verbal statement that is either true or false. Such statementsneed not be linked to reality. A proposition can also be a hypothesis- a prediction or a possible explanation for some phenomenon. In propositional thought, the adolescent can consider at once all the possibleways of solving a problem. This ability is fully attained at about theage of 14 or 15. When presented with a particular problem, the adolescentisolates its elements and methodically explores various approachesto its solution. To study this process, Inhelder and Piaget (1958) asked a group of 10-year-olds and a group of 14-year-olds what combinationof four different chemicals would produce yellow liquid when acatalyst chemical (potassium iodide) was added. Most 10-year-olds respondedby combining only pairs of liquid chemicals. When a correct combinationwas found, the 10-year-olds would tell the examiner that they hadfound the solution. It never occurred to most of them that there might bemore than one correct solution. The 14-year-olds, on the other hand, sawa wide range of combinations. They combined tubes of chemicals by two's, three's, and four's, until they found a whole range of solutions to the problem. By visualizing and actualizing all possibilities, an individual reachesthe level of formal operations. His thinking becomes hypothetical anddeductive. Through the use of propositional thinking, an individual can solve thefollowing problem: If Jack has more oranges than Bill, but less oranges thanSam, who has the most oranges? A pre-adolescent child would have difficultywith this type of problem since it is removed from the realm of concreteperception. During adolescence, thinking becomes scientific. The adolescent followsthe steps of the scientific method which include: formulation of a hypothesisbased on certain evidence; critical evaluation of the hypothesis; experimentation; final selection and testing; reporting of results; and conclusion(s). Before adolescence, the child is not capable of thinkingin such an organized, systematic way. The period of formal operations is also characterized by the developmentof idealism. This idealism relates to the adolescent's ability to dealwith the hypothetical - to ponder and compare the real with the possible. Idealism reflects a concern with ideas or ideals over reality. Often this idealism can create a state of discontent as the individual sees howthe real world fails to meet his standards of an ideal world. Adolescent idealism is related to moral development as defined by Kohlberg.The adolescent acquires self- accepted principles with the attainmentof formal operations. This attainment is the highest level of morality. The formation of self-accepted principles is not possible before thestage of formal operations.

Methods include deduction, induction, and analogy.\nC.             Methods include hypothesis testing, qualitative analysis, and correlation studies.\nD. The major methods of psychology are: the individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, and experimentation.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nPsychologists use several methods to study behavior. The method used depends on the type of behavior under investigation. The major methods of psychology are: the individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, and experimentation. In the individual case study or the case history method, a single individual is examined intensively in order to examine a problem or issue relevant to that person. This method is often used in the assessment and correction of abnormal behavior patterns. In a case study, the psychologist often uses a number of procedures such as collecting biographical data on the individual, administering psychological tests, and conducting interviews with the subject. Sigmund Freud used the individual case study method of investigation. Naturalistic observation refers to the systematic observation of a certain event or phenomenon in the environment as it occurs naturally, without any intervention on the part of the investigator. The researcher avoids manipulation if he believes that it would adversely affect the basic characteristics of the particular phenomenon. If laboratory investigation interferes with the natural occurrence of the phenomenon, then the psychologist would prefer to witness it in its natural environment. For example, certain behavior patterns of monkeys such as mating behavior, might differ in a laboratory setting. Hence, the psychologist would try to observe this behavior as it occurs in the monkeys' natural habitat. Numerous psychological tests have been designed to assess certain aspects of behavior. These tests attempt to measure such factors as intelligence, anxiety, and leadership ability. All of these tests consist of a number of questions. When the test is graded, the person receives a composite score which should reflect his typical behavior in normal circumstances. As previously stated, the interview is used in conjunction with the case study method. Interviews may be structured or unstructured. Structured interviews, in which individuals are asked to respond to a number of pre-formulated questions, are most often given when the psychologist wants to collect information from a group of people. An unstructured interview is usually used in the intensive study of an individual. Here the direction of the interview is guided by the individual's responses and the examiner's hypotheses concerning the underlying rationale of these responses. Surveys are similar to psychological tests and interviews in that individuals are asked to reply to a series of questions or items. In a survey, however, the purpose is not to test or analyze a specific aspect of a person or group. The surveyor wishes to learn an opinion, attitude, or belief on a particular issue. Newspapers and public opinion polls conduct surveys to obtain the public consensus on a certain topic. In experimentation, the psychologist examines a specific phenomenon in a controlled laboratory environment. Here, he can rule out all extraneous and distracting variables and manipulate, with precise equipment and procedures, the conditions he wishes to examine. In experimentation, the researcher examines cause and effect relationships between a changing variable and a certain behavior. For example, if a psychologist wishes to examine the effect of early isolation on social development, he might place a monkey in isolation during the first few years of its life. The monkey would be placed in a controlled environment. The animal would receive everything necessary for physical survival, but it would not come into contact with other monkeys. After a certain number of years, the monkey would be placed in a cage with other monkeys who were not deprived as he was. The psychologist would then note the animal's reactions. Hence, the psychologist is attempting to determine the effect of a variable--early isolation--upon a certain behavior--social interaction.",

Affective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms, and can be categorized into depressed, manic, or bipolar. They are further divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical affective disorders in DSM III.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAffective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms. Mood is defined as a prolonged emotion which colors the whole psychic life and generally involves either depression or elation. In DSM III, nearly all of the subtypes of affective disorders are divided according to twonosological(medical classification) dimensions each one having three divisions. The firstnosologicaldimension in thesubclassificationof affective disorders has to do with the predominant mood displayed by the patient. In affective disorders, mood tends to be at one extreme or the other. The patient may be depressed, or he may be manic, or he may exhibit bipolar symptoms--that is, he may alternate between the extremes of depression and mania. Symptoms of depression include loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure in sexual activities, feelings of self-reproach, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Some manic symptoms are hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, loquacity (talkativeness), inflated self-esteem, and excessive involvement in activities without regard to their painful consequences (e.g., buying sprees, foolish business investments, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving). Another symptom of mania is \"flight of ideas,\" which refers to rapid shifts in conversation from one subject to another based on superficial associations. It can be seen, then, that patients with affective disorders may be classified as depressed, manic, or bipolar, depending on which kinds of mood-related symptoms they manifest. The secondnosologicaldimension along which affective disorders are subdivided has to do with the onset of the patient's disorder. This dimension is divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical affective disorders. The essential feature of episodic affective disorders is an episode of illness with a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood which is clearly distinguished from prior functioning. Here the onset of the disorder is relatively clear. As the previous discussion of the three divisions of the mood dimension may suggest, in DSM-III the episodic affective disorders are divided into episodic depressive disorders, episodic manic disorders, and episodic bipolar disorders. Affective disorders are classified as chronic when there is a long-standing (at least two years) illness with either sustained or intermittent disturbance in mood. Chronic disorders usually begin in early adult life without a clear onset or specific cause. Generally, the mood disturbances involved in chronic disorders are more prolonged but not so severe as those manifested in episodic disorders. Like the episodic affective disorders, the chronic affective disorders are grouped along the depressive, manic, and bipolar divisions of the mood dimension and are called, respectively, chronic depressive disorder (depressive personality) , chronichypomanicdisorder (hypomanic personality), andcyclothymicdisorder (cyclothymicpersonality). A chronic depressive disorder is characterized by a feeling of sadness. The depressed mood may be either persistent or intermittent and separated by periods of normal mood. These normal periods may last a few days to a few weeks; a diagnosis of chronic depressive affective disorder is not made if there has been a normal period of two months or more. The symptoms of chronichypomanicdisorder are similar to those mentioned in the description of mania. The disturbance in mood results in the patient being abnormally energetic and expansive. As in chronic depressive disorders, the mood disturbances in chronichypomanic disorders may be persistent, or intermittent with normal periods of mood lasting no longer than two months. The essential feature ofcyclothymicdisorder is a chronic disturbance involving numerous periods during which there are some symptoms characteristic of both the depressive and manic syndromes but not of sufficient severity to meet the criteria for a depressive or manic episode. The manifestations of the two syndromes may be separated by periods of normal mood lasting as long as several months. In some cases the two syndromes are intermixed, or they may alternate. The category of atypical disorders, which is subdivided into atypical depressive disorders, atypical manic disorders, and atypical bipolar disorders, is a residual category used for classifying individuals who do not fit into the episodic or chronic categories. An example of an atypical affective disorder is an illness which fulfills the criteria for a chronic depressive disorder, except that there have been intermittent periods of normal mood lasting more than two months.",

                "solution": "Affective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms. Mood is defined as a prolonged emotion which colors the whole psychic life and generally involves either depression or elation. In DSM III, nearly all of the subtypes of affective disorders are divided according to twonosological(medical classification) dimensions each one having three divisions. The firstnosologicaldimension in thesubclassificationof affective disorders has to do with the predominant mood displayed by the patient. In affective disorders, mood tends to be at one extreme or the other. The patient may be depressed, or he may be manic, or he may exhibit bipolar symptoms--that is, he may alternate between the extremes of depression and mania. Symptoms of depression include loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure in sexual activities, feelings of self-reproach, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Some manic symptoms are hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, loquacity (talkativeness), inflated self-esteem, and excessive involvement in activities without regard to their painful consequences (e.g., buying sprees, foolish business investments, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving).

Problems in the interview, sampling problems, and generality of the data\nD. Lack of peer review\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nKinsey's research on American sexual customs during the 1940's and 1950's was critically received largely, perhaps, because of The controversial nature of the reports. The three major criticisms centered on: 1) problems in the interview, 2) sampling problems, and 3) generality of The data. There are four criticisms of the Kinsey's interview techniques. The first being that each interviewer was free to rephrase questions and probe at his own discretion. Because of such latitude in interview procedure, interviewers did not always produce comparable data. It appears that differences in the behavior of the interviewers produced significantly different answers from the respondents. A second concern was that all interviewers for both studies were male. It has often been found that the sex of the interviewer has an effect on what the respondent will be willing to report. For example, more sexual experiences are reported when the interviewer and respondent are of the same gender. A third criticism was that respondent's self reports may have been biased, for example towards attempting to appear normal and to avoid disapproval. The fourth concern was that some questions required that the respondent report retrospectively concerning their adolescence. As a result the reports may have been subject to the distortions that time and experience may impose on memory. The second major criticism of the reports concerned possible sampling deficiencies. Through lectures and public relations efforts, various groups were asked to participate in the study, but not every member of the groups came to these meetings. In the male sample of sixty-two groups it was found that members of forty-two of these groups had generally attended college. This suggests greater willingness among men who have attended college to participate in a study involving potential embarrassment. But the manner in which the data was reported precludes an assessment of the effects of this greater willingness to participate found among better educated groups. Another problem with the sampling was the intentional exclusion of nonwhites. Properly speaking, the reports refer to white Americans. The third criticism of the reports concerned thegeneralizabilityof the data. Kinsey made sweeping conclusions about men based on responses of less than two hundred individuals. Kinsey also made numerous highly complex interpretations and evaluations, some of them very prescriptive but often unsupported by the data. For example, of the 179 males who engaged in the least amount of sexual activity, Kinsey asserted that 52.5 percent of all American males were timid or inhibited individuals, afraid of their own self condemnation if they were to engage in any sort of sexual activity.",

Four basic models of aggression reduction are punishment, punishment of aggressive models, reward of alternative behavior, and the presence of non-aggressive models.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are four basic models of aggression reduction which are commonly in use: punishment, punishment of aggressive models, reward of alternative behavior, and the presence of non-aggressive models. Punishment is probably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of how to reduce unwanted behavior. Research and observation show severe punishment to be usually temporary in effect and not conducive to the internalization of the desired behavior. Research shows that children who are reared by strict punishment usually grow up to be aggressive. This has generally been attributed to the frustrating effect of severe punishment. Mild punishment is a far more effective tool for reducing aggression. The second model of aggression reduction is punishment of aggressive models. The underlying theory here is that a person who views another person getting punished for a certain behavior will be vicariously punished as well. (Possibly the idea behind public executions.) However, in small group experiments with children, observation of a model being punished for aggression did not lower the general level of aggression below that of a control group which did not observe such punishment. The third approach to the reduction of aggressive behavior is the rewarding of alternative behavior patterns. This requires ignoring a child when he behaves aggressively and rewarding him when he displays non-aggressive behavior. Although best suited for children, this method sometimes works well with adults, and is based on the idea that the individual is behaving in an aggressive manner to attract attention. The research in this area is highly supportive of this approach. The main success of this method is that it clearly demonstrates that it is possible to train children to respond to frustration in non-aggressive ways. The fourth and final approach is the presence of non-aggressive models. This is almost a combination of methods 2 and 3 in that it combines the best of both. The supplying of knowledge to the extent that a certain behavior, if acted, would be considered inappropriate, is a powerful control of aggression. By presenting an individual with a situation in which non-controlled people act non-aggressively, the rate of aggressive behavior will drop. This view has been repeatedly supported by research.",

Freudian therapist would use cognitive restructuring, while behaviorist might use aversion therapy.\nD. Freudian therapist would use medication, while behaviorist might use mindfulness-based therapies.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are a number of common phobias. Phobias are intense and irrationalfears of particular situations or objects that are recognized by the individualand others to be inherently harmless. For a fear to be considereda neurosis requiring treatment it usually must reach incapacitatingproportions. Characteristic of neurotic phobic reactions are feelingsof apprehension, heart palpitations, fainting, nausea or fatigue-- sometimes panic may occur if escape from the fearful object or situationis not possible. A widely accepted theory about the origin of phobic reactions comesfrom Freudian thought. It is believed that the phobia represents a displacementof anxiety from its real source to a symbolic object or situation. This displacement activity allows the repressed anxiety an outlet withoutthreatening the psychological balance of the individual by admittingthe true object of the anxiety into consciousness. For example, anxietyassociated with sexual temptations may be transferred to a phobic fearof germ contamination. The specific nature of the phobia allows the individualto monitor his exposure to the fear producing situations. Because the anxiety needs periodic outlets, however, it is necessary that thefeared object be readily available. It is for this reason that common objectsor situations are often selected for fearful reactions--such as high places, open places, germs, crowds, darkness and solitude. \"Agoraphobia\" is fear of open places. Adherents of different schools ofthought concerning human behavior would approach the treatment of thisproblem differently. The Freudian therapist would tend to act from the premisesstated above. The unconscious source of the irrational fear wouldneed to be brought into consciousness so that the individual could examinethe inappropriate responses he was having and come to work out therepressed feelings through his transference relationship with the analyst. Free association, dream analysis and interpretation by the therapistwould all probably be utilized by the Freudian attempting to cure apatient of agoraphobia. A behaviorist, working from a different theoretical basis, would use entirelydifferent techniques. The behavior is would reject the theory that aninner, buried, unconscious problem was the source of the phobia. Behaviorists tend to act from the premise that the symptom being observedis the problem and the main task is to remove the undesirable behavior. The original cause of the symptomatic reaction is seen as irrelevant. The techniques a behaviorist might utilize include desensitization, reinforcement, relaxation, shaping,, and stimulus generalization. In extinguishinga fear of open places the therapist might first ask the person torelax. Once this is accomplished the behaviorist may expose the phobic personto an open space for a very short time. As he does this, he may continuallyask the person to remain calm and give him reinforcement in theform of approval, support and encouragement. At each session the individualwould be exposed for longer periods of time to the open space, eachtime being trained and aided to relax and reinforced positively for relaxation. Eventually, the patient will realize, in the presence of the feared stimulus, that nothing harmful will befall him. Through this process the individual would learn a more adaptive, reasonableresponse to the stimulus of open space. He would be conditionedto respond in a new way; his inappropriate behavior would be modifiedso that it resembled that of a rational adult. Behavior modification iscurrently considered the most effective treatment for phobic reactions.",

Free association, dream analysis and interpretation by the therapistwould all probably be utilized by the Freudian attempting to cure apatient of agoraphobia. A behaviorist, working from a different theoretical basis, would use entirelydifferent techniques. The behavior is would reject the theory that aninner, buried, unconscious problem was the source of the phobia. Behaviorists tend to act from the premise that the symptom being observedis the problem and the main task is to remove the undesirable behavior. The original cause of the symptomatic reaction is seen as irrelevant. The techniques a behaviorist might utilize include desensitization, reinforcement, relaxation, shaping,, and stimulus generalization. In extinguishinga fear of open places the therapist might first ask the person torelax. Once this is accomplished the behaviorist may expose the phobic personto an open space for a very short time. As he does this, he may continuallyask the person to remain calm and give him reinforcement in theform of approval, support and encouragement. At each session the individualwould be exposed for longer periods of time to the open space, eachtime being trained and aided to relax and reinforced positively for relaxation. Eventually, the patient will realize, in the presence of the feared stimulus, that nothing harmful will befall him. Through this process the individual would learn a more adaptive, reasonableresponse to the stimulus of open space. He would be conditionedto respond in a new way; his inappropriate behavior would be modifiedso that it resembled that of a rational adult. Behavior modification iscurrently considered the most effective treatment for phobic reactions."

The effect of this crowding on human beings has not been clearly discerned. Though it is assumed that crowding is bad, there is little hard evidence to prove that this is so. When crowding research began, it was conducted mainly on animals. In these experiments, rats, monkeys, rabbits, and fish all showed pathological behavior as a result of crowding. For example, the rats became hyper aggressive and antisocial, some even died of thirst even though there was a plentiful water supply. These experiments were taken to prove that crowding would produce the same type of bizarre effects in humans. However, the experimentation that has been done on the effects of crowding have yet to prove that this is true. An individual may live in a densely populated area or spend much of his day in a densely populated situation, and still not feel crowded. Density is a physical concept, while crowding is a psychological concept. Density of population does not necessarily lead a person to feel he or she does not have enough space. There is a correlation between density of population and antisocial behavior, but when other factors are controlled for the difference between densely populated and moderately populated areas disappears. The other factors that need to be controlled for are income level and ethnicity. Poor people and minorities tend to live in densely populated areas. When the amount of social pathology in poor ghetto blacks is compared with that of poor blacks in moderately populated areas, the differences are found to be equal despite the density of population. In fact, it has been discovered that delinquency is more correlated with income than density. Because human beings are remarkably adaptable, it may be that dense living conditions can be adapted to in such a way that they do not produce pathological behavior. It is true that in parts of Hong Kong residents have only thirty-five square feet per person and there does not appear to be any unusual degree of social disorder in that city. There are many further experiments that need to be conducted on the effects of crowding before it can be definitely said that it has a negative influence on humans.",

A significant difference signifies that two samples are from the same population.\nD. A significant difference is always due to random variation.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe concept of significant difference arises when statistical inferencesare made. The theory of statistical inference is concerned with predictingpopulation parameters (i.e., characteristics) on the basis of a randomsample selected from the population. Assume that a psychologist is interested in determining the time takenby college students to memorize a list of nonsense syllables. He collectsa sample of students from college A and conducts the experiment. If he repeats the experiment by taking another random sample from collegeB, then the statistics calculated from the samples (a statistic is a numericalfunction of the sample) will almost always vary because of samplingvariability . Here the investigator is faced with a difficulty, namely, what caused thevariability? There are two possible explanations: 1)Thevariation was random(some students may have been sleepy, some may have been uninterestedetc; the word random covers all factors that the investigator cannotcontrol and feels are not important for his particular purpose or interest). In this case, the students from college A and college B belong to thesame population (in terms of ability to memorize nonsense syllables). 2) The two samples come from different populations, i.e., the average time takenby students in college A is different from that of students in college B. The investigator must decide, on the basis of the difference in samples, whether 1) or 2) is true. If the difference is so large that it would rarelyoccur because of sampling variability alone, this difference signifies thatthe two samples are from different populations (meaning simply differingon an identifiable dimension, here perhaps a representative group ofvery bright students enrolled in college A (which is a prestigious institution) and another population of not so bright students representative ofstudents at college B). Such a large difference is called a significant difference. Other examples of samples that may produce significant differencesare the following: 1) A random sample of American males and a random sample of American females will usually show a significant difference in height. This meansthat males and females belong to two different populations as far asheight is concerned, i.e., they are normally distributed with different means. 2) Two random samples of daily traffic accidents in two major American cities may or may not show a significant difference. If the samplesdo indeed belong to different populations, the populations will be \"Poisson distributed\" with different means (comparatively rare events such astraffic accidents or number of misprints in a book are elements of populationswhose probabilities are given by the Poisson distribution whichis a distribution with a high frequency of one or a few of the events ofinterest and a decreasing frequency of more than a few events, etc.). Just how large a difference must be in order to qualifyas \"significant\" depends on the sample size and how certain the investigator mustbe before he is willing to admit that the difference is meaningful and notrandom.

Standardization of a test means making it harder for students\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nStandardization of a test implies that there is a uniformity of procedurein administering and scoring the test. Without standardization it isimpossible to compare the test results of different individuals. Every aspectof the test and the testing environment must be strictly controlled. Thus, there must be detailed instructions for administering the test, includingtime limits, oral instructions, and methods of answering students' questions. In a test situation, the examiner wants there to be only one independentvariable--the individual being tested; otherwise, he cannot be certainthat the difference in test scores among individuals is attributable totrue individual differences rather than to chance factors in the testing environment. For instance, perhaps an individual receives a higher score onthe SAT because the exam proctor allowed more time for the test's completionthan is normally allowed. The method of scoring a standardized test is also strictly controlled. This is one reason why the College Board tests have only multiplechoice questions. In the case of multiple choice questions, scoring is quick, simple, and objective. It is almost impossible to satisfactorily standardize anessay question test especially if the test is nationwide. It cannot be expectedthat two graders will evaluate an essay in exactly the same way. (There are, however, ways to minimize the problems of essay scoring by providingprecise outlines of what the scorer should look for in an answer.) When an individual takes a test, a spelling test for example, he receivesa raw score; in the case of a spelling test the raw score will probablybe the number of words spelled correctly. This raw score has no objectivevalue. Not only is it necessary to know how many words there areon the test (15 out of 30 words spelled correctly is better than 5 out of 30 words spelled correctly; i.e., percentages a more useful for test evaluationthan raw scores) in order to evaluate the raw score but it is also necessaryto know how everyone else in this individual's category or \"comparisongroup\" (age, grade, educational level, field of specialization, culturalbackground) has done. That is, a norm must be established. If the individualgot a raw score of 30 (out of 60 words) and the average performanceis 55 words correct, he did relatively poorly. However, if he gota raw score of 30 and the average performance of people in his categoryis 12 words correct, he did relatively well. A test score can only beinterpreted in relation to a norm. On nationwide tests that are eventually administered to millions of peopleit is necessary to establish national norms.A standardization samplethat is statistically representative of the population that will eventuallybe taking the test is tested and the norms for the test are in referenceto this sample, the mean score for this sample is considered to bethe average score for the population. All of the statistical information aboutthe test is usually in reference to the performance of the standardizationsample. Of course, statisticians are always interested in howwell a new sample's performance compares to the performance of the originalstandardization sample. It is very important, especially on intelligencetests, not to judge an individual's performance on a test by the establishednorms if the individual is not represented in a standardization sample. For example, a Black person's IQ according to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) cannot be evaluated if there were no Blacks in theoriginal standardization sample. One of the major criticisms of the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI), a personality test usednationally, is that since the original standardization sample consisted largelyof male, white farmers from rural Minnesota in the 1950's, the normsestablished are not applicable to the general population. Norms are the only way to evaluate tests. The idea of absolute scoreshaving absolute values (that is, 90 out of 100 is always a good score) is often untenable. A person's test score is good or bad only in relationto how everyone else does on the test.",

It also raises the question of whata test score reveals about an individual; will the test score help the examinerto understand the examinee by providing meaningful informationabout his personality or intellectual characteristics? Construct validity is a complex and often elusive concept. It is difficultto understand fully what a psychological construct is. A psychologicalconstruct is a word or term that represents a set of consistentdata about a person. It is an inferred conception of a person. Psychological constructs help to organize a person's behavior into meaningfulcategories. Intelligence is a psychological construct. There is nobehavior which can be defined as intelligence. Intelligence is inferred; it isused to explain why some people do better than other people on specifictests. People often do not agree on what intelligence is because peopledo not agree on what tasks require intelligence. Like all psychologicalconstructs, intelligence has no tangible existence; it accountsfor a cluster of behaviors but is not itself a behavior. It is neither asystem nor a process. In essence a construct is a description of an assumedunderlying relationship among a group of hypothetically related behaviors. Thus an intelligence test does not really measure intelligence but measuresa person's ability to perform certain tasks which the examiner believesrequire intelligence (the underlying construct which describes howthe various tasks are related). In order to evaluate construct validity it isnecessary to determine what behaviors are theoretically consistent with theconstruct being measured. For instance, if a test was designed to measurethe strength of an individual's motivation to achieve (achievementmotivation) , the test results should be consistent with a theoryof achievement motivation. Thus, a person who scores high on achievementmotivation ought to do well in college (in relation to his scholasticaptitude). If he does not do well in college one of two things mustbe true. Either the test has poor construct validity and does not measureachievement motivation or the theory of achievement motivation isinaccurate; perhaps there is no such thing as \"achievement motivation.\" When an examiner wishes to assess the construct validity of a test he mustdo so in accordance with a theory of human behavior. The test score shouldbe able to predict behavior in accordance with a particular theory. Correlationalanalysis is the usual procedure for determining construct validity. The nature of the trait or construct indicates what other measures thetest should be related to. A newly developed group intelligence test shouldcorrelate highly with the old, individually administered, Stanford-Binet.The test should not only correlate positively with other testswhich are assumed to measure the same trait or construct, but ideallyit should also have no significant correlation with tests that do not measurethese traits. These two processes are referred to as convergent validationanddiscriminantvalidation, respectively. In accordance with a theory a test with construct validity should supportpredictions of group differences. College students should score higheron a test of achievement motivation than high-school dropouts (discriminantvalidity). A test with construct validity should also support theoreticalpredications about response to experimental treatments or interventions. An individual who takes a test designed to measure anxiety shouldhave a higher score following an anxiety-inducing session than otherwise(convergent validity).",

Roles are the tasks assigned to individuals in a group\nD. Roles are the titles given to individuals in a group\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nGenerally, a group's primary purpose is to achieve some definite goal. To accomplish the goal, positions are established. A \"position\" is simply where a person falls in the group's hierarchy. \"Roles\" are the different behaviors an individual displays in connection with a given social position. Therefore, there are behaviors associated with the role of father, the role of employer, the role of student, the role of secretary, the role of teacher. Most people have a multiplicity of roles which must be filled each day. However, people who occupy the same type of position may play very different roles. Three different roles are possible in any given position in a group depending on the function performed. The \"task-oriented\" role requires that a person be concerned directly with accomplishing the goal of the group. He relates to people by initiating discussions, seeking opinions and information, organizing activities and directing the group toward the aim. The \"maintenance\" role requires that the individual playing it be more concerned with the group morale. This person will attend to the personal needs of the group members, including the psychological and emotional needs. The final type of role is the \"self-oriented\" role; the person who takes this role cares mainly for himself and may even attempt to undermine the goals of the group as a whole if it interferes with his personal desires or needs. Take a family as an example of a typical group. The father traditionally plays the task-oriented role. He is mainly concerned with seeing that the family is protected and well-cared for physically and financially. The mother plays the maintenance role tending more to the emotional needs of the family, while the children more often play a self-oriented role, looking out for their own interests, with minor concern about the goals of the family as a whole.

Success leads to negative results\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nAt Harvard in the early 1970's,MatinaHorner set about studying the attitudes of both men and women to successful members of their own sex in traditionally male-dominated occupations. She did this by administering one-line beginning descriptive phrases and having her subjects complete a story about the person described. The stories were scored in terms of the consequences of success for the people in the story. An example of a typical story beginning is, \"Anne finds herself in her last year of medical school at the top of her class,\" and \"Andrew finds himself in his last year of medical school at the top of his class.\" About 65% of the women believed that success would lead to negative results for the women described, while less than 10% of the men described negative results for the successful men. From these results she postulated the need to avoid success in women, and later found that it was particularly prevalent in bright women. Because of societal expectations that a woman will not do as well as a man, will marry and occupy a position to complement him, it was felt that women were in a double-bind situation, that is, in a situation in which they would lose out regardless of which choice they made. In this case, the choice would be whether to maintain the approval of their peers, and particularly of the males whom they would be threatening with their high-level intellectual performance, by performing at a level lower than their capacity, or to do their best academically and professionally and alienate those around them with their \"unfeminine\" behavior. Because of this double-bind situation, Horner theorized that bright women suffer from a motive to avoid success in occupational and intellectual pursuits in order to insure success in emotional and relational pursuits. Subsequent experimentation, however, has shown that both men and women feel that a woman who is successful in a traditionally male-dominated field will encounter negative results. Therefore, her findings may simply reflect the social stereotyping of male and female roles and may not be pointing out a motive pertaining specifically to women.

Three techniques for assessing anxiety are self-report, observation of overt behavior, and employing physiological indices.\nD. Anxiety is assessed using self-introspection, observation, and physiological measurement\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nAnxiety is a crucial concept in the study of abnormal psychology becauseit is considered to be both a symptom and a cause of varying neuroticdisorders. Often acute anxiety is considered a neurotic disorder in andof itself. Since anxiety is so important for the study of abnormal behavior thereis a definite need for a way of measuring it in individuals. Three techniquesare currently available: self-report, observation of overt behavior, and employing physiological indices. In the self-report technique, subjects may offer their own subjective impressionsof anxiety describing their experience in their own needs. Methodologically however, this does not allow for comparison between subjectssince the subjects give very different descriptions and may have verydifferent standards as to what they mean by \"anxious.\" To overcome thesedifficulties researchers developed self-report questionnaires to measureanxiety. The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) is a commonly usedquestionnaire of this type. The statements are taken from the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI), a general personality inventorywith many dimensions. The items which comprise the MAS are thosestatements which correlate highly (negatively or positively) with an independentmeasure of anxiety. Overt behavioral measurement usually involves a trained clinician observinga particular individual's behavior to determine whether or not the individualappears to be anxious. This involves a commonsense, and thereforeunscientific, measure which is difficult to quantify. Examples of whatthe clinician might look for are nail-biting and trembling. Since anxietyinvolves a change in the individual's psychological state, the observermust know what the normal behavior of the individual is (theso-called \"base-rate\" of behavior). An individual who always bites his nailsis not considered to be anxious when he is observed biting his nails. In fact, the nail-biting might be soothing and the cessation of nail-biting mightin itself result in anxiety. Another example of overt behavioral measurementis the observation of a discrepancy between expected and actualperformance. If a student normally does \"A\" work in a class and getsa \"C\" on a test (assuming that the rest of the class does as expected) thenit could be inferred that the student was anxious at the time that he tookthe test. Excessive anxiety usually results in an impairment of performance . Finally, physiological changes are known to occur when a person is anxious. Examples of such physiological changes are increased pulse rate, rapid breathing, and sweating (this corresponds to the arousal of the sympatheticnervous system). Typically, the psychologist will have a base ratemeasurement for an individual's physiological functions. These measurementsare taken in an environment that does not induce anxiety. When a subject is then in an anxiety- inducing situation the meaningful changein the individual 's physiological functions is obtained by comparingthe new measures with the base rates. One of the most importantphysiological measures of anxiety is the galvanic skin response (GSR) which is the change in electric potential across the skin surface. The GSR changes with the increase or decrease in moisture on the skin. Thus palm sweating, a common indication of anxiety, results in an increasedGSR. The GSR is measured by a galvanometer (the famous, or infamouslie detector). Electrodes are taped onto the subject's skin; these electrodesmeasure electrical potential. The electrodes are connected to wireswhich are connected to a machine which records the GSR's on a movingroll of paper with a needle which moves up and down according to theintensity of the GSR. A large jump by the needle indicates a big changein the GSR; for people who are given a lie detector test, this is interpretedas a lie, or at least that they are unusually anxious about answeringthe question. Physiological methods used to measure anxiety do not assess anxietyper se. They actually are measuring certain definable correlates of anxiety. This is because anxiety itself is a psychological \"construct,\" i.e. an inferred, not observable, phenomenon. The measures of anxiety, consideredapart from a specific situation or context, may be meaningless. Rapid heartbeat, for instance, may be an indicator of sexual excitement, not anxiety. Thus, anxiety can be considered a scientific or psychologicalconstruct, useful mainly in organizing data and generating hypotheses. As a construct, it is linked to observable behavioral phenomenaby the methods of assessment discussed above.",

Classification of a schizophrenic into one or another of the subtypes dependsupon how the psychosis developed and/or upon what kinds of symptomsare predominant in the patient's behavior. It is rare to find a schizophrenicwho fits neatly into one of the subcategories of schizophrenia. This discussion will cover the types of schizophrenia listed inDSM-III.

The theory states, basically, that man has many cognitions (attitudes, perceptions) about the world that can have one of three relations to one another. 1) Cognitions can be consonant - - they follow from one another and support behavior related to one another. For example, a woman who enjoys cooking, cooks dinner for her family. 2) The cognitions can be irrelevant to one another. This occurs when, for instance, a woman who enjoys cooking telephones her hairdresser. 3) Finally, cognitions can be dissonant. In this case the behaviors that result from the two cognitions are contradictory or at least do not follow from each other. Suppose that the woman who enjoys cooking hires a cook, this means that she will not be cooking muchany more. This woman will experience a dissonant state. The experience of dissonance is a negative one; it produces a motivational state that aims at reducing the dissonance. The greater the dissonance, the more likely it is that behavior will ensue to reduce the dissonance. There are a number of ways in which dissonance can be reduced, many concern the attitudes of the individual involved.

Fixation and regression refer to psychological defense mechanisms.\nB. Fixation refers to a halting of normal development, whereas regression refers to a return to earlier, less mature stages of development.\nC.             Fixation and regression are stages of normal development.\nD. Fixation refers to rapid development, whereas regression refers to slow development.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nAccording to Freud, fixation and regression are the results of abnormal personality development. In his scheme of personality development consisting of different stages, Freud stated that there is a certain amount of frustration and anxiety as the individual passes from one stage to the next. If the amount of frustration and anxiety becomes too great, that is, if there is too much anxiety about moving to the next stage, development may halt and the individual will become fixated at one stage. An overly dependent child is an example of someone who is fixated. Development has ceased at an early stage of development preventing him from becoming independent. In contrast, regression refers to a retreat to an earlier stage of development. Someone who encounters an intolerable experience and is unable to deal with it may engage in behavior appropriate to someone at an earlier stage of development. Often, regression is used as a means of handling frustration. A six-year-old who reverts to wetting his pants may be expressing his frustration from the loss of parental attention due to the birth of a new sibling. Similarly, a child who displays infantile behavior on his first day of school--crying, thumb sucking, etc. -- is regressing. Regression is usually determined by the earlier fixations of the individual. In other words, the person tends to regress to a stage upon which he has been previously fixated. For example, the child who becomes fixated at a certain stage which results in his overdependence, may become overdependent later in life when faced with an extremely unbearable or frustrating experience. In this case, he is regressing to a point of fixation. It is important to keep in mind that fixation and regression are relative conditions. An individual rarely fixates or regresses completely. Usually most aspects of an individual's personality will mature normally, but his behavior may be characterized by infantilisms--childish conduct which results from frustrations. Fixation and regression are both related to abnormalities in personality development. Fixation refers to a halting of normal development, whereas regression refers to a return to earlier, less mature stages of development.",

For example, the child who becomes fixated at a certain stage which results in his overdependence, may become overdependent later in life when faced with an extremely unbearable or frustrating experience. In this case, he is regressing to a point of fixation. It is important to keep in mind that fixation and regression are relative conditions. An individual rarely fixates or regresses completely. Usually most aspects of an individual's personality will mature normally, but his behavior may be characterized by infantilisms--childish conduct which results from frustrations. Fixation and regression are both related to abnormalities in personality development. Fixation refers to a halting of normal development, whereas regression refers to a return to earlier, less mature stages of development."

The five stages are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the unconscious phase.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nFreud divided the period of motivational development into five stages. These stages are characterized by the objects that are the goals of the individual during each particular stage. Freud believed that the primary driving force in an individual's life was the sexual urge. The stages are therefore especially concerned with representing changes of sexual gratification in relation to the child's body. The five stages in sequential order are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the genital phase. The oral phase begins at birth and lasts eight months. It is characterized by the infant's concern for his mouth and the gratification he seeks from oral stimuli. The most obvious oral activity the child derives pleasure from is eating. Oral stimulation, however, is also produced by engaging in such activities as sucking, biting, swallowing and manipulating various parts of the mouth. Freud contended that these activities are the child's means of fulfilling his sexual urges. Hence, Eros (the life instinct) makes its appearance. But Thanatos (the death instinct) is also seen since quite frequently children destroy objects they come in contact with, often by biting them. During this phase, the child's personality is controlled by the id. He demands immediate gratification of his wants. The next stage of motivational development is the anal phase when the child's central area of bodily concern is the rectum. Bowel movements become a source of pleasure to the child. He may defecate often to achieve this pleasure. This, however, would bring him into conflict with his parents. The conflict leads the child to develop an ego. He comes to realize that he cannot always do what he wants when he wants. He learns that there are certain times when it is appropriate to expel waste and other times when it is inappropriate. He gradually comes to understand his mother's wishes and abides by them. The child's central interest gradually shifts again--this time to the genital region. This stage is called the phallic phase and lasts from approximately two years of age to six. Sexual gratification becomes more erotic during this time as evidenced by the child's masturbation: actual manipulation of the genitals. It is during this stage that the phallus (male genital) acquires a special significance. Freud believed that the increased awareness in' the male of his sexual organs leads him to subconsciously desire his mother. In addition, the male child grows envious and resentful of his father and wishes to replace him as the object of his mother's love. This situation is called the Oedipus Complex. Similarly, a female undergoes a complex wherein she desires her father and rivals with her mother for her father's affections. This is called the Electra Complex. This complex involves penis envy on the part of the female child. She believes that she once had a penis but that it was removed. In order to compensate for its loss, Freud believed the girl wants to have a child by her father. Eventually, however, both the boy and the girl pass through these complexes. Once this happens, they begin to identify with the parent of their own sex. This marks the end of the phallic phase and the beginning of a new one. The next period, the period of latency, is characterized by indifference to sexually related matters. During this time, the child's identification with the parent of his own sex becomes stronger. The child imitates his or her behavior--speech, gestures, mannerisms, as well as beliefs and value systems. The child also incorporates more and more of the beliefs and values of his culture. Thus, the superego is developing to a greater extent. (It began to develop during the late anal and the phallic stages.) The child comes to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in his society. The period of latency is also marked by the fact that children seek associations (or playmates) of their own sex. Boys prefer the company of boys and consciously avoid girls. Girls prefer contact with other girls and avoid boys. This period of sexual latency lasts five years, from ages six to eleven. The final stage of motivational development is called the genital phase, which is the longest of the five stages. It lasts seven years from ages eleven to eighteen. This period is similar to the anal stage. There is a renewed interest and pleasure derived from excretory activity. In addition, masturbation takes place and is engaged in much more frequently at this time than during the anal stage. In the beginning of the genital phase, the person seeks associations with members of his own sex just as in the latency period. But the associations are stronger in the genital phase and Freud believed they are homosexual in nature, even though homosexual activity may not take place. As this period progresses, however, the homosexual tendencies are supplanted by heterosexual ones and toward the latter part of this phase, the child makes contact and forms relationships with members of the opposite sex. Also at this time, the superego undergoes further development and becomes more flexible. In the latency period the superego is quite rigid. The child adopts rules in the most literal sense. During the genital phase, the individual realizes that some rules are less vital than others. Consequently, his behavior will reflect this. He accepts some rules or norms and makes exceptions to others.",

Breach presentation, Cesarean section, use of forceps, effects of pain-killing drugs, and Anoxia\nD. Dehydration, Overeating, Lack of sleep\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nOne complication that may arise during childbirth concerns the position in which the child is born. Normally, a neonate is born head first. Sometimes, however, the child may be born in what is called a breach presentation - when the bottom comes out first. Sometimes the neonate may come out feet first or the umbilical cord may come out alongside the head. The physician takes great care to make sure no complications affect the health and well-being of the child and mother. If a breach presentation occurs and the physician judges the width of the mother's pelvis to be too narrow for a safe birth, he may proceed with a Cesarean section. A Cesarean birth is one in which the child is born by means of a surgical incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus. A Cesarean section might be performed when the head of the fetus is considered too large to easily pass through the birth canal in the mother. In this case, surgical removal might be safer for both mother and child. The physician may use a surgical instrument called forceps to facilitate the delivery. This elongated, tong-like instrument is placed on the baby's head during delivery. The head can be rotated and pulled by the doctor. This procedure is used if the mother is so heavily sedated that she cannot do the pushing necessary for the birth of her child. Most physicians nowadays avoid the use of forceps because past use has resulted in damage to the newborn's head. When presented with a choice, most doctors favor Cesarean sections overforcepuse. For decades, pain-killing drugs have been administered to mothers during labor. So far, no study has indicated that these drugs produce harmful long-term effects on the child. However, some researchers have concluded that the behavior of children, whose mothers took medication during childbirth, is more sluggish during the first few weeks of life. Anoxia is another complication that may arise during childbirth. This, condition refers to a lack of oxygen supplied to the neonate. The condition can be caused by either a rupture of the blood vessels in the brain or by a malfunction in the umbilical cord which prevents it from supplying oxygen to the baby until he is able to breathe on his own. The elimination of umbilical circulation may occur as the result of a number of complications. For example, the cord may become clamped or pinched; oxygen flow may be delayed due to the forcefulness of the contractions, part of the placenta may become separated from the child and/or the mother; or excessive bleeding of the mother during labor may cause a decrease in the oxygen flow to the neonate through the umbilical cord. Anoxia can occur before birth if, for example, the mother is anemic. Because of an iron deficiency in the blood, the blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the fetus. The amount of oxygen in the blood of the fetus therefore is quite low and has an adverse effect on the child's development. Anoxia is responsible for brain cell damage. It has been cited to be the cause of some learning and behavioral difficulties. Cerebal palsy, in which there is arm and leg paralysis, finger and facial tremors, or an inability to use vocal muscles, has been traced to anoxia as its cause. Anoxia may result in the irritability of the neonate during the first week of life. It can cause tension in muscles and a decreased sensitivity to pain and visual stimulation. Studies concerned with the long-term effects of anoxia have found that children who suffered from the disease scored slightly lower on IQ tests than other children during mid-childhood. These children however, may compensate for this difference in later years.",

            "text": "Question:\nDefine emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.\n\nOptions:\nA. Emotion is a state of happiness.\nB. Emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal level, defined in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.\nC.             Emotion is a state of sadness.\nD. Emotion is a state of anger.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nEmotion can be broadly defined as a complex state of the organism, generally characterized by a heightened arousal level. The term emotion can be defined in three basic ways: in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Davitz(1969) found that for most people, the term emotion applies to a particular set of feelings. A person feels anger if someone is offensive to him, pleasure if he receives a gift, or fear if a fierce animal is about to attack him.Behavioristicpsychologists dislike defining emotion as feelings, since a feeling is a highly subjective state and cannot be measured objectively. As such, they are not likely to yield consistent data; and, in addition, they are difficult to organize. However, much recent work in organizing emotional feeling states has proved encouraging. Emotion may also be thought of as a response. \"Response\" in this case refers not only to an overt behavior, but also to an internal process that occurs as a result of a particular stimulus, either external or internal, which is significant to the individual. Emotion as a response has been viewed in two ways. First, some consider it a response to one's perception and judgment of a particular stimulus situation. For example, if a person perceives and judges a particular situation to be threatening, fear will be the emotional response. Other investigators supporting the (very early) position of William James see emotion as a response to physiological events that occur during a state of arousal.

The anxiety that motivated them to learn the avoidance response was viewed by Miller both as an emotion and a motive.

                "solution": "Emotion can be broadly defined as a complex state of the organism, generally characterized by a heightened arousal level. The term emotion can be defined in three basic ways: in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Davitz(1969) found that for most people, the term emotion applies to a particular set of feelings. A person feels anger if someone is offensive to him, pleasure if he receives a gift, or fear if a fierce animal is about to attack him.Behavioristicpsychologists dislike defining emotion as feelings, since a feeling is a highly subjective state and cannot be measured objectively. As such, they are not likely to yield consistent data; and, in addition, they are difficult to organize. However, much recent work in organizing emotional feeling states has proved encouraging. Emotion may also be thought of as a response. \"Response\" in this case refers not only to an overt behavior, but also to an internal process that occurs as a result of a particular stimulus, either external or internal, which is significant to the individual. Emotion as a response has been viewed in two ways. First, some consider it a response to one's perception and judgment of a particular stimulus situation. For example, if a person perceives and judges a particular situation to be threatening, fear will be the emotional response. Other investigators supporting the (very early) position of William James see emotion as a response to physiological events that occur during a state of arousal. James suggested that emotions are responses to such bodily changes as increased heart rate and respiration. Emotion can also be viewed in terms of motivation. To some investigators, emotion is identical to motivation. There are two ways to look at emotion in this light.

Fight or flight response, psychoanalytic theory, and control theory\nC.             Psychoanalytic theory, stimulus-response theory, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs\nD. Psychoanalytic theory of neurotic anxiety, stimulus-response explanation, and concepts of control and helplessness.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAnxiety is construed in different ways by different theorists. The psychoanalytictheory of neurotic anxiety is concerned with overstimulation(overstimulation refers to the existence of many impulses, wishes, and needs that cannot be gratified)r learning theorists use a stimulus-response explanation, and other theorists utilize the concepts of controland helplessness. Freud (psychoanalytic theory) based his final theory of anxiety on theidea that anxiety becomes a signal of future overstimulation. If overstimulation(by id impulses, for example) is allowed to occur the personmay be reduced to a state of extreme helplessness as at birth (whichis the prototypical anxiety situation). Anxiety thus signals the ego to actprior to overstimulation. Neurotic anxiety is the fear of the consequences of allowing a previouslypunished impulse to be expressed. As an example, a child developsneurotic anxiety when he or she has begun to associate punishmentwith the satisfaction of a particular wishful impulse. Neurotic anxietyaccompanies the continued desire for gratification of this impulse. This kind of anxiety is related to a fear of the loss of love; the child imaginesthat gratification of a particular impulse will not only yield punishmentbut loss of love as well. Neurotic anxiety differs somewhat fromthe kind of anxiety that signals overstimulation. Behaviorists consider anxiety to be an internal response that may belearned through classical conditioning. A tone, followed by a shock, can beshown to produce fear in rats even when the shock is subsequently takenaway. Fear (or anxiety) in this stimulus-response analysis is both an internalresponse and a drive (which is related to avoidance behavior). However, this type of analysis has not been shown to be useful in dealing withanxious people. Since anxiety is a psychological construct and is not clearlyidentifiable with any set of behaviors, Behaviorists are at a loss to explainit adequately. Many behaviorists reject the concept of anxiety altogetherand prefer instead to discuss behavioral manifestations of \"internalresponses.\" In fact, B. F. Skinner denies that consideration of \"internalresponses\" has any use and suggests that we should only considerovert behaviors when analyzing \"behavioral problems.\" One common thread in the psychoanalytic and learning theories of anxietyis the issue of control. The ego cannot control the threat of overstimulation, and the rat cannot control the painful stimulus. Experimental evidence with both humans and animals has demonstrated theimportance of feelings of control or helplessness in the development of anxiety. A lack ofcontrol,or a perceived lack of control of a particular situationmay lead to anxiety.",

                "solution": "Anxiety is construed in different ways by different theorists. The psychoanalytictheory of neurotic anxiety is concerned with overstimulation(overstimulation refers to the existence of many impulses, wishes, and needs that cannot be gratified)r learning theorists use a stimulus-response explanation, and other theorists utilize the concepts of controland helplessness. Freud (psychoanalytic theory) based his final theory of anxiety on theidea that anxiety becomes a signal of future overstimulation. If overstimulation(by id impulses, for example) is allowed to occur the personmay be reduced to a state of extreme helplessness as at birth (whichis the prototypical anxiety situation). Anxiety thus signals the ego to actprior to overstimulation. Neurotic anxiety is the fear of the consequences of allowing a previouslypunished impulse to be expressed. As an example, a child developsneurotic anxiety when he or she has begun to associate punishmentwith the satisfaction of a particular wishful impulse. Neurotic anxietyaccompanies the continued desire for gratification of this impulse. This kind of anxiety is related to a fear of the loss of love; the child imaginesthat gratification of a particular impulse will not only yield punishmentbut loss of love as well. Neurotic anxiety differs somewhat fromthe kind of anxiety that signals overstimulation. Behaviorists consider anxiety to be an internal response that may belearned through classical conditioning. A tone, followed by a shock, can beshown to produce fear in rats even when the shock is subsequently takenaway. Fear (or anxiety) in this stimulus-response analysis is both an internalresponse and a drive (which is related to avoidance behavior). However, this type of analysis has not been shown to be useful in dealing withanxious people. Since anxiety is a psychological construct and is not clearlyidentifiable with any set of behaviors, Behaviorists are at a loss to explainit adequately. Many behaviorists reject the concept of anxiety altogetherand prefer instead to discuss behavioral manifestations of \"internalresponses.\" In fact, B. F. Skinner denies that consideration of \"internalresponses\" has any use and suggests that we should only considerovert behaviors when analyzing \"behavioral problems.\" One common thread in the psychoanalytic and learning theories of anxietyis the issue of control. The ego cannot control the threat of overstimulation, and the rat cannot control the painful stimulus. Experimental evidence with both humans and animals has demonstrated theimportance of feelings of control or helplessness in the development of anxiety. A lack ofcontrol,or a perceived lack of control of a particular situationmay lead to anxiety."

While most of us would like to have our own way as often as possible, we do not want to be manipulated by someone else if we can help it. In the early 1950's Richard Christie became interested in how and in what ways people differed in manipulative tendencies. The principles of Machiavelli, which are described inThe Prince, give advice on manipulating other people, and the term \"Machiavellian\" has come to be associated with the belief that the ends justify the means and that in order to maintain power one must manipulate people. It was these two tactics that interested Christie, and he sought to discover to what degree they were used by individuals in everyday life. With his associates, he developed a scale based on items drawn fromThe Prince, such as, \"It is wise to flatter important people,\" \"Most people don't know what is best for them,\" \"It is safer to be feared than to be loved.\" There has been much research using the scale and its subsequent refinements which points to a number of stable findings. Interestingly, scores on the \"Mach\" scales do not correlate with those on the F (Fascist) Scale which measures degree of authoritarianism, and therefore the two tests measure different tendencies. Christie proposed (and these positions have been mainly supported by the research)the following four characteristics of an effective manipulator: 1. The relative lack of emotion when dealing with people: Emotional attachments would interfere with manipulation attempts. 2. Lack of conventional morality: In situations in which attainment of power was most important, standard moral practices would need to be seen as an obstacle to the goal. Remember the manipulator holds to the philosophy that \"the ends justify the means.\" 3. No strong ideological commitments: For the same reasons as those stated above, any strong, emotional commitment would tend to reduce the effectiveness of the manipulative type in certain situations that might involve personally important issues. High Mach individuals do very well when asked to speak persuasively on an emotional issue they do not favor. 4. Relative psychological balance: Any gross psychopathology would impede the Machiavellian type from making rational judgments about others with whom he had to deal. That is, his own psychological needs might color his perceptions about those with whom he was interacting. There is some evidence supporting the idea that people who are involved in roles demanding a good deal of interpersonal contact tend toward higher scores than those who are in impersonal, more distant situations. For instance, in research on intended specialties among medical students, those naming psychiatry and pediatrics scored the highest on the Mach scale and those selecting surgery scored lowest. Of course, this tendency, like most personality variables, does not exist impure form in anyone. A person may display these tendencies in one situation and be quite different in another.",

An experimental control is a statistical analysis technique\nC.             An experimental control is a data collection method\nD. An experimental control is a way of taking into account the possible effect of an extraneous independent variable that is not considered in the hypothesis being tested.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAn experimental control is a way of taking into account the possible effectof an extraneous independent variable that is not considered in the hypothesisbeing tested. Since there may be many independent variables presentin an experimental situation it is essential to know which of the variablesare actually affecting the dependent variables. There may be many\"invisible\" but highly relevant variables. The experimenter should alwaysattempt to discover and \"control for\" the possible effects of variablesnot of interest. If an experimenter wanted to test the effect of a new drug on a laboratoryrat's pain threshold he might give one group of rats injections of thedrug and leave an identical group of rats untreated. He would then test themean pain thresholds of the two groups to determine if there is a significantdifference between the experimental (drug) and control groups. However, even though the experimenter may find a significant difference hecannot be sure that the difference is attributable to the effect of the new drug. He must have a third group of rats that is given injections of some innocuoussubstance, for example, water. Otherwise, he cannot be certain thatthe difference in pain thresholds is attributable to the drug or to the experienceof the injection. There should not be a significant difference betweenthe mean pain threshold of the untreated group and the group thatreceived the innocuous injections if the experimenter is to conclude thatthe significant difference between the untreated group and the group injectedwith the drug is attributable only to the drug. An experiment should usually have at least two groups. One group shouldbe experimentally manipulated and the other group should be a controlgroup. This is essential in order to be certain that any changes whichtake place in the experimentally manipulated group would not have occurrednaturally. For example, if an educator wanted to test the effect of anew remedial reading program on 5th graders, it is not sufficient to know thatbefore the program the mean reading level of the subjects was 3.1 andafter a year program it was 4.8. It is possible that those 5th graders' readinglevels would have risen even in the absence of the experimental program. The educator must use two groups; both groups should have the sameinitial mean reading level and the same reading problems. One group, however, should not be included in the program. In this way it is possibleto assess the effect of the program. If after a year, the group whichwas included in the program has a mean reading level of 4.8 and thegroup not included has a level of 3.9, and if this difference was statisticallyand reliably significant, then it could be concluded that the remedialreading program was effective. The conclusions based on many (especially early) psychological experimentsmay be invalid because of the absence of control groups and otherexperimental controls. Without controls many studies are essentially uselessbecause it is not possible to be certain about the real cause of the change, if there is one, in the experimental group.",

                "answer": "D",
                "solution": "An experimental control is a way of taking into account the possible effectof an extraneous independent variable that is not considered in the hypothesisbeing tested. Since there may be many independent variables presentin an experimental situation it is essential to know which of the variablesare actually affecting the dependent variables. There may be many\"invisible\" but highly relevant variables. The experimenter should alwaysattempt to discover and \"control for\" the possible effects of variablesnot of interest. If an experimenter wanted to test the effect of a new drug on a laboratoryrat's pain threshold he might give one group of rats injections of thedrug and leave an identical group of rats untreated. He would then test themean pain thresholds of the two groups to determine if there is a significantdifference between the experimental (drug) and control groups. However, even though the experimenter may find a significant difference hecannot be sure that the difference is attributable to the effect of the new drug. He must have a third group of rats that is given injections of some innocuoussubstance, for example, water. Otherwise, he cannot be certain thatthe difference in pain thresholds is attributable to the drug or to the experienceof the injection. There should not be a significant difference betweenthe mean pain threshold of the untreated group and the group thatreceived the innocuous injections if the experimenter is to conclude thatthe significant difference between the untreated group and the group injectedwith the drug is attributable only to the drug. An experiment should usually have at least two groups. One group shouldbe experimentally manipulated and the other group should be a controlgroup. This is essential in order to be certain that any changes whichtake place in the experimentally manipulated group would not have occurrednaturally. For example, if an educator wanted to test the effect of anew remedial reading program on 5th graders, it is not sufficient to know thatbefore the program the mean reading level of the subjects was 3.1 andafter a year program it was 4.8. It is possible that those 5th graders' readinglevels would have risen even in the absence of the experimental program. The educator must use two groups; both groups should have the sameinitial mean reading level and the same reading problems. One group, however, should not be included in the program. In this way it is possibleto assess the effect of the program. If after a year, the group whichwas included in the program has a mean reading level of 4.8 and thegroup not included has a level of 3.9, and if this difference was statisticallyand reliably significant, then it could be concluded that the remedialreading program was effective. The conclusions based on many (especially early) psychological experimentsmay be invalid because of the absence of control groups and otherexperimental controls. Without controls many studies are essentially uselessbecause it is not possible to be certain about the real cause of the change, if there is one, in the experimental group."

Criterion-related validity refers to the bias in a test's results\nC.             Criterion-related validity measures the test's consistency\nD. Criterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predicting an individual's behavior in specified situations.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nCriterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predictingan individual's behavior in specified situations. This is done by comparingperformance on the test with an independent measure of validity, i.e., a criterion. If the test in question is, for example, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, then a suitable criterion would be future college grades. There are two types of criterion-related validity, concurrent and predictive. Predictive validity is related to tests employed for the prediction of futureoutcomes, e.g., \"Is Mrs. Brown likely to become neurotic?\" Predictive validity is most useful when applied to tests designed to select andclassify personnel: hiring job applicants, selecting students for admissionto college or professional school, or assigning military personnelto training programs. The concept of concurrent validity is concerned with tests employed fordiagnosis of an existing status, e.g., \"Is Mrs. Brown neurotic?\" Sometimes concurrent validity is used as a poor substitute for predictive validityin instances where there is no time to evaluate a future criterion. The usual purpose of a test with only concurrent validity is to provide a simplerand quicker substitute for the criterion data. It is important to rememberthat when a test has concurrent validity, the criterion, by definition, is available for use by the examiner. The examiner uses the test onlyif it is more efficient in decision-making than the criterion. The criteria themselves should have four qualities. These are: relevance, reliability, availability, and freedom from bias. A criterion is consideredto be relevant if the same factors determine success on it as determinesuccess on the test. School grades in mathematics are relevant criteriafor a mathematics aptitude test because success in a school subjectis determined by basically the same factors as success on an aptitudetest for that subject. The reliability of the criterion refers to its stabilityas a measure. A criterion would have no value if it was inconsistentin its ratings of one individual over a short period of time. The availability of the criterion is a practical but important consideration. It is most desirable if a criterion score can be derived with aminimum of difficulty, expense, and time. Freedom of bias means that thereshould be no \"criterion contamination.\" One of the serious problems encountered in assessing validity is criterioncontamination. Criterion contamination results when the criterion isno longer independent from the test results. This most often occurs whena supposedly objective rater is biased by test scores. (In this case the\"objective rating\" is considered the actual criterion measurement). For example, if an individual performs very poorly on a mathematics aptitude testand a teacher is aware of these results then the teacher's future rating ofthe individual's mathematical aptitude (the criterion) may be negatively affected. Under these or similar circumstances the teacher's rating, i.e., thecriterion with which the aptitude test is supposed to be validated, is contaminated. It is essential that the rater be absolutely ignorant of the originaltest scores when the purpose of the rating is to validate the test scores. The type of criterion an examiner selects usually depends on the natureof the test he is trying to validate. Basically, there are six types of criteriain common use. Intelligence tests are usually validated against someindex of academic achievement (school grades, achievement tests andteachers' ratings). One of the criticisms of intelligence tests is that sincethey are validated according to an index of academic achievement it cannotbe said with certainty that the test measures intelligence per se; thereis no obvious criterion that can be used to measure innate intelligence. Special aptitude tests are usually validated against one of two criteria. For example, in an Air Force pilot- selection test the criterion is performancein basic Flight training. Another criterion often used is the job performancerecord of the individual. However, this criterion would probablynot be used for an Air Force pilot- selection test because it is too dangerousto wait and see if an individual will be successful in combat (luckilythis can usually be determined in specialized training). Performance in specialized training is often preferred as a criterion to job performancebecause there is a greater uniformity of conditions possible duringtraining. An individual's job performance record may also be used asa criterion to validate intelligence and personality tests. Validation by the method of contrasted groups involves a criterion whichis based on the expected difference in performance of two groups. For an intelligence test it is expected that a group of institutionalized mentallyretarded children will have significantly lower scores than normal schoolchildren. An intelligence test that could not produce this pattern of resultswould be invalid. On a personality test designed to assess social skillsor traits the test performance of salesmen may be compared to the testperformance of engineers. It might be expected that salesmen would beparticularly socially adept because their job entails a great deal of socialinteraction. A personality test claiming to measure social adeptness mightbe considered invalid if it did not produce higher scores for salesmenthan engineers. The fifth criterion commonly used for validation (also for item selection) is psychiatric diagnosis. We might reasonably hope that a psychiatricdiagnosis based on prolonged observation and a detailed case historywould support the findings of a personality test. Unfortunately, oftenthis is not the case. It has been found that \"projective tests\" like the Rorschach Inkblot, the Thematic Apperception Test, and even \"empirical tests\" like the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI) which aredesigned to make diagnoses of individuals are often poor substitutes forprofessional psychiatric diagnoses. The sixth and last kind of criterion measure commonly used is a previouslyavailable test. This type of validation is usually used to validate ashorter, more easily administered test against a longer version. For example, a group administered multiple choice answer intelligence test maybe validated against the older and longer, individually administered Stanford-Binettest.If its results correlate highly with the Stanford-Binet thenit might be useful to use the new test in many situations. Criterion-related validity is often referred to as empirical validation becausea test's results are being compared with something empirical or objective. One of the major criticisms of projective tests, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, is that they are not empirically validated and thereforecannot be said to be assessing anything with certainty. It is essentialin all tests that claim to have predictive value to compare results withan empirical criterion; it is important to establish criterion-related validity.",

It is the process of making assumptions about a population\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nA statistical hypothesis is some assertion about a population. This hypothesisis tested by selecting a sample from the population and calculatingthe validity of the assertion for the sample. The results are then generalizedto the population as a whole, this generalization being expressedas a probability that the generalization is true. In statistics, all phenomena are described by some numerical characteristic. Thus, the distribution of males in the U.S. can be described interms of average height, weight, income, number of children, years of college, etc. Notice, however, that it would be difficult to describe them as clever, useful, etc. without a prior definition of terms. Thus, when conducting a test of a hypothesis it is necessary to (i)knowexactly which population is being sampled and (ii) describe the populationcharacteristics numerically. Suppose an investigator concludes onthe basis of testing 100 dogs that they can be trained to kill rabbits; this doesnot mean that it is necessarily true for all dogs. The composition of thesample must be checked to ensure that it is representative of the total populationof interest (all dogs). If the sample contained a large percentageof Doberman Pinschers and only a few cocker spaniels, then thevalidity of the test and, therefore, the hypothesis is questionable. The two hypotheses tested in statistics are called the null (H_o) and alternative(sometimes called the Affirmative) hypotheses (H_A). An investigatorusually conducts an experiment in order to show that an existingtheory should be modified in some way. The null hypothesis assertsthat no modification is required, i.e., that the population characteristics(parameters) have not changed or that the parameters of 2 samplesare the same and thus both samples can be said to come from thesame population. The alternative hypothesis states that the change hasoccurred and, (hopefully), specifies the new population parameters. For example, it is now believed that the males born after the Second World Wararetaller than their pre-1945 counterparts. This conclusion wasreached after several Census surveys. The null and alternative hypothesesin this case would be H_o :The average height has not changed(1) H_A :The average height has changed and is greater than before.(2) Note that no numerical values have been specified and so we do not yet havea statistical test. Assuming that the average height before 1945 was 5'8\" (1) and (2) become H_o :The average height (\\mu) = 5'8\"(3) H_A :The average height is greater than 5'8\"(4) Note that the null hypothesis (3) specifies a unique value to the population. It is called a simple hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis (4) isactually composed of several hypotheses (the average height is 5'9\", 5'10\", 6', 112'4\", etc.)It is therefore called a composite hypothesis. Ideally, for statistical analysis, both the null and alternative hypotheses shouldbe simple, i.e., assign a value to the population parameter. For example: H_o = \\mu = 5'8\"(5) H_A = \\mu = 5'10\"(6) In the social sciences most statistical hypotheses of the form (3), (4).

            "text": "Question:\nWhat is cross-validation and why is it important?\n\nOptions:\nA. Cross-validation is a method to determine the validity of a test on the same sample\nB. Cross-validation is not important in small samples\nC.             Cross-validation is a method to validate a test without additional samples\nD. Cross-validation is a method to independently determine the validity of a test on additional samples, it is necessary especially when the initial validation sample is small, to avoid errors and chance factors.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nWhen the original sample of individuals upon whom a set of test itemsis validated is small and when the test items have been selected froma large number of possible alternatives, it is necessary to cross-validate; i.e., it is necessary to independently determine the validityof the entire test on additional samples of subjects. Often, a test is hypothesizedto have a particular predictive value and in a preliminary validationstudy, it may be found that the test is in fact highly predictive. However, since the initial validation sample is usually fairly small, the chanceof there being an error in the validation study is large. Statistical analysesbecome increasingly more accurate as the number of people in thesample increases. If a sample in a study is too small, then often statisticsare of no use in analyzing the data and the conclusions that are arrivedat may be attributable to chance factors. A good example of the needand importance of cross-validation is found in an investigation of the possibleuses of the Rorschach inkblot test (Kurtz, 1948) . The investigatorswere attempting to determine whether the Rorschach test responsescould be used to select sales managers for life insurance companies. Eighty managers were chosen from several hundred employedin various life insurance companies. Forty-two had been previouslyrated as being satisfactory and thirty-eight as unsatisfactory. All eightymanagers were given the Rorschach test and their test records werescrutinized. A scoring key was developed based on whether certain patternswere reported more often by the very satisfactory group as comparedto the unsatisfactory group. The scoring key was reapplied to theoriginal group of eighty and seventy-nine of the eighty were correctly classifiedas be-longing to either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory group. Thus, the correlation between test score and the criterion was close to + 1.0. However, when the test was cross-validated on a new sample of 41 managersthe scoring key was practically useless in classification. The correlationbetween criterion and test score was a negligible 0.02. These resultsindicate that the original finding, that seventy-nine out of eighty managerscould be correctly classified, could probably be attributed to chancefactors. It is likely that whatever it was in the Rorschach responses that discriminatedbetween the satisfactory and unsatisfactory managers was uniqueto those eighty managers. These responses were not traits which couldbe generalized to all insurance managers. The basic flaw in the studywas that the experimenter selected those responses which discriminatedbetween the two groups as his \"target responses\" and then usedthe very same responses to see whether the test discriminated betweenthe two groups. It is obvious that the responses would discriminatebetween the groups because they were chosen because they discriminatedin the first place! What the experimenter should have done wasto ascertain whether those Rorschach responses discriminated solely onthe basis of whether the manager was satisfactory or unsatisfactory.

                "solution": "When the original sample of individuals upon whom a set of test itemsis validated is small and when the test items have been selected froma large number of possible alternatives, it is necessary to cross-validate; i.e., it is necessary to independently determine the validityof the entire test on additional samples of subjects. Often, a test is hypothesizedto have a particular predictive value and in a preliminary validationstudy, it may be found that the test is in fact highly predictive. However, since the initial validation sample is usually fairly small, the chanceof there being an error in the validation study is large. Statistical analysesbecome increasingly more accurate as the number of people in thesample increases. If a sample in a study is too small, then often statisticsare of no use in analyzing the data and the conclusions that are arrivedat may be attributable to chance factors. A good example of the needand importance of cross-validation is found in an investigation of the possibleuses of the Rorschach inkblot test (Kurtz, 1948) . The investigatorswere attempting to determine whether the Rorschach test responsescould be used to select sales managers for life insurance companies. Eighty managers were chosen from several hundred employedin various life insurance companies. Forty-two had been previouslyrated as being satisfactory and thirty-eight as unsatisfactory. All eightymanagers were given the Rorschach test and their test records werescrutinized. A scoring key was developed based on whether certain patternswere reported more often by the very satisfactory group as comparedto the unsatisfactory group. The scoring key was reapplied to theoriginal group of eighty and seventy-nine of the eighty were correctly classifiedas be-longing to either the satisfactory or unsatisfactory group. Thus, the correlation between test score and the criterion was close to + 1.0. However, when the test was cross-validated on a new sample of 41 managersthe scoring key was practically useless in classification. The correlationbetween criterion and test score was a negligible 0.02. These resultsindicate that the original finding, that seventy-nine out of eighty managerscould be correctly classified, could probably be attributed to chancefactors. It is likely that whatever it was in the Rorschach responses that discriminatedbetween the satisfactory and unsatisfactory managers was uniqueto those eighty managers. These responses were not traits which couldbe generalized to all insurance managers. The basic flaw in the studywas that the experimenter selected those responses which discriminatedbetween the two groups as his \"target responses\" and then usedthe very same responses to see whether the test discriminated betweenthe two groups. It is obvious that the responses would discriminatebetween the groups because they were chosen because they discriminatedin the first place! What the experimenter should have done wasto ascertain whether those Rorschach responses discriminated solely onthe basis of whether the manager was satisfactory or unsatisfactory. The basis for the discriminatory power of those Rorschach responses was probablynot any trait associated with being a good manager or a bad manager. Thus, before a psychologist draws conclusions and publishes findingshe should be certain that his test or experimental procedure can becross-validated. Too often psychologists (and other scientists) are contentwith superficially validated data and do not submit these data to a morerigorous analysis of validity."

In the presence of blue , the blue receptors would fire more strongly, and in the presence of yellow light, the yellow would be triggered with more intensity. If, however, the eye focuses on blue for a prolonged period of time, the blue receptors through fatigue would be unable to respond adequately. If, then the eye looks at white, the yellow receptor would respond normally, but the blue would be inhibited. Since the yellow response outweighs the blue, the white light would be seen as yellow. At the present time this opponent process model is the most common explanation of the mechanisms underlying the aftereffect phenomenon.",

It is estimated that over 75 percent of the dramatic shows seen on television contain violence. What is the effect of all of this violence on the children who watch it? There are essentially three viewpoints concerning the effects of violent television programming. The social learning theorists claim that television provides models for aggressive behavior and thereby reinforces already acquired aggressive acts and helps to instill new ones in the viewers. Because these models are on television they demonstrate that aggressive behavior is rewarded. Also viewing such activity tends to increase the arousal level of the viewers and thus the likelihood of being provoked into aggressive behavior. Another group of theorists believe that the watching of violence on television has a cathartic effect--through watching violent individuals on television, the aggressive energy that builds up in every human is released vicariously. It reduces the aggressive energy level and thus reduces the possibility that aggressive action will occur. Finally, some believe that that the effects of television on aggression are unknown, that it has not been proven that television either reduces or increases the possibility of aggressive behavior in its viewers. In fact, the studies that support the cathartic hypothesis are in serious question due to several problems in the experimental design. The majority of experiments conducted in this area have shown an increase in aggression as the result of watching television. It seems particularly true that violent television increases aggression in children that already have aggressive tendencies. However, it is not correct to blame television entirely for a person's aggressive behavior. There are too many other variables. The environment in which a child lives each day, the models of his parents or friends, the rewards and punishments he receives for aggressive behavior all affect the level of aggression.

To research the role of genetic factors in schizophrenia, twinstudies were designed to find out whether the concordance rate for schizophreniais greater for identical (monozygotic) twins, than it is for fraternal(dizygotic) twins. In a major study in Norway,Kringlen(1967) found a 38 percent concordancefor identical twins as contrasted with 10 percent in fraternal twins. There were 55 pairs of identical twins and 172 pairs of fraternal twins.Gottesmanand Shields (1972) found a concordance rate of 42 percent for identical (MZ) and 9 percent for fraternal twins (DZ) who werehospitalized and diagnosed as schizophrenic. They also found that theconcordance was much higher for twins with severe schizophrenic disordersthan for those with mild symptoms. Although the concordance rate for schizophrenia in identical twins ishigh, the discordance rate is higher. If schizophrenia were solely the resultof genetic factors, the concordance rate for identical twins would be onehundred. One must also take into account that since the twins have beenreared together, a common environment rather than common geneticfactors may account for concordance rates. In a study by Rosenthal (1970) 16 pairs of monozygotic twins were rearedapart from very early childhood. Of the 16 pairs, 10 were concordantand 6 were discordant. The concordance rate of this limited samplewas 62.5 percent, a finding that supports the view that a predispositionfor schizophrenia is genetically transmitted. Because of the smallsample size, however, the data cannot be regarded as conclusive. Although studies have not proven that schizophrenia is solely transmittedthrough genetic factors, the findings support the view that a predispositionfor schizophrenia may exist. Here it is presumed that certainindividuals are more prone to develop schizophrenia if placed undersevere stress. However, given a more favorable life situation, the individualsinherent vulnerability may never exhibit itself in the form of schizophrenicbehavior.",

Rogers came to understand that an individual's personality was conditionedby his interactions with significant others. The evaluations of hisbehavior by the adults in his world are assimilated by the child's self-structure. Many behaviors consistent with his parents' conception of whathe should be will be praised; while behaviors that are inconsistent withwhat his parents perceive him to be will be punished or responded to withemotional rejection. Through this process the child learns to experiencereality second-hand, as he begins to be guided by the safe feelingshe receives when he is engaged in behavior that is acceptable to hisparents. Experience is thus distorted in the service of maintaining positiveregard from his parents. This positive feedback eventually contributesto a \"self\" image that comes to dictate what types of events an individualwill permit to enter awareness and what types will be excluded.

Mother's exercise habits, father's income, baby's gender\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe interuterine environment of the fetus is relatively stable. However, there are factors that can affect the mother, and in turn, affect the fetus. While there is no direct connection between the nervous system of the mother and that of the child, their physical connection is very close. Hence, factors that affect the physical wellbeing of the mother will affect the child. The mother's diet is of utmost importance during prenatal development. Studies have shown that nutritional deficiency can result in mental retardation, rickets, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy. Women on proper diets reduce the chances of premature birth, stillbirth, and miscarriage. This is understandable since the fetus derives its nourishment from the mother. Studies have also indicated that intelligence is dependent on the diet of the mother during pregnancy. Children born to mothers who had enriched diets during pregnancy scored higher on intelligence tests than the children of mothers who didn't. The mother's age also influences prenatal development. The optimal age for the mother is between twenty-three and twenty-nine years. Studies have shown a higher mortality rate and a greater incidence of mongolism when women give birth while they are above or below this interval. The probability of mental deficiency in the child increases as the woman enters menopause. Emotional stress in the mother also affects the fetus. Prolonged emotional stress increases hyperactivity in the fetus and increases the likelihood of a difficult labor and delivery. The attitude of the mother is also important to fetal development. Women who possess poor attitudes concerning motherhood, and women who don't really want their child, will experience a more stressful labor and delivery than those women who are happy and satisfied about their impending role. Often, the mother's attitude toward her unborn child will be the same after the child is born and this will affect the child's development.

Thorndike's Law of Effect, whichstates that responses may be altered depending on the effects they producein the environment. At about the same time Thorndike was conductinghis experiments at Columbia University, Small introduced the mazeas a learning instrument for animals. The maze soon became standardequipment for operant conditioning experiments and has probablybeen used more than any other type of learning problem. The first systematic study of operant conditioning was made by B. F. Skinner in 1938.He developed an apparatus (now known as the \"Skinner box\" second only to the maze as standard equipment in learning experiments) which consisted of a small enclosure with a lever device and afood receptacle. A hungry rat was placed in thebox,and in time usually pressedthe lever by chance, and automatically received food (a reward). After some time, most of the rats learned to make this response (lever-pressing) as soon as they entered the box. This learning was termedoperant conditioning because the animal had to perform an operationto get a reward. Skinner later applied the techniques of OC to the development of teachingmachines. In recent years,Skinner' sattention has extended to philosophicalissues based on his operant conditioning theory, the result beingthe bookBeyond Freedom and Dignityin which he subscribes to the doctrineof determinism. From his laboratory experiments with rats he has cometo the belief that societies as well as individuals can be controlled. In the past two decades the number of operant conditioning psychologistshas increased more than in any other area of psychology.

At about the same time Thorndike was conductinghis experiments at Columbia University, Small introduced the mazeas a learning instrument for animals. The maze soon became standardequipment for operant conditioning experiments and has probablybeen used more than any other type of learning problem. The first systematic study of operant conditioning was made by B. F. Skinner in 1938.He developed an apparatus (now known as the \"Skinner box\" second only to the maze as standard equipment in learning experiments) which consisted of a small enclosure with a lever device and afood receptacle. A hungry rat was placed in thebox,and in time usually pressedthe lever by chance, and automatically received food (a reward). After some time, most of the rats learned to make this response (lever-pressing) as soon as they entered the box. This learning was termedoperant conditioning because the animal had to perform an operationto get a reward. Skinner later applied the techniques of OC to the development of teachingmachines. In recent years,Skinner' sattention has extended to philosophicalissues based on his operant conditioning theory, the result beingthe bookBeyond Freedom and Dignityin which he subscribes to the doctrineof determinism. From his laboratory experiments with rats he has cometo the belief that societies as well as individuals can be controlled. In the past two decades the number of operant conditioning psychologistshas increased more than in any other area of psychology. As the operant movement grows, the field for research is constantly expanding."

Labor occurs when the fetus, placenta, and other membranes, are separated from and expelled from the mother's body\nB. Labor is the process of fetal development\nC.             Labor is the act of conceiving a child\nD. Labor is the period of gestation\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nLabor occurs when the fetus, placenta, and other membranes, are separated from and expelled from the mother's body. Labor usually occurs approximately 280 days after the start of the woman's last menstrual period. In the first stage of labor, the cervix (opening to the uterus) enlarges to facilitate passage of the fetus down the birth canal. Contractions occur which exert a downward pressure on the fetus and cause the cervix to widen further. At first the contractions are low in intensity and are spaced far apart, but gradually they increase in intensity and occur closer together. The actual process of birth is possible once the cervix is sufficiently dilated. In a normal delivery, the baby's head will appear at the opening of the cervix and continue to pass through it until the entire body has been expelled. This stage of labor usually takes about one hour. The third stage of labor is called the afterbirth. During this time the placenta and other membranes are expelled.",
