By Newton's Second Law, F = ma, and the acceleration of m is then a = - [(Gm_e) / r^2] But, being that the trajectory is radial, a = (dv/dr) (dr/dt) = v (dv/dr) = - [(Gm_e) / r^2] where v is the object's velocity. vdv= - G m_e (dr/r^2)(1) Now, we want a projectile to leave the earth (r = R_e) with a velocityv_eand to reach a destination at which it no longer feels the effect of the earth's gravitation-al force. If it reaches this point , the body can have no velocity and yet still not be accelerated towards the earth. Since the gravitational force is zero at \\infty, we require that v = 0 at r = \\infty.

In order to do this, we must find r as a function of t. Going back to (1) vdv= -Gm_e(dr/r^2) But, now, v = v at r = r, and v =v_eat r = R_e and ^v\\int_(v)e vdv= - G m_e ^r\\int_(R)e (dr/r^2) [(v^2 - v^2_e) / 2] =Gm_e[(1/r) - (1/R_e)] v^2 = v^2_e + (2Gm_e / r) - (2Gm_e / R_e)(3) However, from (2) v^2_e = (2Gm_e / R_e) Therefore, from (3) v^2 = (2Gm_e / r) v = [\\surd(2Gm_e) / (r^1/2)] To find v as a function of t, note that v = (dr/dt) Therefore,[\\surd(2Gm_e) / (r^1/2)] = (dr/dt) r^1/2dr= \\surd(2Gm_e)dt Since r = R_e when t = 0, and r = 2R_e when t = t, ^(2R)_e\\int_(R)e r^1/2dr= \\surd(2Gm_e) ^t\\int_0dt (2/3) r^3/2\\vert^(2R)e (R)e= \\surd(2Gm_e) t (2R_e)^3/2 - (R_e)^3/2 = (3/2) \\surd(2Gm_e) t ort = [{2[(2R_e)^3/2 - (R_e)^3/2]} / {3\\surd(2Gm_e)}] = [{2R_e ^3/2[(2)^3/2 - 1]} / {3\\surd(2Gm_e)}] t = [{2(6.38 \u00d7 10^6 m)^3/2 [(2)^3/2 - 1]} / {3\\surd[(2)(6.67 \u00d7 10^-11 N \\bullet m^2/kg^2)(5.98 \u00d7 10^24 kg)]}] t = [{2(1.61 \u00d7 10^10 m^3/2) (1.83)} / {3(2.82 \u00d7 10^7 N^1/2 \\textbullet m/kg^1/2)}] t = 696.53 s = 11.61 minutes This is the time required for the object to reach t = 2R_e ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nThe eccentricity of the orbit of a, particle of mass m moving around a fixed mass M is given by e = [1 + {(2l^2E) / (G^2M^2m^3)}]^1/2 where l is the angular momentum, E is the total energy of the system.

(a) 170 ft/sec, (b) -170 ft/sec, (c) 450 ft\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nNear the surface of the earth, all objects fall towards its center with a constant acceleration g = 32 ft/sec^2. Therefore, when the ball is thrown, its speed must decrease by 32 ft/sec each second until it reaches 'its maximum height. Then it starts to fall, gaining speed at the rate of 32 ft/sec^2, and retraces its path, hitting the ground with the same speed at which it started the trip upward. This is so because the acceleration is constant and the distance traveled is the same during the rising and falling portions of the motion of the ball. Thus, the average velocity must have the same magnitude in each case and the time required to reach the maximum height must equal the time required to fall back to the ground. (a) Let the upward direction be positive. Then v_0 is positive and the acceleration a is negative. After 10 seconds, v must equal -v_0. From the kinematics equation v = v_0 + at we have for the instant before it hits the ground, -v_0 = v_0 -gt -2v_0 = -gt andv_0 =gt/2 = [(32 ft/sec^2)(10 sec)]/2 = 160 ft/sec (b) The speed of the ball when it hits the ground is -v_0 or - 160 ft/sec. (c) The height reached by the ball can be obtained by realizing that the rise of the ball must take half the total time the ball is in the air, or 5 seconds. The average velocity for this part of the motion must be v = (v-_i +v_f_-)/2 = {(160 ft/sec) + (0 ft/sec)} /2 = 80 ft/sec. The height the ball rises is then d =vt= (80 ft/sec)(5 sec) = 400 ft. This result can also be obtained using the kinematics equation d = v_0t + (1/2) at^2 Substituting values, d = (160 ft/sec)(5 sec) + (1/2) (-32 ft/sec^2)(5 sec)^2 = 800 ft - 400 ft = 400 ft.", "ref_id": 4868, "meta_info": {"subject": "physics.csv", "src": "stemez-Physics", "question": "(a) With what speed must a ball be thrown directly upward so that it remains in the air for 10 seconds?
