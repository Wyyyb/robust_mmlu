This can be determined fromK_diss_' the equilibrium dissociation constants, which measures the ratio of products to reactants (i.e. their concentrations), each raised to the power of their co-efficients in the balanced chemical equation.

If the initial [HF] = 0.5, and x moles/liter dissociate to give [H_3O^+] and [F^-], then, at equilibrium, [HF] = 0.5 - x.

Solving for [H^+], [H^+] = 8.65 \u00d7 10^-3 = [F^-], Substituting these actual molar concentrations into the equilibrium constant expression, one obtains [(6.71 \u00d7 10^-4) / ( 8.65 \u00d7 10^-3)] = (8.65 \u00d7 10^-3) / [HF] Solving:[HF] = 0.112 at equilibrium [H^+] = 8.65 \u00d7 10^-3.

The chemical bond strength of NO decreases when an electron is removed.\nD. The chemical bond strength of NO remains the same when an electron is removed.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are two types of molecular orbitals: bonding and antibonding. A chemical bond is strengthened by electrons in bonding orbitals and weakened by electrons in antibonding orbitals. For every bonding orbital, there is a corresponding antibonding orbital. Each orbital can hold 2 electrons. Bond order measures bond strength by giving an indication of the number of electrons in bonding versus antibonding orbitals. Bond order is defined as one half the number of electrons in the bonding orbital less one half the number of electrons in the antibonding orbital. Thus, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. To find the original bond order, consider the valence electrons, the outermost electrons, since they are the only ones that participate in bonding. For N, Z = 7. Its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3. The outer-most electrons are in 2p^3. This means that in N^2 there are a total of six valence electrons. There exist 3 bonding p orbitals. They can accommodate the six valence electrons. Since no electrons need be in antibonding orbitals, bond order = (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (0) = 3. When an electron is removed, the bonding orbitals have only 5 electrons. Thus, the bond order becomes (1/2) (5) - (1/2) (0) = 2.5. Since the bond order went from 3 to 2.5, the bond is weakened by removing the electron from N_2. For O, Z = 8. Since its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4, each O atom has 4 valence electrons. O_2 has a total of 8 valence electrons. The three bonding p orbitals can hold only 6 .of these electrons. Thus, two electrons are in antibonding orbitals. The bond order is (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (2) = 2. When one removes an electron, it is removed from the antibonding orbitals, if electrons exist in such orbitals. Therefore, the O_2, after removal of the electron, has only 1 electron in an antibonding electron. This means the bond order becomes (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (1) = 2.5. The bond increased from 2 to 2.5, which means that bond strength increases when one removes an electron from O_2. To predict what happens to NO bond strength, consider the bond order before and after the electron removal. Recall, an O atom has 4 valence electrons and N has 3 valence electrons. The total in NO is seven. The 3 p bonding orbit-als can hold six of these electrons. This means 1 electron is in on antibonding orbital. Bond order = (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (1) = 2.5. If one removes one electron, the antibonding orbitals contain zero electrons. Thus, the bond order becomes (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (0) = 3.

A chemical bond is strengthened by electrons in bonding orbitals and weakened by electrons in antibonding orbitals. For every bonding orbital, there is a corresponding antibonding orbital. Each orbital can hold 2 electrons. Bond order measures bond strength by giving an indication of the number of electrons in bonding versus antibonding orbitals. Bond order is defined as one half the number of electrons in the bonding orbital less one half the number of electrons in the antibonding orbital. Thus, the higher the bond order, the stronger the bond. To find the original bond order, consider the valence electrons, the outermost electrons, since they are the only ones that participate in bonding. For N, Z = 7. Its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^3. The outer-most electrons are in 2p^3. This means that in N^2 there are a total of six valence electrons. There exist 3 bonding p orbitals. They can accommodate the six valence electrons. Since no electrons need be in antibonding orbitals, bond order = (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (0) = 3. When an electron is removed, the bonding orbitals have only 5 electrons. Thus, the bond order becomes (1/2) (5) - (1/2) (0) = 2.5. Since the bond order went from 3 to 2.5, the bond is weakened by removing the electron from N_2. For O, Z = 8. Since its electron configuration is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4, each O atom has 4 valence electrons. O_2 has a total of 8 valence electrons. The three bonding p orbitals can hold only 6 .of these electrons. Thus, two electrons are in antibonding orbitals. The bond order is (1/2) (6) - (1/2) (2) = 2.

When the swimmer leaves the cold water, he is, coated with water. As the water evaporates a layer of gaseous water molecules form around the swimmer's body. This vapor attains an equilibrium with the atmosphere which hinders further vaporization of the water. However, when the breeze comes, it blows away the vapor above the water, and thereby keeps the partial pressure of the vapor low above the skin. This, then, causes increased evapora-tion so that the partial pressure can be reestablished. This is true because the concentration and vapor pressure of the gaseous water, molecules must be below a certain point for evaporation to occur. Once thisponthas been reached no more liquid molecules of water can go into the gaseous state. For the water to evaporate, it must go from a liquid to a gaseous phase, a process which requires heat.

Three of them are given; we must calculate the fourth. These variables are governed by the ideal gas law. An ideal gas is one in which the molecules have no attraction for one another and the molecules themselves occupy no space (a situation contrary to fact). Real gases do not completely satisfy either of these conditions, but under conditions close to STP (0\\textdegreeC and 1 atm), the real gases come very close to meeting these conditions.

Moles is defined as grams/molecular weight. R is a gas constant equal to .082 (liter) - (atm)/(\\textdegreeK) - (mole).

From this, you can employ the mole concept to determine the weights of the substances involved. Given that oxygen is liberated and that oxygen gas exists as O^2 and not O, you can write the balanced equation 2KCLO_3 \\rightarrow 2KCL + 3O_2. All atoms are accounted for.

From this, you can employ the mole concept to determine the weights of the substances involved. Given that oxygen is liberated and that oxygen gas exists as O^2 and not O, you can write the balanced equation 2KCLO_3 \\rightarrow 2KCL + 3O_2. All atoms are accounted for. The coefficients indicate the relative number of moles that react. For example, every two moles of KCLO_3 yield 3 moles of oxygen. A mole is defined as weight in grams of a substance divided by its atomic or molecular weight. Therefore, you have [(.96 g) / (3 g/mole)] = .030 moles of oxygen.

(a) Bond strength is doubled, (b) Bond strength is quadrupled, (c) Bond strength is halved, (d) Bond strength is decreased by a factor of 4\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nWhen two ions come together to form an ionic bond, energy is released. The more energy released, the stronger the ionic bond. The amount of energy released is determined by the equation E = 1.44 (q_1q_2 / r) where E = energy in electron volts, q_1 = charge on the positive ion, q_2 = charge on the negative ion, and r = the distance between the nuclear centers. If one changes one parameter, another must adjust to maintain this e-quality. Solving: (a) If the charge on A, the positive ion, is doubled, the energy released is doubled. That is, 2E = 1.44 [(2q_1q_2)/ r] is equivalent to E = [(1.44 q_1q_2) / r]. If E is doubled, the strength of the chemical bond is doubled. (b) Using a similar line of reasoning, it is found that if one doubles both the positive and negative charges, four times E is released. The strength of the bond is, thus, 4 times as great as the original bond. (c) If one increases the radius of the ions then, the distance between their nuclei must also increase.

The more energy released, the stronger the ionic bond. The amount of energy released is determined by the equation E = 1.44 (q_1q_2 / r) where E = energy in electron volts, q_1 = charge on the positive ion, q_2 = charge on the negative ion, and r = the distance between the nuclear centers. If one changes one parameter, another must adjust to maintain this e-quality. Solving: (a) If the charge on A, the positive ion, is doubled, the energy released is doubled. That is, 2E = 1.44 [(2q_1q_2)/ r] is equivalent to E = [(1.44 q_1q_2) / r]. If E is doubled, the strength of the chemical bond is doubled. (b) Using a similar line of reasoning, it is found that if one doubles both the positive and negative charges, four times E is released. The strength of the bond is, thus, 4 times as great as the original bond. (c) If one increases the radius of the ions then, the distance between their nuclei must also increase.

Since water is a weak acid and weak base, which dissociates to H^+ and OH^- ions, it can react with ions from weak acids and bases. Such a process, termed hydrolysis, occurs in this problem. Because the problem asks for pH, one must determine the concentrations of the H_3O^+ or OH^- in this problem. This means that the hydrolysis reaction must be written and an equilibrium constant set up. The net hydrolysis reaction may be written as . C_2H_3O_2^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows HC_2H_3O_2 + OH^-. TheK_hydfor this reaction is {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] =K_w/K_diss. However,K_hydis defined asK_w/K_diss_' whereK_wis the dissociation constant for water andK_dissis the dissociation constant for the acid formed. One can equate the two to obtain {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] =K_w/K_diss. But the value ofK_wandK_dissis known. Therefore, {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-14)/(1.8 \u00d7 10^-5) = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-10. If one can find [OH^-], one can determine [H_3O^+] from [H_3O^+] [OH^-] =K_w= 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14. Therefore, let x = moles/liter of OH^-. From the hydrolysis reaction, one can see that for each mole of OH^- generated, a mole of HC_2H_3O_2 is also generated. Therefore, let x = [HC_2H_3O_2] also. If one starts with 0.1 M of C_2H_3O_2^-, and x moles/liter reacts to form OH^- (and C_2H_3O_2^-), then, at equilibrium, one has 0.1 - x moles/liter of C_2H_3O_2^- left. Substituting these values into the previous expression: (x \\bullet x) / (0.1 - x) = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-6. Solving for x, x = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-4 M. (assuming in this calculation that x is small, therefore approximating 0.1- x as 0.1.) To find [H^+], solve [H_3O^+] = K_W / [OH^-] = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-14)/(7.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 1.33 \u00d7 10^-11.

Since water is a weak acid and weak base, which dissociates to H^+ and OH^- ions, it can react with ions from weak acids and bases. Such a process, termed hydrolysis, occurs in this problem. Because the problem asks for pH, one must determine the concentrations of the H_3O^+ or OH^- in this problem. This means that the hydrolysis reaction must be written and an equilibrium constant set up. The net hydrolysis reaction may be written as . C_2H_3O_2^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows HC_2H_3O_2 + OH^-. TheK_hydfor this reaction is {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] =K_w/K_diss. However,K_hydis defined asK_w/K_diss_' whereK_wis the dissociation constant for water andK_dissis the dissociation constant for the acid formed. One can equate the two to obtain {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] =K_w/K_diss. But the value ofK_wandK_dissis known. Therefore, {[OH^-] [HC_2H_3O_2]} / [C_2H_3O_2^-] = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-14)/(1.8 \u00d7 10^-5) = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-10. If one can find [OH^-], one can determine [H_3O^+] from [H_3O^+] [OH^-] =K_w= 1.0 \u00d7 10^-14. Therefore, let x = moles/liter of OH^-. From the hydrolysis reaction, one can see that for each mole of OH^- generated, a mole of HC_2H_3O_2 is also generated. Therefore, let x = [HC_2H_3O_2] also. If one starts with 0.1 M of C_2H_3O_2^-, and x moles/liter reacts to form OH^- (and C_2H_3O_2^-), then, at equilibrium, one has 0.1 - x moles/liter of C_2H_3O_2^- left. Substituting these values into the previous expression: (x \\bullet x) / (0.1 - x) = 5.6 \u00d7 10^-6. Solving for x, x = 7.5 \u00d7 10^-4 M. (assuming in this calculation that x is small, therefore approximating 0.1- x as 0.1.) To find [H^+], solve [H_3O^+] = K_W / [OH^-] = (1.0 \u00d7 10^-14)/(7.5 \u00d7 10^-4) = 1.33 \u00d7 10^-11.

This is called Graham's law. Rate = constant / \\surdMW For HF:According to Graham's Law: the speed of NH_3 is proportional to 1 / \\surd17 = .243 (MW of NH_3 = 17) the speed of HF is proportional to 1 / \\surd20 = .224 (MW of HF = 20) Thus, for an arbitrary amount of time, let us say 1 min., NH_3 moves .243 cm and HF moves .224 cm. Because the gases are ejected from either end of the tube, after 1 minute the gases move (.243 + .224) cm or .467 cm/min. closer together. When this distance is equal to 100 cm the solid forms. One can determine the time needed by dividing 100 cm by .467 cm/min time after which solid forms = 100 cm / .467 cm/min = 214.13 min. Thus, after 214.13 min. the HF meets the NH_3. The distance the NH_3 would travel is found by multiplying the distance it travels in 1 minute, .243 cm, by the time elapsed till the NH_4F deposits. distance NH_3 travels = .243 cm/min \u00d7 214.13 min =52.03 cm. 52.03 cm. b) One solves for HCl in a similar manner MW of HCl =36.5 the speed of HCl is proportional to 1 / \\surd36.5 = .165 As previously found, the speed of NH_3 is proportional to 1/\\surd17 = .243. Speed is a measure of distance covered over a unit time. Let us designate the speeds here as cm./min. Thus, HCl moves .165 cm/min and NH_3 moves .243 cm/min.

Assume the following: the heat of combustion of gasoline is 5100 KJ/mole the density of gasoline is .703 g/cm^3; leV = 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J.\n\nOptions:\nA. 100 liters of gasoline\nB. 243 liters of gasoline\nC.             150 liters of gasoline\nD. 500 liters of gasoline\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe answer to this question involves several calculations. To determine the amount of gasoline which will yield an equal amount of energy upon combustion as one liter of water, first compute how much energy can be obtained from each. For gasoline, this entails calcula-tion of the number of moles per liter of the substance. Multiplication by the heat of combustion yields the total energy. For water, first determine, how many deuterium ions are present per liter and then, using conversion factors, multiply this by the energy re-leased per deuterium ion fused. To obtain the energy per liter of water, first find the number of deuterium ions. To obtain this, you need to first find the number of atoms of H per liter of water, since the density of water is defined as one and density = mass/volume, 1 liter H_2 O =1000 g H_2 O. The molecular weight of one mole of water is 18. Therefore, the number of moles of water in one liter is (1000) / (18) = 55.5 [(moles water) / (liter)].There are two moles of H atoms, per mole of water, since its molecular formula is H_2 O. Therefore, the number of moles of H atoms = [(55.5 moles water) / (liter)] \u00d7 [(2 mole H atoms) / (moles H_2O)] = (111 mole H atoms) / (liter). However, in a mole of anything, there are 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 particles, (Avogadro's number). Therefore, the total number of H atoms per liter of water is [(111 mole H atoms) / (liter)] \u00d7 6.02 \u00d7 10^23 (atoms/mole) = 6.68 \u00d7 10^25 (H atoms/liter) since you have 1 deuterium atom per 7000H atoms. Therefore, the number of deuterium atoms per liter of water is 6.68 \u00d7 10^25 (H atoms/liter) \u00d7 [(1 atom deuterium) / (7000 H atoms)] = 9.55 \u00d7 10^21 [D atoms/liter)] Since each deuterium atom yields 5MeV or 5 x 10^6 ev of energy, when it fuses to produce helium, the amount of energy per liter of water is 9.55 \u00d7 10^21 (D atoms/liter) \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^6 (ev/D atom) = 47.75 \u00d7 10^27 (ev/liter). Since, 1.60 \u00d7 10^-19 J = one ev = 1.60 \u00d7 10^-22 kJ, 47.75 \u00d7 10^27 (ev/liter) = 47.75 \u00d7 10^27 (ev/liter) \u00d7 1.60 \u00d7 10^-22 kJ/ev = 7.64 \u00d7 10^6 kJ/liter of energy per liter of water. To compute the energy in one liter of gasoline, remember that the density of gasoline equals mass of gasoline divided by its volume. Therefore, the mass of one liter of gasoline is (density \u00d7 volume) = .703 g/cm^3 \u00d7 1000 cm^3 = 703 g. Thus, there are 703 g/liter of gasoline. The molecular weight of gasoline is 142 grams per mole. Therefore, the number of moles of gasoline per liter is (703 g/l) / (142 g/mole) = 6.16 moles/liter for gasoline. The heat of combustion of gasoline is 5100 kJ/mole. Therefore, the energy per liter of gasoline is 6.16 moles/liter \u00d7 5100 kJ/mole = 31,400 kJ/liter = 3.14 \u00d7 10^4 kJ/liter. To find out how may liters of gasoline is equivalent to water in terms of energy, divide the energy of 1 liter H_2 O by the energy of 1 liter gasoline. For water, it is 7.64 \u00d7 10^6 kJ/l. For gasoline, it is 3.14 \u00d7 10^4 kJ/l.

As such, to determine how much limestone is necessary to react with 1 ton of clay, compute the number of moles of AI_2 O_3 and SiO_2 present. From this figure, the number of moles of CaCO_3 can be found. Because a mole is defined as grams divided by molecular weight (MW), the weight (grams) can be found once the molecular weight is calculated. It is given that 1 ton or 2000 1b of clay will be used.

To calculate the mole amounts, one must convert lbs to grams. This can be done by using the conversion factor 454 g/lb. Thus, 600 lbs \u00d7 454 g/lb = 2724 x 10^2 grams of Al_2 O_3 and 1100 \u00d7 454 g/lb = 4994 \u00d7 10^2 grams of SiO_2. The MW of Al_2 O_3 = 102 grams/mole.
