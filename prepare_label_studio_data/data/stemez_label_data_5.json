To simplify the equations, the followingsubstitutions are used: \\alpha' = [Dt/ (z_0^2)] W =x_A m = (z / z_0) wherethe distance z is taken perpendicular to the middle of the solid and z_0is half the width of the solid. Substituting into equation (2) provides: (\\partialW / \\partial\\alpha) = [(\\partial^2W) / (\\partialm^2)](3) It is now possible to postulate that the solution to this differential equation existsas the product of two terms: W = \\alpha' M(4) The term \\alpha' is a function of \\alpha, where time is variable, and M is solely a functionof m and therefore only depends on distance. Differentiating equation(4) gives: M (\\partial\\alpha' / \\partial\\alpha) = \\alpha' [(\\partial^2M) / (\\partialm^2)](5) or (1 / \\alpha') (\\partial\\alpha' / \\partial\\alpha) = (1 / M) [(\\partial^2M) / (\\partialm^2)](6) Time and distance are not dependent on each other. This implies that both sidesof the equation equal to a constant, - b^2. Therefore: (\\partial\\alpha' / \\partial\\alpha) + b^2\\alpha' = 0(7) and [(\\partial^2M) / (\\partialm^2)] + b^2M = 0(8) Equation (7) has a solution of: \\alpha' = G_1e^-(b)2 \\alpha(9) andequation (8) has a solution of: M = G_2 sinbm+ G_3cosbm(10) Therefore: W = a' M = G_1e-(b)2\\alpha(G_2 sinbm+ G_3cosbm)(11) whereG_1, G_2, and G_3 are constants. The boundary conditions forW(m, \\alpha) necessaryto evaluate the constants are: (I)(\\partialW / \\partialm) (0, \\alpha) = 0 (II)W(1, \\alpha) = 0 (III)W(m, 0) = 1.0 Taking the derivative \\partialW / \\partialm of equation (11) allows the first boundary conditionto be applied. (\\partialW / \\partialm) = G_1e-(b)2\\alpha(G_2bcosbm- G_3b sinbm)(12) Evaluating at m = 0 gives: (\\partialW / \\partialm) = bG_1G_2e-(b)2\\alpha(13) For this expression to equal zero, G_2 must be zero.Therefore : W = B e-(b)2cosbm(14) wherethe constant B combines G_1 and G_2. The second boundary conditioncan now be utilized. B e-(b)2\\alphacosb = 0 Many values of b satisfy this condition, for example, \\pi/2, 3\\pi/2,5\\pi/2. ... An infinite series of cosine terms can be written. W =B_1e^-(\\pi/2)2 \\alphacos(\\pi/2)m+ B_2e- (3\\pi/2)2 \\alphacos(3\\pi / 2) m + B_3e- (5\\pi/2)2 \\alphacos(5\\pi / 2) m + . . . + Bie- [(2i - 1) / (\\pi/2)}]2\\alphacos[{(2i - 1) \\pi} / 2] m(15) whereiis an integer. With the third boundary condition, equation (15) can bewritten: 1 = B_1cos(\\pi/2) m + B_2cos(3\\pi / 2) m + B_3cos(5\\pi / 2) m + ... + B_icos[(2i - 1) / 2]\\pim(16) Now multiply each side of this equation bycos[(2i - 1) / 2]\\pimdmand integratefrom 0 to 1.

Given that the compressor is a three stage compressor, the compression ratio of each stage is (p_o / p_i) = [(1000) / 11]^1/3 = 4.5 As a result of isentropic compression in each stage, the compressed gas at the outlet of each stage is at a higher temperature than at the inlet.
