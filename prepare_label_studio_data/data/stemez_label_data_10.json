The serial anticipation method is the typical method employed in paired-associate task experiments. In this method, the first item of the pair is presented alone, followed by both items of the pair presented together.

Paired-associate tasks are often considered easier than serial tasks because half of the items do not have to be anticipated; they merely serve as cues to signal the other half of the items. Also, in the paired-associate task, an item of the pair serves only one function: stimulus or response. In the serial task sequence, the middle item of A-B-C (\"B\") serves two functions.

The paired-associate task also allows us to look at the learning of a pair independently of its position in the list, unlike serial tasks. Another reason why psychologists favor paired-associate learning is that its experimental method is similar to nonverbal learning and conditioning experiments.

The duration of the tasks affects the type of transfer\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe degree of similarity of the stimuli and responses in two tasks is one of the most important variables determining whether transfer will be positive or negative. To investigate this variable, Bruce (1933) used paired-associate learning in his famous transfer experiment which has since been replicated by others. Bruce constructed lists of paired-associate stimulus-response items for two tasks. The condition of the paired-associate lists varied. In one experimental condition, the stimuli of tasks one and two were different, but the responses were identical. In another, the stimuli were identical but the responses were dissimilar. In other conditions, either the stimuli or responses in Task 2 were similar to those in Task 1. The results of this study show that very strong positive transfer results when the stimuli are similar and the responses are identical. In other words, the more that previous and future learning are similar, the more likely it is that positive transfer will result. In verbal learning, there is some positive transfer even when the stimuli are dissimilar but the response is the same. In general, the more similar the stimuli, the more likely it will be that positive transfer will occur. Positive transfer may also increase with the amount of similarity between responses in the original and new situation. For example, although the games of tennis and badminton are different, they require similar responses and skills which make learning easier. If, however, two responses are extremely dissimilar, negative transfer will result. For example, airplane accidents occasionally occur because a pilot will transfer a response he made on similar controls on a plane he flew previously to those of a new plane. Although the controls (stimulus) are similar, they require different responses. An accident created in this way is the result of negative transfer. In summary, some major points concerning stimulus-response similarity found in these experiments are: 1. Learning to make identical responses to new stimuli results in positive transfer. 2. Learning to make new (dissimilar, opposite or antagonistic) responses to similar or identical stimuli results in negative transfer. 3. The amount of transfer, regardless of whether it is positive or negative, is a function of stimulus similarity. 4.

In the evaluation and understanding of the results of an intelligence test it is necessary to consider the influence of personality variables. Thus, in order to determine if an IQ score will accurately predict an individual 's future academic achievement and intellectual development it is necessary to know if the individual's IQ score truly reflects his potential or his current intellectual development and academic achievement. If a child is \"depressive\" and therefore is poorly motivated then his performance on the IQ test may be impaired. The resultant IQ score may not reflect his true ability. The depressed child is often \"uncooperative\" in test situations. Similarly, an individual may not place any value on academic achievement or intelligence and therefore may not take the IQ test seriously. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the IQ score in measuring intelligence, the examiner must know the effects of intervening personality variables. The IQ score may deflate or even inflate the true extent of an individual's true intelligence. Moreover, even if the IQ score is accurate, an individual's personality may affect his future behavior in such a way as to prevent the accurate prediction of academic achievement based on the IQ score (the IQ score is usually used for the purposes of prediction). For example, in certain ethnic groups academic achievement is valued highly and therefore an individual belonging to that ethnic group may score near the mean on an IQ test but then perform above average in future academic achievement. Personality variables will always affect test behavior. So, even though there may not be a direct relation between intelligence and personality, it is almost certainly the case that personality affects test-taking behavior and therefore resultant scores may not be \"accurate.\" It is not the same to say that depressive people are less intelligent as it is to say that depressive people often receive lower intelligence test scores. One important relationship between personality and intelligence is the effect of high intelligence or high IQ on personality. More intelligent individuals tend to be more successful and success positively affects emotional adjustment, interpersonal relations, and self-concept. However, it is possible that only those intelligent people who are emotionally well adjusted, have a high self-concept, and who have good interpersonal relations are successful.

We would probably still be able to distinguish between them though each note's pitch is different. Our experiences of pitch and loudness are related to physical aspects of the actual stimulus. For instance, pitch is closely related to the 'frequency' of the stimulus. Sound is basically vibrations of particles in the air. These vibrations are wavelike and are called sound waves. They go up, down, up again, etc. The frequency of a vibration is a measure of how many times it goes up and down in a single period of time, usually a second. If a stimulus goes up and down many times in a second, we say it is a high frequency wave. We generally experience high frequency waves as high-pitched tones. Waves with low frequencies correspond to low-pitched tones. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is closely related to the intensity of the physical stimulus. Intensity is a measure of the amount of physical energy a stimulus sends to our senses. A high intensity sound sends a great deal of energy to our ear. We experience a high intensity sound as being \"loud.\" Similarly, a low intensity stimulus is perceived as \"soft.\" However, loudness is not directly related to intensity. Pitch is also not directly related to frequency. Other variables may participate in determining the loudness or pitch of a tone. For example, the intensity of a sound is also important in determining pitch. Increasing the intensity of a sound will often increase its pitch. Frequency may also play a part in determining loudness. In summary, frequency is very important in determining pitch. Intensity is closely related to experienced loudness.

If a stimulus goes up and down many times in a second, we say it is a high frequency wave. We generally experience high frequency waves as high-pitched tones. Waves with low frequencies correspond to low-pitched tones. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is closely related to the intensity of the physical stimulus. Intensity is a measure of the amount of physical energy a stimulus sends to our senses. A high intensity sound sends a great deal of energy to our ear. We experience a high intensity sound as being \"loud.\" Similarly, a low intensity stimulus is perceived as \"soft.\" However, loudness is not directly related to intensity. Pitch is also not directly related to frequency. Other variables may participate in determining the loudness or pitch of a tone. For example, the intensity of a sound is also important in determining pitch. Increasing the intensity of a sound will often increase its pitch. Frequency may also play a part in determining loudness. In summary, frequency is very important in determining pitch. Intensity is closely related to experienced loudness. However, other variables are involved in these experiences."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhy are parallel memory codes so important in the understanding of the role of memory in thought?\n\nOptions:\nA.

Thus there are different intensities of sweetness. This applies to other tastes as well. Three major factors influence the intensity of a taste. These are the concentration of the stimulus, the area of the tongue's surface that is stimulated, and other tastes present at the same time.

The second glass contains a more 'concentrated' mixture. This means it contains more salt in the same amount of liquid.

Another variable factor is the amount of tongue that is in contact with the stimulus. This can also affect the intensity of a taste. In general, the larger the area of tongue that is stimulated, the more intense is the taste. In addition, a process called 'contrast' can affect taste intensity. Two different parts of the tongue may be stimulated by two different tastes at the same time. For example, one can put a weak sugar and water mixture on one side of one's tongue, and a weak salt water mixture on the other. You will find that the salt mixture tastes more intense than it normally would. That is, if the sugar mixture were not there, the salt mixture would not have tasted as salty.

What is retroactive interference?\n\nOptions:\nA. Proactive interference refers to the inability to recall new information\nB. Proactive interference is the effect of prior learned items on the retention of information, indicating the importance of classification in retention. Retroactive interference refers to the effect the last items learned have on the retention of information.\nC.             Retroactive interference is the effect of new information on the recall of previously learned information\nD. Proactive interference is the effect of future learned items on the retention of information\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nIn studying the nature of retention and recall of information, one experiment presents three items to a subject and then distracts his attention for a brief period of time. After the first trial, retention is nearly perfect, but on subsequent trials recall deteriorates. It is thought that this occurs because the items that were stored in previous trials begin to confuse or interfere with the items from the current trial. This effect of prior learned items on the retention of information is called \"proactive interference.\" The type of item that is presented before a particular item also influences recall. This points strongly to the importance of classification in retention. If, for example, letters are presented for a number of trials and then numbers are presented, the numbers will be recalled with a high level of accuracy for the first few trials. This indicates that the memory of the letters does not interfere with the retention of the numbers and thus that they are likely to be stored in different parts of memory. This tendency for recall to improve when a change in category is made is called \"release from proactive interference.\" Interestingly, some of the categorical changes that produce release from proactive interference are not even noticed by the subjects. This may imply that items are stored in temporal order and that the difference in types of lists is used as a way to avoid confusion so that there is no interfering effect from a letter list when a number list is presented. One explanation for these findings is that different parts of memory handle different types of information and that temporal order is important. Whichever explanation is finally accepted, those findings are important to any theory about the development of memory structures (connected pieces of information which associatively give rise to one another). A study by Funkhouser showed further how classification at input affects retention. Subjects were shown pictures of simple objects such as chairs and trucks. The subjects were divided into groups. One group was asked to classify the objects by color, another by shape, and a third group was asked to make no classification. When this was completed, a brief distracting task was presented after which the subjects were asked to recall the items they had previously been shown. Some subjects were asked to recall using the same categories by which they had taken in the information; others were asked to recall using different categories. The speed and accuracy of recall for subjects who were permitted to recall using the same categories were far superior to that of the subjects who had to use different categories. This indicates that the classification that is made at the time of input of the material has a restricting influence on the way in which the material can be readily used. It is most accessible if it is associated with the same category; recall of the material becomes slow and laborious if it is needed in a different classification system. The term \"retroactive interference\" refers to the effect the last items learned have on the retention of information. Researchers have shown that the last few items learned tend to interfere with the earlier items. Thus, if the effects of proactive and retroactive interference are real, then the items in the middle of a long list should be the least likely to be recalled. This should be true because these items are subject to both proactive and retroactive interference.

What is retroactive interference?", "options": ["Proactive interference refers to the inability to recall new information", "Proactive interference is the effect of prior learned items on the retention of information, indicating the importance of classification in retention. Retroactive interference refers to the effect the last items learned have on the retention of information.", "Retroactive interference is the effect of new information on the recall of previously learned information", "Proactive interference is the effect of future learned items on the retention of information"], "answer": "B", "solution": "In studying the nature of retention and recall of information, one experiment presents three items to a subject and then distracts his attention for a brief period of time. After the first trial, retention is nearly perfect, but on subsequent trials recall deteriorates. It is thought that this occurs because the items that were stored in previous trials begin to confuse or interfere with the items from the current trial. This effect of prior learned items on the retention of information is called \"proactive interference.\" The type of item that is presented before a particular item also influences recall. This points strongly to the importance of classification in retention. If, for example, letters are presented for a number of trials and then numbers are presented, the numbers will be recalled with a high level of accuracy for the first few trials. This indicates that the memory of the letters does not interfere with the retention of the numbers and thus that they are likely to be stored in different parts of memory. This tendency for recall to improve when a change in category is made is called \"release from proactive interference.\" Interestingly, some of the categorical changes that produce release from proactive interference are not even noticed by the subjects. This may imply that items are stored in temporal order and that the difference in types of lists is used as a way to avoid confusion so that there is no interfering effect from a letter list when a number list is presented. One explanation for these findings is that different parts of memory handle different types of information and that temporal order is important. Whichever explanation is finally accepted, those findings are important to any theory about the development of memory structures (connected pieces of information which associatively give rise to one another). A study by Funkhouser showed further how classification at input affects retention. Subjects were shown pictures of simple objects such as chairs and trucks. The subjects were divided into groups. One group was asked to classify the objects by color, another by shape, and a third group was asked to make no classification. When this was completed, a brief distracting task was presented after which the subjects were asked to recall the items they had previously been shown. Some subjects were asked to recall using the same categories by which they had taken in the information; others were asked to recall using different categories. The speed and accuracy of recall for subjects who were permitted to recall using the same categories were far superior to that of the subjects who had to use different categories. This indicates that the classification that is made at the time of input of the material has a restricting influence on the way in which the material can be readily used. It is most accessible if it is associated with the same category; recall of the material becomes slow and laborious if it is needed in a different classification system. The term \"retroactive interference\" refers to the effect the last items learned have on the retention of information. Researchers have shown that the last few items learned tend to interfere with the earlier items. Thus, if the effects of proactive and retroactive interference are real, then the items in the middle of a long list should be the least likely to be recalled. This should be true because these items are subject to both proactive and retroactive interference. Experiments on memory have illustrated that this is exactly what happens when a subject is asked to recall a long list: the items at the beginning and at the end have a higher frequency of recall than those in the middle."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDiscuss two approaches that can be used in examining early language acquisition.\n\nOptions:\nA.

The IQ is highly unstable.\nB. The IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence.\nC.             IQ has no relation with intelligence.\nD. The IQ is a measure of emotional stability.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nStability of IQ refers to the consistency of 2 or more IQ scores for one individual. There are two significant variables to be considered in the question of IQ stability. These are the interval between the initial test and the retest and the age of the individual. The shorter the interval between test and retest, the more stable the IQ. The age of the individual in question is important because the older the person is at the time of the initial IQ test, the more accurate will that IQ score be. Intelligence continues to change both qualitatively and quantitatively during development and the greatest changes occur early in development. Therefore, the difference in intelligence between a 3 - year-old and a 4 - year-old is greater than between a 14 year old and a 15 year old. In general the IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence. In a Swedish study,Husen(1951) found a correlation of .72 between the best scores of 613 3rd grade boys and the test scores of the same individuals ten years later. TheFelsResearch Institute (Sontag, Baker, & Nelson, 1958) conducted a study and found a correlation of .83 between the Stanford-Binetscores of the same individuals at three and four years of age. At age 12 the scores had a correlation of .46 with the scores from age 3.Bradway, Thompson, and Cravens (1958) conducted a study and found that initial IQ's had a correlation of. 65 with 10 - year retests and .59 with 25 - year retests. It should be noted that the stability of the IQ is effectively the same as its reliability. Despite whatever faults the IQ tests may have, they do have impressive reliabilities. One explanation for the increasing stability of the IQ with age is provided by the cumulative nature of intellectual development. An individual's intellectual skills at any one age include all the skills and knowledge acquired at an earlier age plus all newly acquired skills and knowledge. Predictions of IQ from age 10 to 16 would thus be more accurate than from 3 to 9, because scores at 10 represent more than half of the skills present at age 16 whereas scores at age 3 include a much smaller proportion of the skills and knowledge present at age 9. J. E. Anderson refers to the phenomenon of the increasingly close relationship between IQ scores at different ages as age increases as the 'overlap hypothesis'. Prerequisite learning skills also contribute significantly to the general stability of the IQ because they play an important role in subsequent learning. The more progress a child has made in the acquisition of intellectual skills and knowledge the better will he profit from subsequent learning experiences and the more stable his IQ. One reason behind childhood intervention programs (e.g.,Headstart) is that they help to provide children with prerequisite learning skills. Environmental stability, i.e. whatever intellectual advantages or disadvantages that an individual had at one stage in his development tend to persist, also accounts for the stability of IQ between tests. However, when there is a large upward or downward shift in the IQ it is usually attributable to a major environmental change. These IQ changes mean, of course, that the child is developing at a faster or a slower rate than that of the normative population on which the test was standardized. Drastic changes in family structure (divorce, loss of parents), adoption into a foster home, and severe or prolonged illness all have negative effects on a child's intellectual development. In general, children from culturally disadvantaged environments tend to experience a downward shift in IQ whereas children from culturally enriched environments experienced a relative gain in IQ. Parental concern with a child's educational achievement and with his general welfare is quite important in accounting for shifts in IQ. Without parental concern, children are unmotivated to achieve and to acquire intellectual skills and knowledge. During the preschool years, emotional dependency on parents seems to have a negative effect on intellectual development and seems to be the principal condition associated with IQ loss. During the school years, IQ gains are associated with high achievement drive, competitive striving, and curiosity about nature, that is, those attributes which are characteristic of an independent child. All of the above traits, including emotional dependency, can probably be attributed to parental attitudes and child-rearing practices. Emotional stability in general tends to have a beneficial effect on IQ. One study showed that accelerators (people who had a high positive change in IQ) had better coping mechanisms than decelerators (people who had a high negative change in IQ ). That is, accelerators had an objective, constructive, realistic approach to dealing with problems and frustrations whereas the decelerators approached problems and frustrations with defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms are characterized by withdrawal, denial, rationalization, and distortion. It can be seen that though the IQ is a reasonably stable measure of intelligence and usually a good predictor of future intellectual performance, one must consider an individual's emotional and motivational characteristics to be sure of the accuracy and relevancy of any individual IQ score. Environmental factors are also important in considering the probable nature of an individual's future intellectual development. The purpose of determining the stability of an individual's IQ is to be able to anticipate whatever problems he might encounter in his intellectual development. When problems are anticipated it is often possible to develop intervention programs and to perhaps alter the course of an individual's intellectual development.", "ref_id": 2018, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Is the IQ a stable measure of intelligence ?", "options": ["The IQ is highly unstable.", "The IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence.", "IQ has no relation with intelligence.", "The IQ is a measure of emotional stability."], "answer": "B", "solution": "Stability of IQ refers to the consistency of 2 or more IQ scores for one individual.

One famous study concerning this aspect was done by Sherman and Key (1932) on a group of isolated mountain children which they call the \"Hollow Children.\" The Hollow Children lived in various isolated villages in the Blue Ridge Mountains about 180 miles west of Washington D.C. Interestingly, these villages had remained isolated in varying degrees for decades prior to the study. Sherman and Key chose four villages in the region to study. Each varied in its amount of contact with the outside world. For example, Colvin was the innermost village and was the most isolated. The other villages, in order of most isolation to least, were Needles, Rigby, and Oakton. Each of these villages varied in the amount of schooling available. The researchers found that Colvin provided the least amount of schooling. During the 12 years previous to the study, a school had been open a total of only 16 months. It was found that only three of the adult residents were literate. In Rigby, which was closer to civilization, a school had been open for 66.5 months during the same amount of time. Many of the adults here were literate and there was a post office which provided some contact with civilization. A village calledBriarsvillewhich was located at the foot of the mountain was much less isolated than the mountain villages and was used as a control group for the study. The researchers used various intelligence tests such as the Stanford-Binetand the Good enough Draw-A-Man test, to compare the intellectual ability of the extremely isolated children in Calvin to the less isolated children inBriarsville.

The development of most of our basic behavior patterns is the result of maturation, not learning. For example, motor abilities--those that involve the use of limb muscles--mature. Walking, the most important motor development, is an ability that matures rather than something which is learned. Motor skills which lead up to walking occur in a definite sequence. Studies indicate that this sequence holds for all humans. Several studies have also shown that infants who are restricted in movement for a great amount of time (and therefore have no opportunity to practice motor skills) develop them at the same rate as infants who are given a great deal of freedom of movement and opportunity for practice. From this evidence it can be concluded that motor development results from maturation, not learning.

Sensory deprivation has no effect on development\nD. Sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nSensory deprivation often occurs outside the laboratory, most notablyin social settings. The effects of sensory deprivation in such an environmentwere reported by Spitz (1945). He compared the developmentof children in an orphanage, where there was little sensory stimulation, to that of children who were raised in a nursing home and receiveda great deal more care and stimulation. The children in both homes received the same nutrition and medicalcare and lived in sanitary environments. The children in the orphanage, however, received less maternal stimulation, which has been foundto be a necessary factor in normal development. Here, six nurses caredfor 45 babies. In the nursing home, on the other hand, each mother tookcare of her own child. The babies in the orphanage received less visual stimulation than thebabies in the nursing home.

However, during the last four months of the first year, the orphanagebabies received lower scores on the same tests. This discrepancyin the scores shows that both groups began with basically the samepotential, but dissimilarities in their environments influenced differencesin test scores.

Meaningfulness is measured by the number of associations they evoked.\nD. The more complex the material, the easier it is to learn\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nOne of the most important factors in verbal learning is the meaningfulnessof the material. An item is made meaningful by the associationsit evokes for the subject. These associations vary in their numberand in the way they are interrelated. Each item to be learned, a wordor nonsense syllable, evokes a number of associations. Some items elicitmore associations than others. For example, a subject may associate theitem BIK with bike, aBicpen or bicker. But the item BQR may mean absolutelynothing to him. The greater the number of associations elicited, the easier it is to learnand retain material because its meaningfulness is increased. If only avery few or no associations are evoked by an item, learning is difficult becausethe material is less meaningful to the learner. These points were illustratedby Noble (1952a, 1952b). The experimenters constructed a long listcontaining two syllable English words and two syllable nonsense words. An index of meaning was obtained for each word in the following manner: A group of subjects looked at the list, one word at a time, for 60 seconds, and reported their own lists of associations for each word. An indexof meaning was obtained for each item by counting the average numberof associations given by the group. Indices ranged from a low of 0.99 associations for the nonsense word \"govey\" to 9.61 associations for theword \"kitchen.\" On the basis of these indices, three lists of words were constructed. One list had an average \"meaningful index\" of 1.28, a second hadan index of 4.42, and a third had an index of 7.85. Subjects were then compared on their rate of learning the lists by theserial anticipation method. As required by the method, each word was presentedin a specific order a number of times. After the subject learned thelist, the first word was presented and the subject had to anticipate the nextone. When the following word was presented, he had to anticipate theone after that and so on. The list with the lowest \"meaningful index\" tookalmost three times as many trials to learn as the list with the highest index. The list with the intermediate index was between the extremes. The number of words in each list was the same. The only significantdifference was meaningfulness as measured by the number of associationsthey evoked. Therefore, the more meaningful something is, theeasier it is to learn and retain it. Other variables also affect the meaningfulness of verbal material. A verbalitem is more meaningful and easier to learn if it is similar to a word inthe subject's language. For example, an English-speaking subject may findthe word BIK easier to learn than BQR because the former is similar tothe types of words found in his native language. Meaningfulness also depends upon the familiarity the learner has withan item. An item which has been experienced more frequently will havegreater meaningfulness and will therefore be easier to learn. The lettersBIK have probably been seen more frequently by English-speakers thanBQR. Also, the more easily an item is pronounced, the greater meaningfulnessit has. BIK is easily pronounced as one unit but B-Q-R requiresthree separate responses. In paired-associate task experiments, the more meaningful the responseitem, the faster the learning rate. Meaningfulness can be facilitatedby coding material to make it more meaningful. For example, to learnBQR, it might be helpful to create a sentence such as Beautiful Queens are Rich.

The experimental technique that has probably provided the most information in this area is one that involves the use of thetachtiscope. Thetachtiscopeis an instrument that permits visual material to be presented to a subject for a brief duration--usually less than 1/4 second, which is the length of time required for a single visual fixation.

One result that has been duplicated in experimental situations is the effect of familiarity and specifically of language-frequency on the recognition threshold of words. The Thorndike-Lorge, which is a listing of the frequency of use of English words, is used to determine the frequency of a given word.

The most commonly accepted today is the fragment theory. Fragment theory supposes that when a word is briefly presented to a subject he only sees a fragment of it. From this fragment he makes an educated \"guess\" as to what the word might be. He is much more likely to choose a familiar word, one that occurs frequently in common usage, that incorporates the fragment that he saw. Many predictions that can be made from this theory have been supported by experiment. Even rare words have low thresholds if there are no similar common words. If two words have the same general appearance, the rare word will have a higher threshold and the common word will be more often offered as an incorrect response to the stimulus. On the other hand, an equally rare word that does not have a common word similar to it, will not have such a high threshold.

From this fragment he makes an educated \"guess\" as to what the word might be. He is much more likely to choose a familiar word, one that occurs frequently in common usage, that incorporates the fragment that he saw. Many predictions that can be made from this theory have been supported by experiment. Even rare words have low thresholds if there are no similar common words. If two words have the same general appearance, the rare word will have a higher threshold and the common word will be more often offered as an incorrect response to the stimulus. On the other hand, an equally rare word that does not have a common word similar to it, will not have such a high threshold. This theory about word familiarity and recognition belongs to a school of theories that maintain that cognition begins with incomplete stimulus information and proceeds from there to create a structured and meaningful world."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDefine language.

Both Raven's Progressive Matrices andCattell'sCulture Fair Intelligence Test were constructed as measures of \"g\". Multiple-factor theory accounts for another theory of intelligence. Here intelligence is viewed as consisting of a set of traits or factors. These traits are organized by group factors. A group factor is a factor that is common to a group of activities; a group factor may account for success in a number of related activities. For example, a verbal factor is a group factor that accounts for varying degrees of success on a vocabulary test, verbal analogies test, and a reading comprehension test.Thurstonewas one of the leading exponents of multiple-factor theory.Thurstone proposed about a dozen group factors which he designated as \"primary mental abilities\". These are: verbal comprehension, word fluency, number, space, associative memory, perceptual speed, and induction or general reasoning. A third theory of intelligence is referred to as a hierarchical theory of intelligence. Its proponents are Burt, Vernon, and Humphreys. Hierarchical theory is basically an alternative method of organizing the factors that determine intelligence. Spearman's g-factor is placed at the top of the hierarch. Two broad group factors, verbal- educational and practical-mechanical, are at the next level. On the next level there are other more specific group factors.

The abilityto transfer learning is also very important. The longer the list of items to be learned, the more difficult learning thelist becomes.

The ease with which we learn something also depends on the meaningfulnessof the material. The more meaningful it is, the better it is learnedand retained. Meaningfulness of material is derived from how manyassociations the material can evoke and from the conceptual and hierarchicalrelations among its items. Similarity, though it sounds like a single variable, actually encompassesthree variables. Verbal units may be similar in that they look orsound alike, have the same meaning or belong to the same category. Studies have shown that learning a list of items becomes more difficultas the similarity in meaning or appearance of its items increases. A list containing the words sad, unhappy, depressed, miserable, burdened, withdrawn, gloomy and frowning is a much harder list to learn thana list containing adjectives which are not similar. Likewise, a list containingthe words bike, back, buck, bake, book is harder to learn than bike, front, cook, deer, read. Similarly in appearance, meaning or category between stimulus andresponse items also inhibits learning in paired-associate task experiments. It has been found that in paired-associate learning, similarity ofstimulus items has a greater inhibiting effect on learning than similarity ofresponse items. Frequency seems to act in the same way as meaningfulness. One isbetter able to differentiate the acquired characteristics of frequently seenwords so that they are easily recalled.

These tasks require the performance of integrated, coordinated movements guided by perceptual input. Accomplishment of these skills relies equally on both the perceptual and motor systems. The many skills one learns in a lifetime which depend upon eye, foot and hand coordination are basically derived from the learning of two complex, basic patterns of motor functioning: bipedal locomotion (walking) and reaching-grasping-manipulation. Although it is \"natural\" for human beings to accomplish these skills, each individual must learn to coordinate his sensory, nervous and muscular functioning by exercise and practice. The development of many skills depends upon a combination of maturational limits and cultural determinants. The neuromuscular system of the child must be mature if he is to learn to walk, run and develop other more complex skills.

He learns to order adjectives by correctly saying a sentence such as, \"The two blue cars,\" rather than \"The blue two cars.\" During this period, word classes differentiate into subclasses and the child eventually incorporates and uses all the parts of speech in language: noun, verb, adjective, etc. During the third year, the child learns transformations. He can take a simple declarative sentence and transform it into a command, a question, or a negative. By applying the transformational rules that he has now incorporated, he can transform a sentence such as \"He goes,\" into \"Did he go?\" or \"He did not go.\" The child is now at a much more advanced stage than in infancy when he merely attached the word \"no\" to the beginning or end of a sentence to form the negative.

He learns to order adjectives by correctly saying a sentence such as, \"The two blue cars,\" rather than \"The blue two cars.\" During this period, word classes differentiate into subclasses and the child eventually incorporates and uses all the parts of speech in language: noun, verb, adjective, etc. During the third year, the child learns transformations. He can take a simple declarative sentence and transform it into a command, a question, or a negative. By applying the transformational rules that he has now incorporated, he can transform a sentence such as \"He goes,\" into \"Did he go?\" or \"He did not go.\" The child is now at a much more advanced stage than in infancy when he merely attached the word \"no\" to the beginning or end of a sentence to form the negative. During preschool age, the child learns the proper use of articles as well as the proper time to use singular or plural nouns. He learns that \"a box\" is correct but \"a money\" isn't; he begins to understand that \"two men\" is properpluralization, not \"two mans.\" Vocabulary becomes more extensive during the preschool period.

A hormone is a type of organ\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe endocrine system constitutes the second great communicating system of the body, with the first being the nervous system. The endocrine system consists of ductless glands which secrete hormones. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. The hormone is carried via the circulation to other sites of the body where its actions are exerted. Hormones are typically carried in the blood from the site of production to the site(s) of action, but certain hormones produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus act directly on their target areas without passing through the blood. The distance travelled by hormones before reaching their target area varies considerably. In terms of chemical structure, hormones generally fall into two categories: steroids and amino acid derivatives. The latter ranges in size from small molecules containing several peptides to very large proteins. Hormones serve to control and integrate many body functions such as reproduction, organic metabolism and energy balance, and mineral metabolism. Hormones also regulate a variety of behaviors, particularly sexual behaviors. To determine whether a gland is responsible for a particular function or behavior, an investigator usually begins by surgically removing the gland and observing the effect upon the animal. The investigator would then replace the gland with one transplanted from a closely related animal, and determine whether the changes induced by removing the gland can be reversed by replacing it. When replacing the gland, the experimenter must be careful to ensure that the new gland becomes connected with the vascular system of the recipient. This must be done so that secretions from the transplanted gland can enter the blood of the recipient. The experimenter may then try feeding dried glands to an animal from which the gland was previously removed. This is done to see if the hormone can be replaced in the body in this manner. The substance in the glands will enter the blood stream via the digestive system and be carried to the target organ by the circulatory system. Finally, the experimenter may make an extract of the gland and purify it to determine its chemical structure. Very often the chemical structure of a substance is very much related to its function.

The endocrine system consists of ductless glands which secrete hormones. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. The hormone is carried via the circulation to other sites of the body where its actions are exerted. Hormones are typically carried in the blood from the site of production to the site(s) of action, but certain hormones produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus act directly on their target areas without passing through the blood. The distance travelled by hormones before reaching their target area varies considerably. In terms of chemical structure, hormones generally fall into two categories: steroids and amino acid derivatives. The latter ranges in size from small molecules containing several peptides to very large proteins. Hormones serve to control and integrate many body functions such as reproduction, organic metabolism and energy balance, and mineral metabolism.

It is exclusively related to language acquisition.\nB. The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished.\nC.             It is only associated with punishment, not reward.\nD. It involves only the presence of a single stimulus.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe essential feature of discrimination learning is not whether a person can learn a particular response but rather, can he respond differentially to two or more stimuli? Infants learn discriminations in the same way that animals do during experimentation. The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished. In this way, after many occurrences, the infant learns to distinguish between a real puppy and a toy puppy, milk and solid food, etc. If the infant touches both a puppy and a toy puppy, the puppy will reward the infant by responding to his touch, whereas, touching the toy dog will result in an absence of reward (no response). Eventually, the infant learns to discriminate between the two types of dogs, real and toy. It is believed that these discriminations must take place before the acquisition of language; that is, before the infant can attach verbal labels to different stimuli. Since discrimination learning takes place during daily life, it is difficult to study its development. Therefore, psychologists have constructed situations where it can be studied in a controlled manner. Three of these situations are: probability learning, incidental learning, and reversal learning. The learning of discriminations in daily life is probabilistic. Both the stimuli to be discriminated and the reinforcements attached to them vary from situation to situation. For example, something white in a glass is probably milk, but not always. Human beings engage in a phenomenon known as probability matching, where the probability of a response matches the probability of an event. For example, a subject is presented with a panel which has two lights and is told to predict which light will come on first. The experimenter arranges the apparatus so that the second light comes on 75% of the time. The subject will start by predicting at a chance level (50% of the time), but as training progresses he will predict that the second light will come on just about as often as it actually does. An everyday typical discrimination situation is not only probabilistic, but it also involves multiple cues. The stimulus has more than one aspect which can be discriminated. For example, if a person is told that a certain movie theater is on the corner of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, he will notice the street signs when he gets there as well as the different things he sees on his way: the coffee shops, people, and other aspects of the environment. In intentional learning the subject discriminates between the cues given to him. What he learns is determined by what he wants to learn, what instructions are given to him, and what his prior experiences are. Incidental learning refers to the formation of an unintended discrimination. In the example above, learning that the theater is on the corner of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue was intentional, but noticing that there were two coffee shops across the street and a boutique around the corner was incidental. In learning discriminations with multiple cues, one learns primarily those that one intends to learn. But depending on how much attention one is paying to other things, one might learn much about the other cues. In reversal learning more than one cue is involved in discrimination. In this process, after one discrimination has been established, the subject shifts to a task that is either the reverse of the first or is the same as the first but with a shift in the cues utilized. Kendler and Kendler's (1962) experiment illustrates this: Children were presented with two cups at a time. The cups were different in both size and color. On one trial a large black cup might be paired with a small white cup, or a large white cup with a small white cup, etc. In the first task, the children had to choose either large cup regardless of color. In the second task, one-half of the group was reinforced for making a reversal shift; the small cup was now the correct choice. The same attribute (size) was relevant, but its value was reversed. The other half of the group made a non-reversal shift: another attribute -- color -- became relevant. With lower organisms and young children, the reversal shift is difficult, and the non-reversal shift is relatively easy. But with older children and adults the opposite is true. The reason for this is believed to be the difference in verbal capacity. Young children do not depend upon language in mediational processes to the same extent that adults do. \"Mediation\" refers to the process of words, images or associations, internally aroused, acting as a link in making discriminations. For example, the mediating word for the attributes \"black\" and \"white\" is \"color.\" This is an abstract process which children find difficult or impossible to do. Because young children lack mediational facility, they learn non-reversal shifts more easily than reversal shifts. A reversal shift requires \"unlearning\" and then \"reversing\" original learning, but a non-reversal shift requires only that the relevant attribute of the first learning be ignored. As his verbal ability increases with age, the older person is better able to make discriminations which are linked to a verbal response. The discrimination task becomes one of classifying attributes according to a relevant concept (in this example, size). In a reversal shift, the same concept is required; nothing new has to be learned. For example, if the mediating concept is size and the original relevant attribute is \"large,\" the new relevant attribute would be \"small\" after a reversal shift. However, a non-reversal shift for the person with verbal facility requires that he extinguish his original learningthat size was important and recognize another attribute as being relevant to reinforcement, such as color. Thus, discriminations linked to a verbal response enable those with verbal facility (older children and adults) to learn reversal shifts with more ease.", "ref_id": 2057, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What is involved in human discrimination learning?", "options": ["It is exclusively related to language acquisition.", "The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished.", "It is only associated with punishment, not reward.", "It involves only the presence of a single stimulus."], "answer": "B", "solution": "The essential feature of discrimination learning is not whether a person can learn a particular response but rather, can he respond differentially to two or more stimuli?

The Interference Theory would expect a significant difference in the amount recalled on a retention test, between the two groups of subjects. Those subjects who remain active during the retention interval are expected to suffer interference from the activity they engaged in after their original learning task. Following a statement of hypotheses, an experimental situation should be designed. Step 2: Experimental design method Subjects:Two groups of subjects should be employed: a control group - subjects who rest after an initial learning task, and an experimental group - subjects who enegage in an activity after an initial learning task. Procedure:(a) Present learning task A to the control and experimental groups. (b) During a given retention interval (e.g., 2 hours), allow the control group to rest, while the experimental group works on learning task B. (c) Present a learning task A retention test to both groups of subjects. Step 3: Results If the results of the learning task A retention test indicate that both groups of subjects recall the same amount from learning task A, then the findings would support the Decay Theory. The results would prove that regardless of the activities a subject engages in, the mere passage of time progressively fades memories, thus causing \"forgetting.\" In contrast, if the results of the learning task A retention test show that the experimental group recalls a significantly fewer amount than the control group, then the results would support the Interference Theory. It would provide evidence that learning task B caused response competition, indicating that interference from other memories causes \"forgetting.\""}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat is meant by the termconsciousness ?\n\nOptions:\nA.

It does this through information about the movements and position of our head. There are two groups of vestibular organs. These are the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans. There are three semicircular canals. They are located in the inner part of our ear. Each one lies in a different plane.

Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nIn her studies of three New Guinea tribes, Margaret Mead (1935) found that personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending upon the culture. Mead was particularly interested in the differences between the sexes in each society and found distinct differences in the expected modes of behavior for males and females among the three cultures. The three tribes Mead studied were theArapesh, theMundugumor, and theTchambulitribes. She found that both sexes in theArapesh culture were \"placid and contented, unaggressive andnoninitiatory, noncompetitive and responsive, warm, docile, and trusting.\" In contrast, Mead found that both the men and women of theMundugumortribe \"developed as ruthless, aggressive, positively sexed individuals, with the maternal cherishing aspects of personality at a minimum.\" In the third tribe, theTchambuli, she found a \"genuine reversal of the sex attitudes of our own culture.\" Hence, we see three cultures, each with its unique standard for appropriate behavior. In theArapeshtribe, \"feminine\" behavior is the norm for both sexes; in theMundugumor, \"masculine\" behavior is the norm for both; in theTchambuli, males are \"feminine\" and females are \"masculine.\" When discussing personality as it relates to culture, one should look at the environment of a society, since this largely determines the kind of society which develops. TheArapeshwere an agricultural tribe. They inhabited the sterile mountain regions some distance away from the coast of New Guinea. TheMundugumorwere cannibalistic. They lived along the banks of a fierce jungle river called the Sepik, which they greatly feared. Like theArapesh, theTchambuliwere an agricultural tribe. They were a highly artistic people. In this culture, where the appropriate behavior of the sex roles was \"reversed,\" the men were in charge of the artistic activities while the women were engaged in the practical work necessary for survival. While the men spent a great deal of their time practicing various ceremonial dances and experimenting with various art forms, the women gathered food. From her studies, Mead believed that the development of such personality traits as masculinity andfeminityare not dependent on the individual's sex, but rather on his particular cultural environment--the values, beliefs, and standards of behavior of the society in which he lives. This is not to say that everyone in a particular culture accepts and lives by its rules; there are always those individuals who are considered deviant. Yet it has been found that most of the people within a given culture adhere to the accepted modes of behavior, since it is quite often the case that refusal to adhere to norms results in rejection, abandonment, and hostility from the other members of the society.", "ref_id": 2067, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Discuss Mead's (1935) study of three New Guinea tribes.

In theArapeshtribe, \"feminine\" behavior is the norm for both sexes; in theMundugumor, \"masculine\" behavior is the norm for both; in theTchambuli, males are \"feminine\" and females are \"masculine.\" When discussing personality as it relates to culture, one should look at the environment of a society, since this largely determines the kind of society which develops. TheArapeshwere an agricultural tribe. They inhabited the sterile mountain regions some distance away from the coast of New Guinea. TheMundugumorwere cannibalistic. They lived along the banks of a fierce jungle river called the Sepik, which they greatly feared. Like theArapesh, theTchambuliwere an agricultural tribe. They were a highly artistic people. In this culture, where the appropriate behavior of the sex roles was \"reversed,\" the men were in charge of the artistic activities while the women were engaged in the practical work necessary for survival. While the men spent a great deal of their time practicing various ceremonial dances and experimenting with various art forms, the women gathered food. From her studies, Mead believed that the development of such personality traits as masculinity andfeminityare not dependent on the individual's sex, but rather on his particular cultural environment--the values, beliefs, and standards of behavior of the society in which he lives. This is not to say that everyone in a particular culture accepts and lives by its rules; there are always those individuals who are considered deviant. Yet it has been found that most of the people within a given culture adhere to the accepted modes of behavior, since it is quite often the case that refusal to adhere to norms results in rejection, abandonment, and hostility from the other members of the society."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDiscuss the long-term memory process, including the methods for measuring long-term memory retention.\n\nOptions:\nA. Long-term memory has limited storage capacity.\nB. Long-term memory can only be measured through recall.\nC.             Long-term memory cannot be disrupted by interference effects.\nD. Long-term memory can hold large amounts of material permanently and can be measured through recall, recognition, and savings methods.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nIn contrast to STM, long-term memory (LTM) is capable of holding large amounts of material permanently. Information that is needed every day, as one's telephone number, vocabulary, one's birthdate, etc., is stored in LTM and retrieved when needed. Information that has been rehearsed in short-term memory is transferred to the more permanent LTM store. There are three ways to measure the amount of LTM retention: recall, recognition and savings. The recall method requires that the subject reproduce something learned in the past with a minimum of cues. This is the most difficult way to remember information; therefore, the smallest amount of retention is measured with this method. When a student is asked to take an essay examination, for example, the instructor is utilizing the recall method of retention. The recognition method is another frequently used method of measuring retention. The subject must recognize whether or not he has been exposed to the information before. This method is most frequently used in multiple-choice examinations. There is, however, a chance factor that the student may correctly guess the answer without really remembering the information, thereby inflating the amount of retention measured. The third method of studying long-term memory retention, and the one most frequently used by psychologists in experimental studies on retention, is the savings method. The subject is required to learn something that he has already learned before. The measure of retention is the difference between the time or number of trials required for original mastery and the time or number of trials required for the second learning. For example, if it took 40 tries to learn a list of digits the first time, but only 20 tries the second time, the savings would be 50 percent. The savings method shows retention long after other methods have stopped showing retained material. In one study (Burtt, 1941), a psychologist read his 15 month-old son passages in Greek each day for three months. When the boy was 8 years old, he was required to learn the same selections in addition to new ones. The results showed that the old selections were learned in less time than the new ones. Therefore, exposure (even in infancy) to complex \"nonsense\" material resulted in savings at a later date. Although it may be difficult to recall material previously learned, if the opportunity to relearn or use the material again is presented, a considerable amount of savings may be found. LTM may be disrupted by interference effects. Retroactive inhibition (interference) occurs when the retention of information is interfered with because of activities which occurred after the initial learning. For example, a person who goes to a big party and learns the names of many new people may forget names learned early in the evening because the ones learned later will interfere with the early learning. However, if he forgot the names of the people he learned later in the evening, proactive inhibition (interference) may be taking place.

These are considered the four skin senses. Psychologists are not certain that specific receptors in the skin correspond to specific skin senses. However, the following distinctions do appear fairly certain. It seems that free nerve fibers located in the skin are responsible for our temperature sensations. The temperature of our skin is generally slightly lower than that of our blood. Free nerve fibers in the skin respond to changes in the difference between skin and blood temperature. For example, the temperature of our blood is roughly 38\\textdegreeC. The skin temperature of our forearm is usually 33\\textdegreeC. This is a 5\\textdegree difference.

The increase is what the free nerves respond to. You will then feel cold. It seems that there are specific nerve fibers responding to either heat or cold.

It is believed to respond to touch in those body regions that have hair. Finally, small capsules calledPaciniancorpuscles are thought to respond when deep pressure is applied to the skin. The stimulus that the above pressure receptors respond to is the bending or deforming of part of our skin. Therefore, when one first puts a watch on, you feel it. Immediately after, though, you \"forget\" that it is there. The initial bending of the skin that the watch caused was relayed to your brain by one of the pressure receptors. Therefore, you felt it.

Iconic concepts represent 'universals' by disregarding the general category of the memory.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nA concept is said to be formed when an individual is able to respond to a series of different impressions or events with the same label. There is often a common element in the different events that permits this concept formation. For example, we learn to respond to a number of different two and three-dimensional impressions with the label \"man,\" and to many different four-legged animals as \"cat.\" \"Iconic\" or visual concept formation appears to be of an abstractive nature. A visual image presented to a person appears to be compared to memories of similar past events and finally stored or assimilated as part of the overall concept of which it is a part. A study done byBahrickand Boucher demonstrates this aspect of iconic memory. Subjects were shown lists of visual patterns of familiar objects in common categories such as \"tables.\" One group of subjects was required to name the object at the time of learning and the other was not. Subjects were then tested either immediately after exposure to the lists or six weeks later. They were first asked to recall the name of the particular objects and then they were asked to pick out from a group of similar objects the exact item they had seen. The group that had verbalized the names of the items did much better with verbal recall of what they had seen when they were tested immediately, but when the testing occurred after six weeks, there was no difference in the verbal recall of the two groups. Apparently, the ability to recall after six weeks was strongly related to the calling forth of a visual image and then finding the name that corresponded to the image. It was also discovered that the ability to remember the name of the object was completely unrelated to the ability to select the correct table from the many tables presented. Further, subjects had an extremely difficult time recognizing the precise table. They seemed to have placed the impression of the table into the general category of \"tables\" so that the name could be recalled, but not the exact representation of the table. It was concluded from these results that the objects that were seen had become a part of a visual system--or iconic structure--that represented the concept of table. This ability of the mind to go from the particular to the general reduces the probability that one will be able to rememberthe exact details of what was seen. However, it does make it possible to handle more information and provides an economical storing mechanism. It also gives a code with which to think.

There is often a common element in the different events that permits this concept formation. For example, we learn to respond to a number of different two and three-dimensional impressions with the label \"man,\" and to many different four-legged animals as \"cat.\" \"Iconic\" or visual concept formation appears to be of an abstractive nature. A visual image presented to a person appears to be compared to memories of similar past events and finally stored or assimilated as part of the overall concept of which it is a part. A study done byBahrickand Boucher demonstrates this aspect of iconic memory. Subjects were shown lists of visual patterns of familiar objects in common categories such as \"tables.\" One group of subjects was required to name the object at the time of learning and the other was not. Subjects were then tested either immediately after exposure to the lists or six weeks later. They were first asked to recall the name of the particular objects and then they were asked to pick out from a group of similar objects the exact item they had seen. The group that had verbalized the names of the items did much better with verbal recall of what they had seen when they were tested immediately, but when the testing occurred after six weeks, there was no difference in the verbal recall of the two groups. Apparently, the ability to recall after six weeks was strongly related to the calling forth of a visual image and then finding the name that corresponded to the image. It was also discovered that the ability to remember the name of the object was completely unrelated to the ability to select the correct table from the many tables presented. Further, subjects had an extremely difficult time recognizing the precise table. They seemed to have placed the impression of the table into the general category of \"tables\" so that the name could be recalled, but not the exact representation of the table. It was concluded from these results that the objects that were seen had become a part of a visual system--or iconic structure--that represented the concept of table. This ability of the mind to go from the particular to the general reduces the probability that one will be able to rememberthe exact details of what was seen. However, it does make it possible to handle more information and provides an economical storing mechanism. It also gives a code with which to think.

Recall and Recognition\nB. Encoding and Retrieval\nC.             Interference and Time-Decay\nD. Rehearsal and Forgetting\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nMaterial in short-term memory has a very short life span if it is not reinforced by conscious rehearsal (repeating the information to oneself). Two theories that explain the brief recall ability of this memory system are the \"interference\" and the \"time-decay\" explanations. The interference model can be understood by assuming that short-term memory has a set number of spaces in which it can hold information. When the information that is entering is greater than the space available, some items are forgotten or replaced by the new information. Generally, the items that are forgotten are those in the middle of the list. This is because what is learned first usually interferes with what comes later (proactive interference) and what is learned later usually interferes with what came earlier (retroactive interference). Thus, it is the items in the middle that are most susceptible to forgetfulness. Some theorists have also tried to explain the limited capacity of short-term memory by supposing that the longer an item stays in memory, he weaker it becomes until finally it can no longer be recalled at all. This process would be analogous to an electricalcapacitatorwhose charge decays with time: each unit of time would weaken the traces of the previously acquired information. The test of these two theories is difficult to devise because it is very difficult to design an experiment in which a subject is \"doing nothing,\" which would be necessary to test for the time decay theory. If the subject is not given a task to do, he might be rehearsing the material. Therefore, a perfect memory of the material could be explained by rehearsal or lack of interference. A poor memory also proves nothing, time decay or interference could explain it, particularly if another task is given. In experiments that have been designed to present a task that would involve different material and not interfere with retention, such as the task of detecting a weak signal in noise for a subject who had just heard a set of letters, the results indicate that both theories may be somewhat correct, but neither exclusively. Thirty seconds after the material is presented, the subjects retain it quite well, but after these thirty seconds, the information becomes very weak--the smallest amount of interference will destroy it. Therefore, it appears that rapid forgetting in short-term memory is due both to the passage of time and to interference from new information.

The five mental processes are encoding, retrieving, decision making, reasoning, and perceiving.\nD. The five mental processes are problem solving, decision making, perception, attention, and memory.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nPiaget described cognitive development as a sequence of operations through which a child progresses. American psychologists, however, prefer the component process theory of cognitive development. The theory is based on the assumption that a child's cognition develops as he reaches certain levels of competence in various cognitive skills. As the child gains cognitive abilities, they are integrated into a general cognitive ability. The component process theory is concerned with problem solving. The degree of success achieved is used as an index for measuring cognitive ability. Before a child is fully competent to solve problems, he must be capable of using five mental processes: encoding, memory, evaluation, deduction, and mediation. Encoding refers to the acknowledgment, understanding, and labeling of stimuli encoded as images. At this point in development, the child can imagine a particular object or sensation--he does not need to perceive it directly. When he acquires language, words are used in the encoding process. A child's success at problem solving is contingent on his ability to encode stimuli properly--he must be able to recognize it and know what it is called. The next step in the problem solving process is called memory. The child must be able to remember stimuli he has encoded and be able to draw on that information when it is needed to solve a problem. Language increases the child's memorization capacity to a large degree. Generally, it is the child's repetition of the words that describe a particular experience or stimuli that later enables him to remember the stimuli. Research indicates that the extensiveness of the child's vocabulary is an important factor in problem solving ability. The third mental process of problem solving is called evaluation. At this level the child sets up a hypothesis and weighs its advantages and disadvantages. The process of evaluation can begin at age 2. The next step in the problem solving process consists of the twin processes of deduction and hypothesis generation. Here, the child draws on hypotheses he has already made in order to arrive at a decision or make a deduction when confronted with a problem. For example, a child may know that both scissors and razor blades can be used to cut paper. If one of these instruments is not available, he will use the other. Hence, the hypothesis--both scissors and razor blades can cut paper--leads to the deduction: use one to cut paper; if it isn't available, use the other. The last of the problem solving mental processes is mediation. Mediation refers to the use of various tools or mediators to facilitate internalization of thought. Mediators include words, images, and concepts. The use of mediators is necessary in solving reversal-shift problems where the subject is asked to do the opposite of what he did in an earlier identical situation. For example, a child is presented with two containers filled to different levels with liquids of different colors. He is then asked to choose the container with the greater amount of liquid. To solve the problem he must disregard the color of the liquid. Once he learns to do this, he is asked to select the container with the least amount of liquid. If the child has good verbal mediation skills he will do this successfully. He can use words as mediators to tell himself which container has the least amount of liquid.

First of all, he claims that the amount of scatter (variance) or the discrepancy among the various subtest scores is higher for the psychopathological (psychopathological meaning being mentally disturbed) than fornormals. Wechsler also maintains that various score patterns, i.e., lower scores in performance than in verbal etc., can be associated with particular clinical syndromes such as schizophrenia, brain damage, anxiety states, and delinquency. Decades of research have failed to produce data that corroborates Wechsler's claims for his intelligence test. Wechsler failed to take into account several methodological requirements in making his claims. First of all, before Wechsler can claim that there is scatter among the subtest scores he must determine what the minimum statistically significant difference between subtest test scores would be. The reason for doing this is that the test scatter may be attributable to normal chance factors (error variance) rather than to specific individual differences (e.g., psychopathology). It may in fact be normal for subtest scores to differ by 10 - 15 points. Another point that Wechsler failed to consider was that statistical analysis shows that differences of 15 points or more between only two subtests will occur on the average of five times in every normal person's record (there are 55 possible inter-test differences). Therefore, unless a person has more than 5 or 6 large inter-test differences it is not possible to determine if he is psychopathological. Wechsler also failed to cross-validate his original findings. When Wechsler compared a pathological sample's test scores to a normal sample's test scores he did not recognize that the differences he found could easily have been attributable to sampling error.

Decades of research have failed to produce data that corroborates Wechsler's claims for his intelligence test. Wechsler failed to take into account several methodological requirements in making his claims. First of all, before Wechsler can claim that there is scatter among the subtest scores he must determine what the minimum statistically significant difference between subtest test scores would be.

Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions\nD. Heredity has no impact on emotional responsivity\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nResearch has indicated that emotionalresponsivitycan be inherited in animals. Significant differences can be seen in the degree of savageness between wild and domesticated animals. Wild animals such as gray rats, wolves, and lions are innately savage whereas their domesticated counterparts--white rats, dogs, and cats are innately tame. Even if these animals' environments are changed, they still retain their respective potentials for tameness and savageness. A wild animal raised by humans from birth will always remain potentially savage and will never become as tame as a domesticated animal. A domesticated animal released to the wild may become relativity savage, but will remain more \"tamable\" than animals whose ancestors were wild. Several experiments have been conducted to detect emotional inheritance. In one study, Hall (1938) tested the level of emotionality in 145 rats by using a device called an \"open field\"--a large compartment that usually elicits fear. Of these rats, Hall mated 7 of the most emotional females with the 7 most emotional males. Likewise, the 7 least emotional females were mated with the 7 least emotional males. This inbreeding continued for several generations. It was found that the offspring of the emotional rats were a great deal more emotional than the offspring of the unemotional rats. This difference was considerable, even in the first generation of offspring. In Hall's test of emotionalresponsivity, he found that the scores of the emotional offspring were seven times those of the unemotional offspring. The inheritance of emotions has also been studied in humans, although not as extensively as in animals because of practical and ethical considerations. In one experiment,Jostand Sontag (1944) studied children between 6 and 12 years of age over a period of 3 years. The researchers measured various bodily states which are known to at least partly reflect emotion. Among these were skin resistance, pulse and respiration rates, and salivation. For subjects, the researchers chose pairs of identical twins, pairs of siblings, and pairs of unrelated children. They wanted to see whether twins (who have identical heredity) are more similar in emotionalresponsitivity--as reflected in bodily states associated with it--than siblings and unrelated children. Using a correlation coefficient (a number between + 1.00 and - 1.00 used to express the degree of relationship between two sets of measurements arranged in pairs) the researchers combined the correlations of the scores on the different measures of bodily states. It was found that the correlations between identical twins were consistently higher than those for siblings, and the correlations for siblings were higher than those for unrelated children.

Disadvantages: may not accurately measure intelligence\nD. Advantages: provides a universal standard for intelligence. Disadvantages: may favor certain cultures over others\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nRecently, there has been much concern about the fairness of applying available intelligence tests to culturally disadvantaged groups. Culturally disadvantaged means that an individual is not assimilated into or knowledgeable about the culture he is living in. He often comes from another, different culture or is segregated from those cultural groups that dominate the society as a whole. It seems unfair to judge these individuals on the basis of their performances on tests that are inherently \"culturally biased.\" There appears to be no question that IQ tests, achievement tests, and aptitude tests are culturally biased. The mere fact that one needs to be fairly proficient in English language skills to do well on these tests is evidence of cultural bias.

Culturally disadvantaged means that an individual is not assimilated into or knowledgeable about the culture he is living in. He often comes from another, different culture or is segregated from those cultural groups that dominate the society as a whole. It seems unfair to judge these individuals on the basis of their performances on tests that are inherently \"culturally biased.\" There appears to be no question that IQ tests, achievement tests, and aptitude tests are culturally biased.

Four basic types of sensory receptors can be distinguished. First, there are receptors that relay information about stimuli that originate outside the body: these are theexteroceptors.Exteroceptorsare classified as distant when the source of stimulation is far removed from the receptor, as when you see a star. They are classified as contact exteroceptorswhen the source of stimulation is in actual physical contact with the receptor, an example being the taste buds in your mouth--you do not taste food until it makes actual contact with the receptors on the tongue. In direct contrast,interoceptorsare sensitive only to internal stimulation that originate within the body itself. They are usually located in the walls of internal organs. In the stomach, for example, they are sensitive to stomach distention (stretching). These receptors are hypothesized to play a role in satiety. Proprioceptors, located in muscles, tendons, and joints, are sensitive to movements of the muscles, tendons, or joints, such as flexion, when a limb is bent. These provide what we call our \"kinesthetic sense\" or sense of motion; they are of much importance in performing complex coordinated activities and in helping us maintain our balance. The fourth class of receptors is concerned with the vestibular senses--those of balance and orientation of the body and head in space. It includes the hair cells of the semicircular canals in the ears, which provide us with information regarding our head position.

These are environmental frustrations, personal frustrations, and conflict frustrations. Environmental frustration refers to frustration produced by environmental obstacles blocking the attainment of certain goals. These obstacles may be in the form of objects or people. For example, a flooded road may prevent a driver from reaching his destination and hence produce frustration. People, especially those in positions of authority, are also an important source of frustration, especially for children.

Learned goals are those which the individual comes to regard as important and desirable as a result of socialization. The individual normally adopts those goals which are shared by most people in his society. These may include high scholastic achievement or a good, high-paying job. An individual may wish to pursue various activities or goals but may refrain feeling he lacks the necessary ability. Frustration results when the person feels his goals or levels of aspiration are too high for his level of performance. Personal frustration is common in both children and adults. Motivational conflict--a conflict of motives--is the most important source of frustration. Conflict frustration commonly results from the individual's desire to engage in a particular activity, but because of societal attitudes or sanctions against that behavior, the person refrains. Hence, we have a conflict of motives. An individual, for example, might like to express his anger by striking the person he is angry at, but will experience conflict because he feels social disapproval will result if he vents his anger.

An individual, for example, might like to express his anger by striking the person he is angry at, but will experience conflict because he feels social disapproval will result if he vents his anger. Conflict frustration is the most deep-seated and persistent of the three types of frustration, and is usually the most important source of anxiety."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat have been the results of studies which investigated the tip-of-the-tongue(TOT) state?\n\nOptions:\nA.

It is here that the encoded information resides until it can combine with information coming from the next moment or until it can be transferred to long-term memory.

Primates can't learn sexual behavior through experience\nC.             Castration affects the ability to perform sexual acts in all animals\nD. Castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nIn simple behavior, animals respond to a particular stimulus in the environment with an appropriate response. However, few animals respond so automatically; stereotyped behavior can be modified. Sometimes the animal does not respond; sometimes it responds differently than expected. Its actions often depend on other controlling factors, such as hormone levels and previous experience. This question involves the use of these two factors in modifying sexual behavior. Hormones modify behavior by affecting the level of an animal's motivational state. They alter the animal's physiology, which can then alter behavioral patterns. For example, the breeding term in birds is initiated by physiological changes in the reproductive organs which produce the sex hormones. These sex hormones cause the development of special breeding plumage which subsequently affects reproductive behavior. The male hormones also induce courtship displays like bowing and cooing upon sight of the female. The female responds to these courting displays by the release of its own reproductive hormones which affect egg production. Eventually nest building occurs and copulation results. In each step of this reproductive behavior, hormones lead to behavior acts which cause further release of other hormones directing further behavior. However, as animals have evolved, there is less hormone-directed behavior, and more learned responses. Learning is the change in behavior as a result of experience. Only higher animals with larger and more complex brains demonstrate the process of learning. Learning affects man's behavior, very little of which is stereotyped. In man, hormones play a minor role in modifying behavior; learning plays a major role. When a mouse is castrated (testes removed), it can no longer produce any male reproductive hormones. As in the bird, these hormones are necessary for the reproductive behavior of the mouse. Removal of the hormones thus causes the sexual behavior of the mouse to decline and eventually disappear. The mouse apparently cannot learn its sexual behavior.

One example of such a characteristic is language. We may presume that the administrator of the test knows that the two cultures have different languages. Language differences are not of interest, the examiner is trying to measure some other variable (intelligence, perhaps). The examiner's concern, then, is that he wants to make sure that language does not affect his measure of intelligence. There are two ways to deal with the problem of language. The first way is to translate a given test into the language of the target population. Translated tests have two problems, however. First, the translation may not be equivalent to the original. Second, the translated tests should be standardized on a new sample of speakers of that language. The second way to deal with the problem of language is to completely eliminate language from the test. When educational backgrounds differ widely and perhaps some groups of examiners are inferior in reading skills it is best to eliminate reading and other verbal skills from the test. Different cultures often differ with regard to the value attached to speed of performance; in some cultures the tempo of daily life is slower and there is less concern with accomplishing tasks as quickly as possible. These cultural differences may be attributable to climate differences or perhaps to differences between urban and rural environments. Therefore, cross-cultural tests often try to eliminate the influence of speed by allowing long time limits and putting no premium on faster performance. The most important factor that cross-cultural tests differ on is test content. Certain tests may require that the examinee be familiar with the function of objects that are absent in his culture or which have different uses or values in his culture. Persons reared in certain cultures lack the experience to respond correctly to these items. Therefore, examiners who are interested in developing cross-cultural tests are careful about the nature of the test content. TheLeiterInternational Performance Scale is an individually administered performance scale which almost completely eliminates instructions, both spoken and pantomime. The examiner's comprehension of his task is considered as part of the test. TheLeiterscale consists of a response frame with an adjustable card holder. The examiner administers the test by sliding a particular card with printed pictures on it onto the response frame. The examinee is given a set of blocks with printed pictures on them and is supposed to choose the blocks with the proper response pictures and insert them into the correct frame. Among the tasks included in theLeiterscale are: matching identical colors, shades of gray, forms, or pictures; copying a block design; picture completion, number estimation, analogies, series completion, recognition of age differences, spatial relations, footprint recognition, similarities, memory for a series, and classification of animals according to habitat. TheLeiterScale has no time limit. The scale is scored in terms of the ratio of mental age (MA) over chronological age [(mental age) / (chronological age)] However, it should be noted that theLeiterScale IQ does not always correlate highly with the Stanford-Binetand the Wechsler IQ's; it is probable that theLeiterIQ is a measure of different intellectual characteristics. R. B.Cattelldeveloped the Culture Fair Intelligence Test, a paper-and-pencil test available in three levels each level having a varying number of subtests. The highest level consists of the following four subtests: series, classification, matrices, and conditions. For the series subtest, the examinee selects the item that completes the series. In classification, the examinee marks the item in each row that does not belong. The matrices subtest requires that the subject mark the item that completes the given matrix, or pattern. The subject's task in the conditions subtest is to insert a dot in one of the alternative designs so as to meet the same conditions indicated in the sample design. Unfortunately,Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test does not completely compensate for cultural disadvantages. In cultures different from the one in which the test was developed, performance was considerably below the original norms. Moreover, Black children of low socioeconomic level did no better on this test than on the Stanford-Binet. The \"Progressive Matrices\" were developed by Raven and were designed to measure Spearman's \"g\" factor, i.e., innate generalized intellectual ability. The test consists of 60 matrices (designs), of varying complexity, from which a part has been removed. The subject's task is to choose the missing insert from a set of eight alternatives. The matrices are grouped in five series. The earlier series require accuracy of discrimination; the later, more difficult series involve analogies, permutation and alternation of pattern, and other logical relations. The test is only moderately successful in predicting future academic achievement. Studies in a number of non-European cultures have shown that the test is probably not suitable for groups with very dissimilar backgrounds. In theGoodenoughDraw-a-Man Test the subject (the test is designed for use with children) is simply instructed to \"make a picture of a man; make the very best picture that you can.\" Emphasis is placed on the child's accuracy of observation and on the development of conceptual thinking, rather than on artistic skill.

That is, is there a relationship between a leader's style and his effectiveness in getting the group to perform the task at hand? Fiedler, in approaching this question developed a contingency model for leadership. The effectiveness of the leader depended, or was \"contingent,\" upon the interaction between the leader's style and three situational factors. His model was developed from his research activities involving managers and supervisors in a variety of organizational settings. Using a series of tests to obtain data on the values and attitudes and \"style\" of each manager, he obtained information in two basic areas: 1. Assumed similarity between opposites--This measurement determines the degree of similarity between a leader's rating of his most preferred coworker and his least preferred coworker. 2. Least preferred coworker--This score measures the degree to which managers are favorable in their ratings of least preferred coworkers. Someone who rates his least preferred coworker relatively favorably, and who does not differentiate significantly between his most preferred coworker and his least preferred coworker, is called a high-LPC leader. This leader tends to adopt a democratic person-oriented style. A person who rates his least preferred coworker very unfavorably, and who sees a wide differential between the characteristics of his most and least preferred coworker, is called a low-LPC leader and tends to adopt a task-oriented autocratic style. According to Fiedler, the leader who uses the human relations style is concerned about the feelings of others and derives satisfaction from a good relationship with his coworkers. The task-oriented individual, on the other hand, is concerned primarily with the task at hand and directs efforts toward productivity rather than personal relations. Fiedler makes the point that a leader's ability to influence the behavior of others is a function of selecting the appropriate style of leadership. The appropriate style may be different for different groups in different situations which brings us back to the three situational factors he believes will have the most significant impact in determining the appropriate style of leadership for any given situation: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power. When these three aspects were either very positive or very negative for the leader, a task- oriented, autocratic leader was most effective. When the situation was intermediate a democratic, person-oriented leader was more effective. This model has great logical appeal. For example, if group members know what they are supposed to do, like the leader, and the leader has a strong power position, there is no need to be person- oriented; it would be inefficient and a waste of time. Also, if group members did not know what they were to do, did not like the leader and the leader had a weak power position, it would still seem that a highly autocratic person would be the most efficient type in that situation. Attending to the personal needs of the group members would be a waste of time and interfere with the accomplishment of the task. A democratic leader will only prove to be effective in a situation that is moderate in the three aspects mentioned above, in which either leader power, task structuring or leader-member relations could be developed or strengthened. To start with the situation would need to be moderately favorable to the leader.

The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, modeling, and cognitive restructuring.\nD. The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive restructuring, and art therapy.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nBehavior therapy, also called behavior modification, is an attempt to studyand change abnormal behavior by drawing on the methods used by experimentalpsychologists in their study of normal behavior. Four differenttechniques of behavior therapy can be distinguished: 1)counterconditioning, 2) operant conditioning, 3) modeling and 4)cognitiverestructuring. Incounterconditioning, an undesired response to a given stimulus iseliminated by calling forth a new response in the presence of that stimulus. Suppose that a child hasnyctophobia-- fear of the dark. Whenever he finds himself in a dark place (stimulus), he experiences intensefeelings of anxiety (undesired response). The goal of counterconditioningwould be to elicit a new, positive response in the youngclient while he is confronted with darkness. This might be achieved byfeeding the child one of his favorite foods in the dark. In this fashion, thefear (undesired response) produced by darkness (stimulus) might be dispelledby the positive feelings (new response) associated with eating. Repeated associations of darkness with positive feelings would most likely curethe client of his phobia. Three frequently usedcounterconditioningtechniques are: a)systematicdesensitization b) assertive training, and c) aversive conditioning. Systematic desensitization, formulated by JosephWolpe, is a procedurein which a deeply relaxed person is asked to imagine a series ofanxiety-provoking situations, along a continuum. For example, a person whois afraid of taking tests will first be told to imagine the teacher telling theclass of an upcoming test; then he'll be told to think of himself studying forthe test and finally, he must imagine he is actually taking the test. This proceduremay require more intermediary steps, in which the person is toldto imagine more scenes before the final one, which is more anxiety producing. The number of additional steps depends on the level of anxiety. The relaxation serves to inhibit any anxiety that might otherwise beproduced by the imagined scenes. The imagined scene can be viewed asthe stimulus; the anxiety elicited by the scene is the undesired response, and relaxation is the new response. It has been found that the abilityto tolerate stressful imagery is generally followed by a reduction of anxietyin similar real-life situations. Assertive training is helpful to those people who are unable to expresspositive or negative feelings to others. For example, consider a manwho is often treated rudely by a business associate but is too timid to protestor express resentment. Because of his suppressed negative feelings, he experiences anxiety whenever he comes into contact with the businessassociate. Assertive training assumes that expression of positive ornegative feelings cancounterconditionthe anxiety associated with specificinterpersonal situations. Applying this assumption to our example, theanxiety (undesired response) elicited by the presence of the rude businessassociate (stimulus) would be counteracted if the timid man were toexpress his true feelings to the associate (new response). Another variant ofcounterconditioningis aversive conditioning, whichattempts to attach negative feelings to stimuli that are considered inappropriatelyattractive. Imagine that a foot fetishist wishes to be less attractedto the sight or feel of feet. To reduce the attraction, a therapist mightgive him repeated electric shocks as pictures of feet are presented. The goal of such therapy would be to make feet (stimulus) elicit anxiety (newresponse) rather than feelings of attraction (undesired response). Operant conditioning, also known as behavior shaping, is another techniqueof behavior therapy. The principles of operant conditioning are verystraightforward: behaviors whose frequency it is desirable to increaseare rewarded and behaviors whose frequency it is desirable to decreaseare either ignored or punished. Operant conditioning has been appliedto the populations of many mental institutions in the form of a tokeneconomy. Patients are systematically reinforced with plastic tokens thatcan later be exchanged for goods and privileges. The results of such programshave been very encouraging. Operant conditioning has also beensuccessful in the treatment of children with behavior problems. A third technique of behavior therapy is modeling, which involves learningby observing and imitating the behavior of others. As an example, examinehow modeling would be used to rid a client of a dog phobia. The therapistmight expose the client to both live and filmed displays of peopleinteracting fearlessly with dogs. Hopefully, the client would imitate themodels he has been exposed to and eventually overcome his fear of dogs. A number of research programs have shown that this kind of learningis helping people acquire new responses in a relatively short time. Cognitive restructuring, the fourth technique of behavior modification, attempts to directly manipulate the thinking and reasoning processesof the client. Perhaps the best example of a cognitive restructuringprocedure is rational-emotive therapy, which has developed fromthe work of Albert Ellis. Rational-emotive therapy assumes: 1) people cognitivelyinterpret what is happening around them; 2) sometimes these interpretationscan cause emotional turmoil; and 3) a therapist's attention shouldbe focused on these internal sentences and not on historical causes. An example of an internal belief which may lead to distress is the notionthat it is imperative to be thoroughly competent in everything one does. A person functioning with this idea in mind will view every error he makesas a catastrophe. A rational-emotive therapist would help such a clientby first making him aware of the irrational structure under which he isliving and then guiding him towards a belief in realistic goals.", "ref_id": 2105, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Describe the different techniques used in behavior therapy.", "options": ["The four different techniques of behavior therapy are psychoanalysis, cognitive therapy, humanistic therapy, and group therapy.", "The four different techniques of behavior therapy are systematic desensitization, assertive training, aversive conditioning, and cognitive restructuring.", "The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, modeling, and cognitive restructuring.", "The four different techniques of behavior therapy are counterconditioning, operant conditioning, cognitive restructuring, and art therapy."], "answer": "C", "solution": "Behavior therapy, also called behavior modification, is an attempt to studyand change abnormal behavior by drawing on the methods used by experimentalpsychologists in their study of normal behavior.

How is this function fulfilled?\n\nOptions:\nA. Dreams are a prediction of future events\nB. Dreams are a response to our physical body needs\nC.             Dreams are a reflection of our daily activities\nD. Freud claims the main function of dreams is wish fulfillment. This function is fulfilled through a hallucinatory state that structures events not as they would be in reality, but as the dreamer wishes them to be.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nTo Freud dreams represented attempts at wish fulfillment. He reasoned that the dream is a hallucinatory state that structures events not as they would be in reality, but as the dreamer wishes them to be. When unconscious desires conflict with conscious restraints, however, it is necessary for the \"dream work\" to pursue devious paths to express the wish. Dream Analysis An infantile dream, recalled many years later, points for Freud to the deep-seatedness and long-lastingness of psychosexual experiences in the infant years. A man, now thirty-five, relates a clearly remembered dream which he claims to have had when he was four years of age: The notary with whom his father's will was deposited-he had lost his father at the age of three- brought two large emperor pears, of which he was given one to eat. The other lay on the windowsill of the livingroom. He woke with the conviction of the reality of what he had dreamt, and obstinately asked his mother to give him the second pear; it was, he said, still lying on the windowsill. His mother laughed at this. Freud says: The dreamer's inability to associate justifies the attempt to interpret it by the substitution of symbols. The two pears...are the breasts of the mother who nursed him; the windowsill is a projection of the bosom. His sensation of reality after waking is justified, for his mother had actually suckled him for much longer than the customary term, and her breast was still available. The dream is to be translated: \"Mother, give me the breast again at which I once used to drink.\" The \"once\" is represented by the eating of one pear, the \"again\" by the desire for the other. Thus, Freud believed dreams to be an uncommonly rich source of unconscious material. He maintained that a skilled observer reviewing the contents of dreams could discover much useful information in the unconscious mind of the dreamer. Thus, Freud referred to dreams as \"the royal road to the unconscious.\" Because of the disguised nature of wish fulfillment in dreams, Freud distinguished between the manifest content of a dream, (the literal content of the dream as experienced by the dreamer) and the latent content, (the hidden, symbolic, actual meaning of the dream.) The mental processes that convert wishes and impulses into the disguised images of the manifest content are called the \"dream work.\" It is the function of the psychoanalyst to interpret or undo this dream work, to unravel the manifest content and reveal the more fundamental latent content from which the dream was derived. The study and interpretation of dream imagery was one of Freud's major contributions to the study of the unconscious. He believed that a \"censorship system\" existed at the border of the conscious mind that was very selective about the impulses it would allow the dreamer to recall to his conscious mind. Wishes that would be morally unacceptable to the awake dreamer would not be allowed to appear undisguised in a dream. This distortion by the censorship system made possible the fulfillment of hidden wishes without too much disturbance to the dreamer.

He reasoned that the dream is a hallucinatory state that structures events not as they would be in reality, but as the dreamer wishes them to be. When unconscious desires conflict with conscious restraints, however, it is necessary for the \"dream work\" to pursue devious paths to express the wish. Dream Analysis An infantile dream, recalled many years later, points for Freud to the deep-seatedness and long-lastingness of psychosexual experiences in the infant years. A man, now thirty-five, relates a clearly remembered dream which he claims to have had when he was four years of age: The notary with whom his father's will was deposited-he had lost his father at the age of three- brought two large emperor pears, of which he was given one to eat. The other lay on the windowsill of the livingroom. He woke with the conviction of the reality of what he had dreamt, and obstinately asked his mother to give him the second pear; it was, he said, still lying on the windowsill. His mother laughed at this. Freud says: The dreamer's inability to associate justifies the attempt to interpret it by the substitution of symbols. The two pears...are the breasts of the mother who nursed him; the windowsill is a projection of the bosom. His sensation of reality after waking is justified, for his mother had actually suckled him for much longer than the customary term, and her breast was still available. The dream is to be translated: \"Mother, give me the breast again at which I once used to drink.\" The \"once\" is represented by the eating of one pear, the \"again\" by the desire for the other. Thus, Freud believed dreams to be an uncommonly rich source of unconscious material. He maintained that a skilled observer reviewing the contents of dreams could discover much useful information in the unconscious mind of the dreamer. Thus, Freud referred to dreams as \"the royal road to the unconscious.\" Because of the disguised nature of wish fulfillment in dreams, Freud distinguished between the manifest content of a dream, (the literal content of the dream as experienced by the dreamer) and the latent content, (the hidden, symbolic, actual meaning of the dream.) The mental processes that convert wishes and impulses into the disguised images of the manifest content are called the \"dream work.\" It is the function of the psychoanalyst to interpret or undo this dream work, to unravel the manifest content and reveal the more fundamental latent content from which the dream was derived. The study and interpretation of dream imagery was one of Freud's major contributions to the study of the unconscious. He believed that a \"censorship system\" existed at the border of the conscious mind that was very selective about the impulses it would allow the dreamer to recall to his conscious mind. Wishes that would be morally unacceptable to the awake dreamer would not be allowed to appear undisguised in a dream. This distortion by the censorship system made possible the fulfillment of hidden wishes without too much disturbance to the dreamer. Thus, the only way that the unconscious could achieve satisfaction for its strong desires was by evading the censor by masquerading the unacceptability of its wishes behind the facade of neutral objects or ideas.

Attitudes and expectancy have no effect on attention.\nD. Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nBesides the external factors of intensity, size, duration and contrast, attentionis highly influenced by the internal state of the individual. Momentary preoccupations and long term interests are highly instrumental indetermining to what a person will attend in a given situation. If we happento be thinking of an idea or an object at the moment, it will attract ourattention even under conditions in which it would otherwise go by unnoticed. A person's mental attitude is also important in determining the focus ofattention. An attitude is a kind of limited orientation. It will make salient whatis relevant to it and tend to exclude other information. The effect of a mentalattitude or set of expectancies can be seen simply in the situation whereone has a question in mind concerning a particular object or event. The question or mental set will force the attention to focus on the aspects ofthe environment that will answer the question. If one wishes to know the timestrains depart for New Haven, it is likely that the focus of attention will beon the time-information board and not on the design of the stonework whichsurrounds the board. Like-wise, if one is curious about the nature of stoneworkframes, it is unlikely that train departure times will be noticed at all. Generally, we notice very little for which our mental attitude is unprepared. Though this would seem to limit our experience, it may be essentialas it involves a kind of mental economy.

Momentary preoccupations and long term interests are highly instrumental indetermining to what a person will attend in a given situation. If we happento be thinking of an idea or an object at the moment, it will attract ourattention even under conditions in which it would otherwise go by unnoticed. A person's mental attitude is also important in determining the focus ofattention. An attitude is a kind of limited orientation. It will make salient whatis relevant to it and tend to exclude other information. The effect of a mentalattitude or set of expectancies can be seen simply in the situation whereone has a question in mind concerning a particular object or event. The question or mental set will force the attention to focus on the aspects ofthe environment that will answer the question.

This experience of the futile, empty meaninglessness oflife -- a contemporary disorder--is sometimes called an existential neurosis, characterized by an alienation from society and self.Itskey componentsare the pervasive sense of meaninglessness, loneliness, boredom, apathy, and lack of direction.Franklcalled this collection of symptomsthe \"existential vacuum\" which he attributed in part to the declineof historical traditions and values, including religion. He believes thatthis decline in values has left people with an inner vacuum that has preventedthem from identifying values and a direction in life. The individual suffering from this modern neurosis lacks a sense of personalidentity and has a tendency to view himself as an automaton, goodfor nothing more than assuming a social role which some other automatoncould just as easily do. These people may even be quite good atperforming their roles in life, but they do so without real commitment, involvementor purpose.

Only mild punishment is effective in eliminating unwanted behavior\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nAlthough there is conflicting evidence, it is generally accepted that punishmentvery often is effective in the elimination of undesirable behavior. Several studies show that the intensity of the unpleasant stimuli is animportant factor. Stimuli which are only mildlyaversiveusually have no effect; moderately aversive stimuli serve to reduce the rate of responding; andextremely intense, harsh, punishment eliminates the behavior completelyand permanently.

This means that there is one universal, all- encompassing drive. According to Rogers, the one drive is the desire to \"actualize, maintain, and enhance the experiencing organism.\" The basic tendency is to grow and to expand oneself especially by welcoming new experiences. To actualize means to have a person's real self or essence emerge and to replace any false aspects of his personality. A person's real self includes latent desires and disguised proclivities. A homosexual is self-actualized when he recognizes and accepts his attraction to members of his own sex and acts to fulfill his homosexual inclinations. Obviously, there are often differences between one's self- image (heterosexuality, for example) and one's organismic experience (homosexuality, for example).

Methods include hypothesis testing, qualitative analysis, and correlation studies.\nD. The major methods of psychology are: the individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, and experimentation.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nPsychologists use several methods to study behavior. The method used depends on the type of behavior under investigation. The major methods of psychology are: the individual case study, naturalistic observation, tests, interviews and surveys, and experimentation. In the individual case study or the case history method, a single individual is examined intensively in order to examine a problem or issue relevant to that person. This method is often used in the assessment and correction of abnormal behavior patterns. In a case study, the psychologist often uses a number of procedures such as collecting biographical data on the individual, administering psychological tests, and conducting interviews with the subject. Sigmund Freud used the individual case study method of investigation. Naturalistic observation refers to the systematic observation of a certain event or phenomenon in the environment as it occurs naturally, without any intervention on the part of the investigator. The researcher avoids manipulation if he believes that it would adversely affect the basic characteristics of the particular phenomenon. If laboratory investigation interferes with the natural occurrence of the phenomenon, then the psychologist would prefer to witness it in its natural environment. For example, certain behavior patterns of monkeys such as mating behavior, might differ in a laboratory setting. Hence, the psychologist would try to observe this behavior as it occurs in the monkeys' natural habitat. Numerous psychological tests have been designed to assess certain aspects of behavior. These tests attempt to measure such factors as intelligence, anxiety, and leadership ability. All of these tests consist of a number of questions. When the test is graded, the person receives a composite score which should reflect his typical behavior in normal circumstances. As previously stated, the interview is used in conjunction with the case study method. Interviews may be structured or unstructured. Structured interviews, in which individuals are asked to respond to a number of pre-formulated questions, are most often given when the psychologist wants to collect information from a group of people. An unstructured interview is usually used in the intensive study of an individual. Here the direction of the interview is guided by the individual's responses and the examiner's hypotheses concerning the underlying rationale of these responses. Surveys are similar to psychological tests and interviews in that individuals are asked to reply to a series of questions or items. In a survey, however, the purpose is not to test or analyze a specific aspect of a person or group. The surveyor wishes to learn an opinion, attitude, or belief on a particular issue. Newspapers and public opinion polls conduct surveys to obtain the public consensus on a certain topic. In experimentation, the psychologist examines a specific phenomenon in a controlled laboratory environment. Here, he can rule out all extraneous and distracting variables and manipulate, with precise equipment and procedures, the conditions he wishes to examine. In experimentation, the researcher examines cause and effect relationships between a changing variable and a certain behavior. For example, if a psychologist wishes to examine the effect of early isolation on social development, he might place a monkey in isolation during the first few years of its life. The monkey would be placed in a controlled environment. The animal would receive everything necessary for physical survival, but it would not come into contact with other monkeys. After a certain number of years, the monkey would be placed in a cage with other monkeys who were not deprived as he was. The psychologist would then note the animal's reactions.

The patient may be depressed, or he may be manic, or he may exhibit bipolar symptoms--that is, he may alternate between the extremes of depression and mania. Symptoms of depression include loss of energy, loss of interest or pleasure in sexual activities, feelings of self-reproach, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Some manic symptoms are hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, loquacity (talkativeness), inflated self-esteem, and excessive involvement in activities without regard to their painful consequences (e.g., buying sprees, foolish business investments, sexual indiscretions, reckless driving). Another symptom of mania is \"flight of ideas,\" which refers to rapid shifts in conversation from one subject to another based on superficial associations. It can be seen, then, that patients with affective disorders may be classified as depressed, manic, or bipolar, depending on which kinds of mood-related symptoms they manifest. The secondnosologicaldimension along which affective disorders are subdivided has to do with the onset of the patient's disorder. This dimension is divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical affective disorders. The essential feature of episodic affective disorders is an episode of illness with a prominent and persistent disturbance in mood which is clearly distinguished from prior functioning. Here the onset of the disorder is relatively clear. As the previous discussion of the three divisions of the mood dimension may suggest, in DSM-III the episodic affective disorders are divided into episodic depressive disorders, episodic manic disorders, and episodic bipolar disorders. Affective disorders are classified as chronic when there is a long-standing (at least two years) illness with either sustained or intermittent disturbance in mood. Chronic disorders usually begin in early adult life without a clear onset or specific cause. Generally, the mood disturbances involved in chronic disorders are more prolonged but not so severe as those manifested in episodic disorders. Like the episodic affective disorders, the chronic affective disorders are grouped along the depressive, manic, and bipolar divisions of the mood dimension and are called, respectively, chronic depressive disorder (depressive personality) , chronichypomanicdisorder (hypomanic personality), andcyclothymicdisorder (cyclothymicpersonality). A chronic depressive disorder is characterized by a feeling of sadness. The depressed mood may be either persistent or intermittent and separated by periods of normal mood. These normal periods may last a few days to a few weeks; a diagnosis of chronic depressive affective disorder is not made if there has been a normal period of two months or more. The symptoms of chronichypomanicdisorder are similar to those mentioned in the description of mania. The disturbance in mood results in the patient being abnormally energetic and expansive. As in chronic depressive disorders, the mood disturbances in chronichypomanic disorders may be persistent, or intermittent with normal periods of mood lasting no longer than two months. The essential feature ofcyclothymicdisorder is a chronic disturbance involving numerous periods during which there are some symptoms characteristic of both the depressive and manic syndromes but not of sufficient severity to meet the criteria for a depressive or manic episode. The manifestations of the two syndromes may be separated by periods of normal mood lasting as long as several months. In some cases the two syndromes are intermixed, or they may alternate. The category of atypical disorders, which is subdivided into atypical depressive disorders, atypical manic disorders, and atypical bipolar disorders, is a residual category used for classifying individuals who do not fit into the episodic or chronic categories. An example of an atypical affective disorder is an illness which fulfills the criteria for a chronic depressive disorder, except that there have been intermittent periods of normal mood lasting more than two months.", "ref_id": 2145, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Discuss affective disorders as they are described in DSM-III.", "options": ["Affective disorders involve only feelings of extreme happiness or mania", "Affective disorders in DSM-III are only classified according to the predominant mood displayed by the patient", "Affective disorders are always chronic and long lasting", "Affective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms, and can be categorized into depressed, manic, or bipolar.

Lack of peer review\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nKinsey's research on American sexual customs during the 1940's and 1950's was critically received largely, perhaps, because of The controversial nature of the reports. The three major criticisms centered on: 1) problems in the interview, 2) sampling problems, and 3) generality of The data. There are four criticisms of the Kinsey's interview techniques. The first being that each interviewer was free to rephrase questions and probe at his own discretion. Because of such latitude in interview procedure, interviewers did not always produce comparable data. It appears that differences in the behavior of the interviewers produced significantly different answers from the respondents. A second concern was that all interviewers for both studies were male. It has often been found that the sex of the interviewer has an effect on what the respondent will be willing to report. For example, more sexual experiences are reported when the interviewer and respondent are of the same gender. A third criticism was that respondent's self reports may have been biased, for example towards attempting to appear normal and to avoid disapproval. The fourth concern was that some questions required that the respondent report retrospectively concerning their adolescence. As a result the reports may have been subject to the distortions that time and experience may impose on memory. The second major criticism of the reports concerned possible sampling deficiencies. Through lectures and public relations efforts, various groups were asked to participate in the study, but not every member of the groups came to these meetings. In the male sample of sixty-two groups it was found that members of forty-two of these groups had generally attended college. This suggests greater willingness among men who have attended college to participate in a study involving potential embarrassment. But the manner in which the data was reported precludes an assessment of the effects of this greater willingness to participate found among better educated groups. Another problem with the sampling was the intentional exclusion of nonwhites. Properly speaking, the reports refer to white Americans. The third criticism of the reports concerned thegeneralizabilityof the data. Kinsey made sweeping conclusions about men based on responses of less than two hundred individuals. Kinsey also made numerous highly complex interpretations and evaluations, some of them very prescriptive but often unsupported by the data. For example, of the 179 males who engaged in the least amount of sexual activity, Kinsey asserted that 52.5 percent of all American males were timid or inhibited individuals, afraid of their own self condemnation if they were to engage in any sort of sexual activity.", "ref_id": 2146, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What are some criticisms of the work of Kinsey ?", "options": ["Lack of funding", "Ethical concerns", "Problems in the interview, sampling problems, and generality of the data", "Lack of peer review"], "answer": "C", "solution": "Kinsey's research on American sexual customs during the 1940's and 1950's was critically received largely, perhaps, because of The controversial nature of the reports.

Four basic models of aggression reduction are punishment, punishment of aggressive models, reward of alternative behavior, and the presence of non-aggressive models.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are four basic models of aggression reduction which are commonly in use: punishment, punishment of aggressive models, reward of alternative behavior, and the presence of non-aggressive models. Punishment is probably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of how to reduce unwanted behavior.

Mild punishment is a far more effective tool for reducing aggression. The second model of aggression reduction is punishment of aggressive models. The underlying theory here is that a person who views another person getting punished for a certain behavior will be vicariously punished as well. (Possibly the idea behind public executions.) However, in small group experiments with children, observation of a model being punished for aggression did not lower the general level of aggression below that of a control group which did not observe such punishment. The third approach to the reduction of aggressive behavior is the rewarding of alternative behavior patterns.

Although best suited for children, this method sometimes works well with adults, and is based on the idea that the individual is behaving in an aggressive manner to attract attention. The research in this area is highly supportive of this approach. The main success of this method is that it clearly demonstrates that it is possible to train children to respond to frustration in non-aggressive ways. The fourth and final approach is the presence of non-aggressive models. This is almost a combination of methods 2 and 3 in that it combines the best of both. The supplying of knowledge to the extent that a certain behavior, if acted, would be considered inappropriate, is a powerful control of aggression.

Though it is assumed that crowding is bad, there is little hard evidence to prove that this is so. When crowding research began, it was conducted mainly on animals. In these experiments, rats, monkeys, rabbits, and fish all showed pathological behavior as a result of crowding. For example, the rats became hyper aggressive and antisocial, some even died of thirst even though there was a plentiful water supply. These experiments were taken to prove that crowding would produce the same type of bizarre effects in humans. However, the experimentation that has been done on the effects of crowding have yet to prove that this is true. An individual may live in a densely populated area or spend much of his day in a densely populated situation, and still not feel crowded. Density is a physical concept, while crowding is a psychological concept. Density of population does not necessarily lead a person to feel he or she does not have enough space. There is a correlation between density of population and antisocial behavior, but when other factors are controlled for the difference between densely populated and moderately populated areas disappears. The other factors that need to be controlled for are income level and ethnicity. Poor people and minorities tend to live in densely populated areas. When the amount of social pathology in poor ghetto blacks is compared with that of poor blacks in moderately populated areas, the differences are found to be equal despite the density of population. In fact, it has been discovered that delinquency is more correlated with income than density. Because human beings are remarkably adaptable, it may be that dense living conditions can be adapted to in such a way that they do not produce pathological behavior. It is true that in parts of Hong Kong residents have only thirty-five square feet per person and there does not appear to be any unusual degree of social disorder in that city.

When an individual takes a test, a spelling test for example, he receivesa raw score; in the case of a spelling test the raw score will probablybe the number of words spelled correctly. This raw score has no objectivevalue. Not only is it necessary to know how many words there areon the test (15 out of 30 words spelled correctly is better than 5 out of 30 words spelled correctly; i.e., percentages a more useful for test evaluationthan raw scores) in order to evaluate the raw score but it is also necessaryto know how everyone else in this individual's category or \"comparisongroup\" (age, grade, educational level, field of specialization, culturalbackground) has done.

It also raises the question of whata test score reveals about an individual; will the test score help the examinerto understand the examinee by providing meaningful informationabout his personality or intellectual characteristics? Construct validity is a complex and often elusive concept. It is difficultto understand fully what a psychological construct is. A psychologicalconstruct is a word or term that represents a set of consistentdata about a person. It is an inferred conception of a person. Psychological constructs help to organize a person's behavior into meaningfulcategories. Intelligence is a psychological construct. There is nobehavior which can be defined as intelligence. Intelligence is inferred; it isused to explain why some people do better than other people on specifictests. People often do not agree on what intelligence is because peopledo not agree on what tasks require intelligence. Like all psychologicalconstructs, intelligence has no tangible existence; it accountsfor a cluster of behaviors but is not itself a behavior. It is neither asystem nor a process. In essence a construct is a description of an assumedunderlying relationship among a group of hypothetically related behaviors. Thus an intelligence test does not really measure intelligence but measuresa person's ability to perform certain tasks which the examiner believesrequire intelligence (the underlying construct which describes howthe various tasks are related). In order to evaluate construct validity it isnecessary to determine what behaviors are theoretically consistent with theconstruct being measured. For instance, if a test was designed to measurethe strength of an individual's motivation to achieve (achievementmotivation) , the test results should be consistent with a theoryof achievement motivation. Thus, a person who scores high on achievementmotivation ought to do well in college (in relation to his scholasticaptitude). If he does not do well in college one of two things mustbe true. Either the test has poor construct validity and does not measureachievement motivation or the theory of achievement motivation isinaccurate; perhaps there is no such thing as \"achievement motivation.\" When an examiner wishes to assess the construct validity of a test he mustdo so in accordance with a theory of human behavior. The test score shouldbe able to predict behavior in accordance with a particular theory. Correlationalanalysis is the usual procedure for determining construct validity. The nature of the trait or construct indicates what other measures thetest should be related to. A newly developed group intelligence test shouldcorrelate highly with the old, individually administered, Stanford-Binet.The test should not only correlate positively with other testswhich are assumed to measure the same trait or construct, but ideallyit should also have no significant correlation with tests that do not measurethese traits. These two processes are referred to as convergent validationanddiscriminantvalidation, respectively. In accordance with a theory a test with construct validity should supportpredictions of group differences. College students should score higheron a test of achievement motivation than high-school dropouts (discriminantvalidity).

Often acute anxiety is considered a neurotic disorder in andof itself. Since anxiety is so important for the study of abnormal behavior thereis a definite need for a way of measuring it in individuals. Three techniquesare currently available: self-report, observation of overt behavior, and employing physiological indices. In the self-report technique, subjects may offer their own subjective impressionsof anxiety describing their experience in their own needs. Methodologically however, this does not allow for comparison between subjectssince the subjects give very different descriptions and may have verydifferent standards as to what they mean by \"anxious.\" To overcome thesedifficulties researchers developed self-report questionnaires to measureanxiety. The Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) is a commonly usedquestionnaire of this type. The statements are taken from the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI), a general personality inventorywith many dimensions. The items which comprise the MAS are thosestatements which correlate highly (negatively or positively) with an independentmeasure of anxiety. Overt behavioral measurement usually involves a trained clinician observinga particular individual's behavior to determine whether or not the individualappears to be anxious. This involves a commonsense, and thereforeunscientific, measure which is difficult to quantify. Examples of whatthe clinician might look for are nail-biting and trembling. Since anxietyinvolves a change in the individual's psychological state, the observermust know what the normal behavior of the individual is (theso-called \"base-rate\" of behavior). An individual who always bites his nailsis not considered to be anxious when he is observed biting his nails. In fact, the nail-biting might be soothing and the cessation of nail-biting mightin itself result in anxiety. Another example of overt behavioral measurementis the observation of a discrepancy between expected and actualperformance. If a student normally does \"A\" work in a class and getsa \"C\" on a test (assuming that the rest of the class does as expected) thenit could be inferred that the student was anxious at the time that he tookthe test. Excessive anxiety usually results in an impairment of performance . Finally, physiological changes are known to occur when a person is anxious. Examples of such physiological changes are increased pulse rate, rapid breathing, and sweating (this corresponds to the arousal of the sympatheticnervous system). Typically, the psychologist will have a base ratemeasurement for an individual's physiological functions. These measurementsare taken in an environment that does not induce anxiety. When a subject is then in an anxiety- inducing situation the meaningful changein the individual 's physiological functions is obtained by comparingthe new measures with the base rates. One of the most importantphysiological measures of anxiety is the galvanic skin response (GSR) which is the change in electric potential across the skin surface. The GSR changes with the increase or decrease in moisture on the skin. Thus palm sweating, a common indication of anxiety, results in an increasedGSR. The GSR is measured by a galvanometer (the famous, or infamouslie detector). Electrodes are taped onto the subject's skin; these electrodesmeasure electrical potential. The electrodes are connected to wireswhich are connected to a machine which records the GSR's on a movingroll of paper with a needle which moves up and down according to theintensity of the GSR. A large jump by the needle indicates a big changein the GSR; for people who are given a lie detector test, this is interpretedas a lie, or at least that they are unusually anxious about answeringthe question. Physiological methods used to measure anxiety do not assess anxietyper se. They actually are measuring certain definable correlates of anxiety. This is because anxiety itself is a psychological \"construct,\" i.e. an inferred, not observable, phenomenon. The measures of anxiety, consideredapart from a specific situation or context, may be meaningless. Rapid heartbeat, for instance, may be an indicator of sexual excitement, not anxiety.

Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant.

Though relatively simple to understand, its implications are widespread and complex.

In his scheme of personality development consisting of different stages, Freud stated that there is a certain amount of frustration and anxiety as the individual passes from one stage to the next. If the amount of frustration and anxiety becomes too great, that is, if there is too much anxiety about moving to the next stage, development may halt and the individual will become fixated at one stage. An overly dependent child is an example of someone who is fixated. Development has ceased at an early stage of development preventing him from becoming independent. In contrast, regression refers to a retreat to an earlier stage of development. Someone who encounters an intolerable experience and is unable to deal with it may engage in behavior appropriate to someone at an earlier stage of development. Often, regression is used as a means of handling frustration. A six-year-old who reverts to wetting his pants may be expressing his frustration from the loss of parental attention due to the birth of a new sibling. Similarly, a child who displays infantile behavior on his first day of school--crying, thumb sucking, etc. -- is regressing. Regression is usually determined by the earlier fixations of the individual. In other words, the person tends to regress to a stage upon which he has been previously fixated. For example, the child who becomes fixated at a certain stage which results in his overdependence, may become overdependent later in life when faced with an extremely unbearable or frustrating experience. In this case, he is regressing to a point of fixation. It is important to keep in mind that fixation and regression are relative conditions. An individual rarely fixates or regresses completely.

The five stages are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the unconscious phase.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nFreud divided the period of motivational development into five stages. These stages are characterized by the objects that are the goals of the individual during each particular stage. Freud believed that the primary driving force in an individual's life was the sexual urge. The stages are therefore especially concerned with representing changes of sexual gratification in relation to the child's body. The five stages in sequential order are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the genital phase. The oral phase begins at birth and lasts eight months. It is characterized by the infant's concern for his mouth and the gratification he seeks from oral stimuli. The most obvious oral activity the child derives pleasure from is eating. Oral stimulation, however, is also produced by engaging in such activities as sucking, biting, swallowing and manipulating various parts of the mouth. Freud contended that these activities are the child's means of fulfilling his sexual urges. Hence, Eros (the life instinct) makes its appearance. But Thanatos (the death instinct) is also seen since quite frequently children destroy objects they come in contact with, often by biting them. During this phase, the child's personality is controlled by the id. He demands immediate gratification of his wants. The next stage of motivational development is the anal phase when the child's central area of bodily concern is the rectum. Bowel movements become a source of pleasure to the child. He may defecate often to achieve this pleasure. This, however, would bring him into conflict with his parents. The conflict leads the child to develop an ego. He comes to realize that he cannot always do what he wants when he wants. He learns that there are certain times when it is appropriate to expel waste and other times when it is inappropriate. He gradually comes to understand his mother's wishes and abides by them. The child's central interest gradually shifts again--this time to the genital region. This stage is called the phallic phase and lasts from approximately two years of age to six. Sexual gratification becomes more erotic during this time as evidenced by the child's masturbation: actual manipulation of the genitals. It is during this stage that the phallus (male genital) acquires a special significance. Freud believed that the increased awareness in' the male of his sexual organs leads him to subconsciously desire his mother. In addition, the male child grows envious and resentful of his father and wishes to replace him as the object of his mother's love. This situation is called the Oedipus Complex. Similarly, a female undergoes a complex wherein she desires her father and rivals with her mother for her father's affections. This is called the Electra Complex. This complex involves penis envy on the part of the female child. She believes that she once had a penis but that it was removed. In order to compensate for its loss, Freud believed the girl wants to have a child by her father. Eventually, however, both the boy and the girl pass through these complexes. Once this happens, they begin to identify with the parent of their own sex. This marks the end of the phallic phase and the beginning of a new one. The next period, the period of latency, is characterized by indifference to sexually related matters. During this time, the child's identification with the parent of his own sex becomes stronger. The child imitates his or her behavior--speech, gestures, mannerisms, as well as beliefs and value systems. The child also incorporates more and more of the beliefs and values of his culture. Thus, the superego is developing to a greater extent. (It began to develop during the late anal and the phallic stages.) The child comes to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in his society. The period of latency is also marked by the fact that children seek associations (or playmates) of their own sex. Boys prefer the company of boys and consciously avoid girls. Girls prefer contact with other girls and avoid boys. This period of sexual latency lasts five years, from ages six to eleven. The final stage of motivational development is called the genital phase, which is the longest of the five stages. It lasts seven years from ages eleven to eighteen. This period is similar to the anal stage. There is a renewed interest and pleasure derived from excretory activity. In addition, masturbation takes place and is engaged in much more frequently at this time than during the anal stage. In the beginning of the genital phase, the person seeks associations with members of his own sex just as in the latency period. But the associations are stronger in the genital phase and Freud believed they are homosexual in nature, even though homosexual activity may not take place. As this period progresses, however, the homosexual tendencies are supplanted by heterosexual ones and toward the latter part of this phase, the child makes contact and forms relationships with members of the opposite sex. Also at this time, the superego undergoes further development and becomes more flexible. In the latency period the superego is quite rigid. The child adopts rules in the most literal sense. During the genital phase, the individual realizes that some rules are less vital than others. Consequently, his behavior will reflect this. He accepts some rules or norms and makes exceptions to others.", "ref_id": 2167, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "List and describe Freud's stages of motivational development.", "options": ["The five stages are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the conscious phase, a latency period and the genital phase.", "The five stages of Freud's motivational development are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the genital phase.", "The five stages are: the oral phase, the ego phase, the id phase, a latency period and the genital phase.", "The five stages are: the oral phase, the anal phase, the phallic phase, a latency period and the unconscious phase."], "answer": "B", "solution": "Freud divided the period of motivational development into five stages.

Dehydration, Overeating, Lack of sleep\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nOne complication that may arise during childbirth concerns the position in which the child is born. Normally, a neonate is born head first. Sometimes, however, the child may be born in what is called a breach presentation - when the bottom comes out first. Sometimes the neonate may come out feet first or the umbilical cord may come out alongside the head. The physician takes great care to make sure no complications affect the health and well-being of the child and mother. If a breach presentation occurs and the physician judges the width of the mother's pelvis to be too narrow for a safe birth, he may proceed with a Cesarean section. A Cesarean birth is one in which the child is born by means of a surgical incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus. A Cesarean section might be performed when the head of the fetus is considered too large to easily pass through the birth canal in the mother. In this case, surgical removal might be safer for both mother and child. The physician may use a surgical instrument called forceps to facilitate the delivery. This elongated, tong-like instrument is placed on the baby's head during delivery. The head can be rotated and pulled by the doctor. This procedure is used if the mother is so heavily sedated that she cannot do the pushing necessary for the birth of her child. Most physicians nowadays avoid the use of forceps because past use has resulted in damage to the newborn's head. When presented with a choice, most doctors favor Cesarean sections overforcepuse. For decades, pain-killing drugs have been administered to mothers during labor. So far, no study has indicated that these drugs produce harmful long-term effects on the child. However, some researchers have concluded that the behavior of children, whose mothers took medication during childbirth, is more sluggish during the first few weeks of life. Anoxia is another complication that may arise during childbirth. This, condition refers to a lack of oxygen supplied to the neonate. The condition can be caused by either a rupture of the blood vessels in the brain or by a malfunction in the umbilical cord which prevents it from supplying oxygen to the baby until he is able to breathe on his own. The elimination of umbilical circulation may occur as the result of a number of complications. For example, the cord may become clamped or pinched; oxygen flow may be delayed due to the forcefulness of the contractions, part of the placenta may become separated from the child and/or the mother; or excessive bleeding of the mother during labor may cause a decrease in the oxygen flow to the neonate through the umbilical cord. Anoxia can occur before birth if, for example, the mother is anemic. Because of an iron deficiency in the blood, the blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the fetus. The amount of oxygen in the blood of the fetus therefore is quite low and has an adverse effect on the child's development. Anoxia is responsible for brain cell damage. It has been cited to be the cause of some learning and behavioral difficulties. Cerebal palsy, in which there is arm and leg paralysis, finger and facial tremors, or an inability to use vocal muscles, has been traced to anoxia as its cause. Anoxia may result in the irritability of the neonate during the first week of life. It can cause tension in muscles and a decreased sensitivity to pain and visual stimulation. Studies concerned with the long-term effects of anoxia have found that children who suffered from the disease scored slightly lower on IQ tests than other children during mid-childhood.

The development of this quality is shared by all adolescents. The adolescent's speed of motor performance is greatly accelerated from middle childhood onward. The adolescent acquires keener senses and his reaction time is shorter. Participation in sports aids the development of physical strength and agility and improves reaction time. Athletic prowess plays an important role in peer relations, especially among boys. An adolescent boy's self-image and self-esteem are highly dependent upon his performance in athletic events since these bring him peer approval."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDefine emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.\n\nOptions:\nA. Emotion is a state of happiness.\nB. Emotion is a complex state characterized by heightened arousal level, defined in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation.\nC.             Emotion is a state of sadness.\nD. Emotion is a state of anger.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nEmotion can be broadly defined as a complex state of the organism, generally characterized by a heightened arousal level. The term emotion can be defined in three basic ways: in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Davitz(1969) found that for most people, the term emotion applies to a particular set of feelings. A person feels anger if someone is offensive to him, pleasure if he receives a gift, or fear if a fierce animal is about to attack him.Behavioristicpsychologists dislike defining emotion as feelings, since a feeling is a highly subjective state and cannot be measured objectively. As such, they are not likely to yield consistent data; and, in addition, they are difficult to organize. However, much recent work in organizing emotional feeling states has proved encouraging. Emotion may also be thought of as a response. \"Response\" in this case refers not only to an overt behavior, but also to an internal process that occurs as a result of a particular stimulus, either external or internal, which is significant to the individual. Emotion as a response has been viewed in two ways. First, some consider it a response to one's perception and judgment of a particular stimulus situation. For example, if a person perceives and judges a particular situation to be threatening, fear will be the emotional response. Other investigators supporting the (very early) position of William James see emotion as a response to physiological events that occur during a state of arousal. James suggested that emotions are responses to such bodily changes as increased heart rate and respiration. Emotion can also be viewed in terms of motivation. To some investigators, emotion is identical to motivation. There are two ways to look at emotion in this light. First, emotions are seen as strong motives; an organism is induced or motivated to do something in order to eliminate the motive. In the case of rats, for example, Neal Miller showed that rats learn new responses in order to remove themselves from an environment in which they had been shocked. The anxiety that motivated them to learn the avoidance response was viewed by Miller both as an emotion and a motive. Another view of emotion as motivation, proposed by Sylvan Tomkins, suggests that motives are important only when they are energized by emotional excitement or arousal. The motive specifies a goal associated with a particular physiological state, but this must be amplified by emotional excitement.

Anxiety thus signals the ego to actprior to overstimulation. Neurotic anxiety is the fear of the consequences of allowing a previouslypunished impulse to be expressed.

Ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory\nB. Questionnaires, focus groups, interviews\nC.             Recording therapy sessions, content analysis, rating scales, Q-technique\nD. Observational research, correlational study, experimental research\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nCarl Rogers was the first psychotherapist to suggest that researchersrecord therapy sessions. It was believed that the accumulationof a set of exact transcriptions would facilitate the intensive studynecessary to elucidate the nature of the therapist-client relationship, thechanges that occur in the client as therapy progresses, and the changesin the therapist's attitudes towards the client. According to Rogers, the source of emotional maladjustment is rootedin an unrealistic self-concept. Therefore, through the use of a researchmethod called \"content analysis\" he attempted to examine the qualitativechange in self-reference that occurred during the course of therapy. Rogers established categories into which a client's self-referencescould be placed. These categories included: positive or approvingself-reference, ambiguous self-reference, negative or disapprovingself-reference, and references to external objects. The researcherlistens to many taped sessions at various points in the therapeuticprocess and counts the number of references that are made in eachcategory at different times. It was found that during the course of therapythe client's self-references had changed from predominantly negativeto predominantly positive. This was only found in clients whose conditionhad been clinically judged to have improved. This result was inevitablebecause Rogers practically defined emotional maladjustment as self-disapproval. Therefore, improvement would have to be evidenced by moreself-approval. The method of content analysis can be used with any set of categories. For instance, the categories could be attitudes towards acceptingresponsibility. It can be seen that the method of content analysis isessentially an idiographic research technique, that is, it focuses on the individualcase and not on generating general principles of behavior. Rogers also originated the use of rating scales for the purpose of measuringprocess and change during therapy. One of the most interestingscales is the one which measures the therapist's attitudes towardsthe client. This scale\" has five stages.

It was believed that the accumulationof a set of exact transcriptions would facilitate the intensive studynecessary to elucidate the nature of the therapist-client relationship, thechanges that occur in the client as therapy progresses, and the changesin the therapist's attitudes towards the client. According to Rogers, the source of emotional maladjustment is rootedin an unrealistic self-concept. Therefore, through the use of a researchmethod called \"content analysis\" he attempted to examine the qualitativechange in self-reference that occurred during the course of therapy. Rogers established categories into which a client's self-referencescould be placed. These categories included: positive or approvingself-reference, ambiguous self-reference, negative or disapprovingself-reference, and references to external objects. The researcherlistens to many taped sessions at various points in the therapeuticprocess and counts the number of references that are made in eachcategory at different times. It was found that during the course of therapythe client's self-references had changed from predominantly negativeto predominantly positive. This was only found in clients whose conditionhad been clinically judged to have improved. This result was inevitablebecause Rogers practically defined emotional maladjustment as self-disapproval. Therefore, improvement would have to be evidenced by moreself-approval. The method of content analysis can be used with any set of categories. For instance, the categories could be attitudes towards acceptingresponsibility. It can be seen that the method of content analysis isessentially an idiographic research technique, that is, it focuses on the individualcase and not on generating general principles of behavior. Rogers also originated the use of rating scales for the purpose of measuringprocess and change during therapy. One of the most interestingscales is the one which measures the therapist's attitudes towardsthe client. This scale\" has five stages.

While most of us would like to have our own way as often as possible, we do not want to be manipulated by someone else if we can help it. In the early 1950's Richard Christie became interested in how and in what ways people differed in manipulative tendencies. The principles of Machiavelli, which are described inThe Prince, give advice on manipulating other people, and the term \"Machiavellian\" has come to be associated with the belief that the ends justify the means and that in order to maintain power one must manipulate people. It was these two tactics that interested Christie, and he sought to discover to what degree they were used by individuals in everyday life. With his associates, he developed a scale based on items drawn fromThe Prince, such as, \"It is wise to flatter important people,\" \"Most people don't know what is best for them,\" \"It is safer to be feared than to be loved.\" There has been much research using the scale and its subsequent refinements which points to a number of stable findings. Interestingly, scores on the \"Mach\" scales do not correlate with those on the F (Fascist) Scale which measures degree of authoritarianism, and therefore the two tests measure different tendencies. Christie proposed (and these positions have been mainly supported by the research)the following four characteristics of an effective manipulator: 1. The relative lack of emotion when dealing with people: Emotional attachments would interfere with manipulation attempts. 2. Lack of conventional morality: In situations in which attainment of power was most important, standard moral practices would need to be seen as an obstacle to the goal. Remember the manipulator holds to the philosophy that \"the ends justify the means.\" 3. No strong ideological commitments: For the same reasons as those stated above, any strong, emotional commitment would tend to reduce the effectiveness of the manipulative type in certain situations that might involve personally important issues. High Mach individuals do very well when asked to speak persuasively on an emotional issue they do not favor. 4. Relative psychological balance: Any gross psychopathology would impede the Machiavellian type from making rational judgments about others with whom he had to deal. That is, his own psychological needs might color his perceptions about those with whom he was interacting. There is some evidence supporting the idea that people who are involved in roles demanding a good deal of interpersonal contact tend toward higher scores than those who are in impersonal, more distant situations. For instance, in research on intended specialties among medical students, those naming psychiatry and pediatrics scored the highest on the Mach scale and those selecting surgery scored lowest.

Criterion-related validity measures the test's consistency\nD. Criterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predicting an individual's behavior in specified situations.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nCriterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predictingan individual's behavior in specified situations. This is done by comparingperformance on the test with an independent measure of validity, i.e., a criterion. If the test in question is, for example, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, then a suitable criterion would be future college grades. There are two types of criterion-related validity, concurrent and predictive. Predictive validity is related to tests employed for the prediction of futureoutcomes, e.g., \"Is Mrs. Brown likely to become neurotic?\" Predictive validity is most useful when applied to tests designed to select andclassify personnel: hiring job applicants, selecting students for admissionto college or professional school, or assigning military personnelto training programs. The concept of concurrent validity is concerned with tests employed fordiagnosis of an existing status, e.g., \"Is Mrs. Brown neurotic?\" Sometimes concurrent validity is used as a poor substitute for predictive validityin instances where there is no time to evaluate a future criterion. The usual purpose of a test with only concurrent validity is to provide a simplerand quicker substitute for the criterion data. It is important to rememberthat when a test has concurrent validity, the criterion, by definition, is available for use by the examiner. The examiner uses the test onlyif it is more efficient in decision-making than the criterion. The criteria themselves should have four qualities. These are: relevance, reliability, availability, and freedom from bias. A criterion is consideredto be relevant if the same factors determine success on it as determinesuccess on the test. School grades in mathematics are relevant criteriafor a mathematics aptitude test because success in a school subjectis determined by basically the same factors as success on an aptitudetest for that subject. The reliability of the criterion refers to its stabilityas a measure. A criterion would have no value if it was inconsistentin its ratings of one individual over a short period of time. The availability of the criterion is a practical but important consideration. It is most desirable if a criterion score can be derived with aminimum of difficulty, expense, and time. Freedom of bias means that thereshould be no \"criterion contamination.\" One of the serious problems encountered in assessing validity is criterioncontamination. Criterion contamination results when the criterion isno longer independent from the test results. This most often occurs whena supposedly objective rater is biased by test scores. (In this case the\"objective rating\" is considered the actual criterion measurement). For example, if an individual performs very poorly on a mathematics aptitude testand a teacher is aware of these results then the teacher's future rating ofthe individual's mathematical aptitude (the criterion) may be negatively affected. Under these or similar circumstances the teacher's rating, i.e., thecriterion with which the aptitude test is supposed to be validated, is contaminated. It is essential that the rater be absolutely ignorant of the originaltest scores when the purpose of the rating is to validate the test scores. The type of criterion an examiner selects usually depends on the natureof the test he is trying to validate. Basically, there are six types of criteriain common use. Intelligence tests are usually validated against someindex of academic achievement (school grades, achievement tests andteachers' ratings). One of the criticisms of intelligence tests is that sincethey are validated according to an index of academic achievement it cannotbe said with certainty that the test measures intelligence per se; thereis no obvious criterion that can be used to measure innate intelligence. Special aptitude tests are usually validated against one of two criteria. For example, in an Air Force pilot- selection test the criterion is performancein basic Flight training. Another criterion often used is the job performancerecord of the individual. However, this criterion would probablynot be used for an Air Force pilot- selection test because it is too dangerousto wait and see if an individual will be successful in combat (luckilythis can usually be determined in specialized training). Performance in specialized training is often preferred as a criterion to job performancebecause there is a greater uniformity of conditions possible duringtraining. An individual's job performance record may also be used asa criterion to validate intelligence and personality tests. Validation by the method of contrasted groups involves a criterion whichis based on the expected difference in performance of two groups. For an intelligence test it is expected that a group of institutionalized mentallyretarded children will have significantly lower scores than normal schoolchildren. An intelligence test that could not produce this pattern of resultswould be invalid. On a personality test designed to assess social skillsor traits the test performance of salesmen may be compared to the testperformance of engineers. It might be expected that salesmen would beparticularly socially adept because their job entails a great deal of socialinteraction. A personality test claiming to measure social adeptness mightbe considered invalid if it did not produce higher scores for salesmenthan engineers. The fifth criterion commonly used for validation (also for item selection) is psychiatric diagnosis. We might reasonably hope that a psychiatricdiagnosis based on prolonged observation and a detailed case historywould support the findings of a personality test. Unfortunately, oftenthis is not the case. It has been found that \"projective tests\" like the Rorschach Inkblot, the Thematic Apperception Test, and even \"empirical tests\" like the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI) which aredesigned to make diagnoses of individuals are often poor substitutes forprofessional psychiatric diagnoses. The sixth and last kind of criterion measure commonly used is a previouslyavailable test. This type of validation is usually used to validate ashorter, more easily administered test against a longer version. For example, a group administered multiple choice answer intelligence test maybe validated against the older and longer, individually administered Stanford-Binettest.If its results correlate highly with the Stanford-Binet thenit might be useful to use the new test in many situations. Criterion-related validity is often referred to as empirical validation becausea test's results are being compared with something empirical or objective. One of the major criticisms of projective tests, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, is that they are not empirically validated and thereforecannot be said to be assessing anything with certainty. It is essentialin all tests that claim to have predictive value to compare results withan empirical criterion; it is important to establish criterion-related validity.", "ref_id": 2182, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What is criterion related validity?", "options": ["Criterion-related validity is the testing of an individual's knowledge", "Criterion-related validity refers to the bias in a test's results", "Criterion-related validity measures the test's consistency", "Criterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predicting an individual's behavior in specified situations."], "answer": "D", "solution": "Criterion-related validity refers to the effectiveness of a test in predictingan individual's behavior in specified situations.

Freedom of bias means that thereshould be no \"criterion contamination.\" One of the serious problems encountered in assessing validity is criterioncontamination. Criterion contamination results when the criterion isno longer independent from the test results. This most often occurs whena supposedly objective rater is biased by test scores. (In this case the\"objective rating\" is considered the actual criterion measurement). For example, if an individual performs very poorly on a mathematics aptitude testand a teacher is aware of these results then the teacher's future rating ofthe individual's mathematical aptitude (the criterion) may be negatively affected. Under these or similar circumstances the teacher's rating, i.e., thecriterion with which the aptitude test is supposed to be validated, is contaminated. It is essential that the rater be absolutely ignorant of the originaltest scores when the purpose of the rating is to validate the test scores. The type of criterion an examiner selects usually depends on the natureof the test he is trying to validate. Basically, there are six types of criteriain common use. Intelligence tests are usually validated against someindex of academic achievement (school grades, achievement tests andteachers' ratings). One of the criticisms of intelligence tests is that sincethey are validated according to an index of academic achievement it cannotbe said with certainty that the test measures intelligence per se; thereis no obvious criterion that can be used to measure innate intelligence. Special aptitude tests are usually validated against one of two criteria. For example, in an Air Force pilot- selection test the criterion is performancein basic Flight training. Another criterion often used is the job performancerecord of the individual. However, this criterion would probablynot be used for an Air Force pilot- selection test because it is too dangerousto wait and see if an individual will be successful in combat (luckilythis can usually be determined in specialized training). Performance in specialized training is often preferred as a criterion to job performancebecause there is a greater uniformity of conditions possible duringtraining. An individual's job performance record may also be used asa criterion to validate intelligence and personality tests. Validation by the method of contrasted groups involves a criterion whichis based on the expected difference in performance of two groups. For an intelligence test it is expected that a group of institutionalized mentallyretarded children will have significantly lower scores than normal schoolchildren. An intelligence test that could not produce this pattern of resultswould be invalid. On a personality test designed to assess social skillsor traits the test performance of salesmen may be compared to the testperformance of engineers. It might be expected that salesmen would beparticularly socially adept because their job entails a great deal of socialinteraction. A personality test claiming to measure social adeptness mightbe considered invalid if it did not produce higher scores for salesmenthan engineers. The fifth criterion commonly used for validation (also for item selection) is psychiatric diagnosis. We might reasonably hope that a psychiatricdiagnosis based on prolonged observation and a detailed case historywould support the findings of a personality test. Unfortunately, oftenthis is not the case. It has been found that \"projective tests\" like the Rorschach Inkblot, the Thematic Apperception Test, and even \"empirical tests\" like the MinnesotaMultiphasicPersonality Inventory (MMPI) which aredesigned to make diagnoses of individuals are often poor substitutes forprofessional psychiatric diagnoses. The sixth and last kind of criterion measure commonly used is a previouslyavailable test. This type of validation is usually used to validate ashorter, more easily administered test against a longer version. For example, a group administered multiple choice answer intelligence test maybe validated against the older and longer, individually administered Stanford-Binettest.If its results correlate highly with the Stanford-Binet thenit might be useful to use the new test in many situations. Criterion-related validity is often referred to as empirical validation becausea test's results are being compared with something empirical or objective. One of the major criticisms of projective tests, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, is that they are not empirically validated and thereforecannot be said to be assessing anything with certainty. It is essentialin all tests that claim to have predictive value to compare results withan empirical criterion; it is important to establish criterion-related validity."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nFind the mode of the sample 14, 19, 16, 21, 18, 19, 24, 15, and19.\n\nOptions:\nA. 14\nB. 19\nC.             16\nD. 21\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe mode is another measure of central tendency.

Television has no effect on aggression\nB. Effects of television on aggression are unknown\nC.             Television reduces aggression\nD. Violent television increases aggression\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nToday's children spend more time in watching television than in any other activity except sleeping. It is estimated that over 75 percent of the dramatic shows seen on television contain violence. What is the effect of all of this violence on the children who watch it? There are essentially three viewpoints concerning the effects of violent television programming. The social learning theorists claim that television provides models for aggressive behavior and thereby reinforces already acquired aggressive acts and helps to instill new ones in the viewers. Because these models are on television they demonstrate that aggressive behavior is rewarded. Also viewing such activity tends to increase the arousal level of the viewers and thus the likelihood of being provoked into aggressive behavior. Another group of theorists believe that the watching of violence on television has a cathartic effect--through watching violent individuals on television, the aggressive energy that builds up in every human is released vicariously. It reduces the aggressive energy level and thus reduces the possibility that aggressive action will occur.

It is estimated that over 75 percent of the dramatic shows seen on television contain violence. What is the effect of all of this violence on the children who watch it? There are essentially three viewpoints concerning the effects of violent television programming. The social learning theorists claim that television provides models for aggressive behavior and thereby reinforces already acquired aggressive acts and helps to instill new ones in the viewers. Because these models are on television they demonstrate that aggressive behavior is rewarded. Also viewing such activity tends to increase the arousal level of the viewers and thus the likelihood of being provoked into aggressive behavior. Another group of theorists believe that the watching of violence on television has a cathartic effect--through watching violent individuals on television, the aggressive energy that builds up in every human is released vicariously. It reduces the aggressive energy level and thus reduces the possibility that aggressive action will occur.

Thorndike's Law of Effect, whichstates that responses may be altered depending on the effects they producein the environment. At about the same time Thorndike was conductinghis experiments at Columbia University, Small introduced the mazeas a learning instrument for animals. The maze soon became standardequipment for operant conditioning experiments and has probablybeen used more than any other type of learning problem. The first systematic study of operant conditioning was made by B. F. Skinner in 1938.He developed an apparatus (now known as the \"Skinner box\" second only to the maze as standard equipment in learning experiments) which consisted of a small enclosure with a lever device and afood receptacle. A hungry rat was placed in thebox,and in time usually pressedthe lever by chance, and automatically received food (a reward). After some time, most of the rats learned to make this response (lever-pressing) as soon as they entered the box. This learning was termedoperant conditioning because the animal had to perform an operationto get a reward. Skinner later applied the techniques of OC to the development of teachingmachines. In recent years,Skinner' sattention has extended to philosophicalissues based on his operant conditioning theory, the result beingthe bookBeyond Freedom and Dignityin which he subscribes to the doctrineof determinism. From his laboratory experiments with rats he has cometo the belief that societies as well as individuals can be controlled.

Thorndike's Law of Effect, whichstates that responses may be altered depending on the effects they producein the environment. At about the same time Thorndike was conductinghis experiments at Columbia University, Small introduced the mazeas a learning instrument for animals. The maze soon became standardequipment for operant conditioning experiments and has probablybeen used more than any other type of learning problem. The first systematic study of operant conditioning was made by B. F. Skinner in 1938.He developed an apparatus (now known as the \"Skinner box\" second only to the maze as standard equipment in learning experiments) which consisted of a small enclosure with a lever device and afood receptacle. A hungry rat was placed in thebox,and in time usually pressedthe lever by chance, and automatically received food (a reward). After some time, most of the rats learned to make this response (lever-pressing) as soon as they entered the box. This learning was termedoperant conditioning because the animal had to perform an operationto get a reward. Skinner later applied the techniques of OC to the development of teachingmachines. In recent years,Skinner' sattention has extended to philosophicalissues based on his operant conditioning theory, the result beingthe bookBeyond Freedom and Dignityin which he subscribes to the doctrineof determinism. From his laboratory experiments with rats he has cometo the belief that societies as well as individuals can be controlled.

Labor is the act of conceiving a child\nD. Labor is the period of gestation\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nLabor occurs when the fetus, placenta, and other membranes, are separated from and expelled from the mother's body. Labor usually occurs approximately 280 days after the start of the woman's last menstrual period. In the first stage of labor, the cervix (opening to the uterus) enlarges to facilitate passage of the fetus down the birth canal. Contractions occur which exert a downward pressure on the fetus and cause the cervix to widen further. At first the contractions are low in intensity and are spaced far apart, but gradually they increase in intensity and occur closer together. The actual process of birth is possible once the cervix is sufficiently dilated. In a normal delivery, the baby's head will appear at the opening of the cervix and continue to pass through it until the entire body has been expelled. This stage of labor usually takes about one hour. The third stage of labor is called the afterbirth.
