We are also given thermsvoltage, so we see a way to find thermscurrent, \\vertI\\vert = {(\\vertV\\vert \\vertI\\vert) / (\\vertV\\vert)} = {(4600) / (230)} = 20 amperes.(6) With this additional information it is now possible to solve for the magnitude of the impedance, by Ohm's law, \\vertZ\\vert {\\vertV\\vert / \\vertI\\vert} = {230 / 20} = 11.5\\Omega(7) Since Equation (1) was merely multiplied by a constant magnitude \\vertl\\vert^2 to obtain Equation (2), it follows that the angle of the complex power is identical to the angle on the impedance, hence, Z^\\ding{217} = \\vertZ\\vert \\angle\\texttheta= 11.5 \\angle30\\textdegree= 9.95 + j5.75 \\Omega.(8) (b) The solution to this problem is similar to that of part (a) except that the current is given and the voltage is to be found, so \\vertV\\vert = {(\\vertV\\vert \\vertI\\vert) / (\\vertI\\vert)} = {(5000) / (12.5)} = 400 V(9) and therefore, \\vertZ\\vert = (\\vertV\\vert / \\vertI\\vert) = {(400) / (12.5)} = 32.0 \\Omega.(10) Now, supplying the angle from the complex power, Z^\\ding{217} = \\vertZ\\vert\\angle\\texttheta= 32.0\\angle45\\textdegree= 22.6 + j22.6 \\Omega.(11) (c) The approach to this problem differs because both \\vertV\\vert and \\vertI\\vert are known but the angle is not given. If we search our stock of equations, number (4) appears to be help-ful because it includes \\vertV\\vert and \\vertI\\vert and the angle. We can see by referring to Equation (3) that thevarscomponent is known, and therefore, by inspection, \\vertV\\vert \\vertI\\vert sin \\texttheta = - 1500vars(12) from which we can solve for \\texttheta, since sin \\texttheta = [(-1500) / (230 \u00d7 10)] = - 0.652(13) which leads us to \\texttheta = sin^-1(- 0.652) = - 40.7\\textdegree.(14) Now this information can be used to find the complex impe-dance, since Z^\\ding{217} = \\vertZ\\vert\\angle\\texttheta= [(\\vertV\\vert) / (\\vertI\\vert)]\\angle\\texttheta= (230 / 10)\\angle-40.7\\textdegree= 23\\angle-40.7\\textdegree\\Omega(15) which can be converted to the rectangular form, Z^\\ding{217} = 23\\angle-40.7\\textdegree= 17.4 - j15.0 \\Omega."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nThe x and y components of an elliptically polarized wave in air are E_x = 3 sin(\\omegat-\\betaz) volts/meter E_y = 6 sin (\\cyrchar\\cyromegat-\\betaz+ 75\\textdegree) volts/meter What is the power per unit area conveyed by the wave?\n\nOptions:\nA. 0.03 watt/meter^2\nB. 0.12 watt/meter^2\nC.             0.09 watt/meter^2\nD. 0.06 watt/meter^2\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe wave is traveling in the positive z direction.

Similarly, the heat transfer calculated using the average coefficient will be the heat transfer over the entire length, or the total heat transfer. This is equal to the sum of the heat transfer from both the laminar and turbulent boundary layer regions, or q_T = q_Lam + q_turb(1) Now, the length of the laminar boundary layer L_cr can be found, knowing the critical Reynolds number. Re_cr = [(UL_cr) / \u0475](2) If the Nusselt number is found over the laminar boundary layer region, then the coefficient of heat transfer of that region may be found, as Nu_Lam = [(h_LamL_cr) / k](3) Then the heat transfer of that region is easily determined. Proceeding to that end, first consider the plate as a whole. For mixed flow (where there are both laminar and turbulent regions) the Nusselt number is Nu_L = [0.037 Re_L^0.8 - 872]Pr^1/3 with the constraint 5 \u00d7 10^5 < Re_L < 10^7 As this is satisfied, Nu_L = [0.037(9.8 \u00d7 10^5)^0.8 - 872](0.701)^1/3 = 1265.97 Then the average heat transfer coefficient is h_av = [(Nu_Lk) / L] = [{(1265.97)(0.01995)} / 2] = 12.63 Btu/hr-ft^2-\\textdegreeF This is used for the calculation of the total heat transferred, or q_T = h_avA(T_s - T_\\infty) = 12.63(2)(1)(500 - 100) = 10,104 Btu/hr (a) The length of the laminar boundary layer is found from eq.(2). L_cr = [(Re_cr\u0475) / U] = [{(5 \u00d7 10^5)(1.1026)} / {(150)(3600)}] = 1.021 ft. Now, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is found as Nu_L = 0.664 Re_L^1/2 Pr^1/3 where the subscript L refers to the length of the laminar boundary layer. The condition 0.6 \\leq Pr \\leq 50 is satisfied. Then Nu_L = 0.664(5 \u00d7 10^5)^1/2(0.701)^1/3 = 417.09 Then the heat transfer coefficient in the laminar region is found using eq.(3). h_Lam= [(Nu_Lamk) / L_cr] = [{(417.09)(0.01995)} / (1.021)] = 8.15 Btu/hr-ft^2-\\textdegreeF.

Similarly, the heat transfer calculated using the average coefficient will be the heat transfer over the entire length, or the total heat transfer. This is equal to the sum of the heat transfer from both the laminar and turbulent boundary layer regions, or q_T = q_Lam + q_turb(1) Now, the length of the laminar boundary layer L_cr can be found, knowing the critical Reynolds number. Re_cr = [(UL_cr) / \u0475](2) If the Nusselt number is found over the laminar boundary layer region, then the coefficient of heat transfer of that region may be found, as Nu_Lam = [(h_LamL_cr) / k](3) Then the heat transfer of that region is easily determined. Proceeding to that end, first consider the plate as a whole.

L_cr = [(Re_cr\u0475) / U] = [{(5 \u00d7 10^5)(1.1026)} / {(150)(3600)}] = 1.021 ft. Now, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is found as Nu_L = 0.664 Re_L^1/2 Pr^1/3 where the subscript L refers to the length of the laminar boundary layer. The condition 0.6 \\leq Pr \\leq 50 is satisfied. Then Nu_L = 0.664(5 \u00d7 10^5)^1/2(0.701)^1/3 = 417.09 Then the heat transfer coefficient in the laminar region is found using eq.(3). h_Lam= [(Nu_Lamk) / L_cr] = [{(417.09)(0.01995)} / (1.021)] = 8.15 Btu/hr-ft^2-\\textdegreeF.
