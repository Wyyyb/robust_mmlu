It can be balanced by using the following rules: (1) Separate the net reaction into its two major components, the oxidation process (the loss of electrons) and the reduction process (the gain of electrons). For each of these reactions, balance the charges by adding H^+, if the reaction is occurring in an acidic medium, or OH^- in a basic medium. (2) Balance the oxygens by addition of H_2O. (3) Balance hydrogen atoms by addition of H. (4) Combine the two half reactions, so that all charges from electron transfer cancel out. These rules are applied in the following example. The net reaction is Cr_2O^2-_7+ I_2 \\rightarrow Cr^3+ + IO^-_3 The oxidation reaction is I^0_2 + 2lO^-_3+ 10e^- The I atom went from an oxidation number of O in I_2 to + 5 in IO^-_3 , because O always has a - 2 charge. You begin with I_2, therefore, 2 moles of IO^-_3 must be produced and 10 electrons are lost, 5 from each I atom. Recall, the next step is to balance the charges. The right side has a total of 12 negative charges. Add 12 H^+'s to obtain I_2 + 2lO^-_3+ 10e^- +12H^+ To balance the oxygen atoms, add 6H_2O to the left side, since there are 6 O's on the right, thus, I_2 + 6H_2O \\rightarrow2lO^-_3 + 10e^- + 12H^+. Hydrogens are already balanced. There are 12 on each side. Proceed to the reduction reaction: Cr_2O^2-_7+ 6e^- \\rightarrow 2Cr^3+ Cr began with an oxidation state of + 6 and went to + 3. since 2Cr^3+ are produced, and you began with Cr_2O^2-_7 , a total of 6 electrons are added to the left. Balancing charges: the left side has 8 negative charges and right side has 6 positive charges. If you add 14 H^+ to left, they balance. Both sides now have a net + 3 charge. The equation can now be written. Cr_2O^2-_7+ 6e^- + 14H^+ \\rightarrow 2Cr^3+. To balance oxygen atoms, add 7H_2O `s to right. You obtain Cr_2O^2-_7+ 6e^- + 14H^+ \\rightarrow 2Cr^3++ 7H_2O. The hydrogens are also balanced, 14 on each side. The oxidation reaction becomes I_2 + 6H_2O + 2lO^-_3 + 10e^- + 12H^+ The reduction reaction is Cr_2O^2-_7+ 6e^- + 14H^+ \\rightarrow 2Cr^3+ + 7H_2O. Combine these two in such a manner that the number of electrons used in the oxidation reaction is equal to the number used in the reduction. To do this, note that the oxidation reaction has 10e^- and the reduction 6e^-. Both are a multiple of 30.

The first step is to write out the equilibrium expression and equate it with the given value. For the general reaction , xA+yB\\rightarrowzC, K is defined[C]^2 / { [B]^y [A]^x } , where the brackets represent concentrations. For this reaction , K = [NOBr]^2/ { [NO]^2[Br_2 ] } = 100 . To find out how muchNOBris produced, you would have to know how many moles of NO and Br_2 were reacted. Once this is known, you can find the number of grams produced. You know that the equi-librium expression is based on concentration of reactants and prod-ucts. Concentration is expressed in moles per liter. This means that if the volume of theNOBrand its concentration is known, you can find moles, since concentration X volume (liters) = moles. Let us represent the concentration as (N / V) = (moles) / (Volume) . Thus, the equilibrium expression becomes K = [(N_NOBr/ V)^2] / [(N_NO / V)^2 (N_(Br)2 / V)]. Let x = moles ofNOBrformed. Then, x moles of NO and x/2molesof Br_2 are consumed, since the coefficients of the reaction show a 2:2:1 ratio amongNOBr:NO :Br_2 . The equilibrium expression becomes 100 = (N^2_NOBrV) / (N^2 _NO N_(Br)2 ) = {x^2 V} / { (2\\Elzbar x)^2 (1\\Elzbar .5x) } . If x moles ofNOBrform, and you started with 2 moles of NO, then, at equilibrium, you have left 2\\Elzbarx moles of NO . You started with only 1 mole of Br_2 and (1/2)x moles of itformNOBr; thus you have 1\\Elzbar.5x moles left. Therefore, you need to determine only the volume to find the quantity NOBrformed.

At standard temperature and pressure, one mole of CO_2 or any gas occupies 22.4 liters. (Recall that standard temperature and pressure is 760 mm Hg and 0\\textdegreeC.) Because the temperature and pressure has been altered, the volume will no longer be 22.4 liters for one mole of CO_2. According to the combined gas law, PV/T = constant. Thus at standard temperature and pressure, [{(760 mm Hg) (22.4 liters)}/(273\\textdegree)] = a constant. (You add 273\\textdegree to the Celsius temperature, since T must be in Kelvin.) At 100\\textdegreeC and 720 mm Hg, you have [{(720 mm Hg) V}/(373\\textdegree)] = a constant.

To determine the number of moles of H_2 O_2, you know that, when oxidized, 1 mole of H_2 O_2 yields 1 mole of O_2. Thus, if you know the number of moles of O_2 produced, you also know the moles of H_2 O_2 originally present. To find the number of moles of O_2, you must use the equation of state.

This is analogous to density = (mass / volume) which can be rearranged to volume = (mass / density) except that in the case of molar volume, mass is replaced by the molecular weight of the substance. Therefore,V_1 = [(100 g mol^-1) / (1.00 g ml^-1) = 100 ml mol^-1 The osmotic pressure, \\pi = (X_2RT /V_1) .

The gas expands because its pressure is greater than the external pressure. When the pressure of the gas falls to 1 atm, which is the pressure being applied ex-ternally, gas expansion will terminate. This allows for determination of the volume change using Boyle's Law. You want \u2206V (volume change) , since w = work = P\u2206V. Boyle's law states that PV = constant for ideal gas. Thus, P_1V_1 = P_2 V_2. Originally, P_1 = 10 atm with V_1 = 1 liter. You end up with P_2 = 1 atm. Thus, V_2 = (P_1 V_1) / P_2 = [{(10 atm) (1 liter)} / {1 atm }] = 10 llters. \u2206V = 10 liters (final) - 1 liter (original) = 9 liters. Therefore, w = P\u2206V = (1 atm)(9 liters) = 9 liters-atm. But, there are 24.217 cal per liter-atm, so that, in calories, w = 9 liter-atm \u00d7 24.217 cal/liter-atm = 218 cal. q = the heat absorbed by the system. To find its value, you employ the first law of thermodynamics, which says \u2206E = q - w, where \u2206E = change in energy of system and w = work performed. Since the gas is ideal, E = energy is only a function of temperature. As such, \u2206E = 0, since the temperature is constant. You have, therefore 0 = q - w or q = w. But, you just found w, which means q = 218 cal. To find \u2206H, the enthalpy change, remember that \u2206H = \u2206E + \u2206(PV). You know that \u2206E = 0. To find \u2206(PV) , re-call that \u2206(PV) = P_2 V_2 - P_1 V_1, as derived from Boyle's law. However, P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 thus; P_2 V_2 - P_1 V1= 0. This means \u2206H = 0. In a vacuum, there is no external pressure. This means that no work can be done, so that w = 0. This is derived from the fact that work is defined as performing an action against a surrounding environment. If there is no environment, there cannot be any work. Since \u2206E remains 0 and q = \u2206E + w, then q = 0. Since there is zero pressure, PV = 0. Since \u2206 (PV) = 0, \u2206E = 0 and \u2206H = \u2206E + \u2206(PV), then \u2206H = 0.

When balancing it, you can use the following rules. Separate the net reaction into its two major components, the oxidation reaction (the loss of electrons) and the reduction reaction (the gain of electrons). For each half- reaction, balance the charges with H^+, if the medium is acidic, or OH^-, if the medium is basic. Next, balance the oxygens by the addition of H_2O. Balance total atoms by the addition of H atoms. Finally, combine the two half reactions, so that all charges from electron transfer cancel out.

Once this is known, subtract it from the initial con-centration. The difference yields the amount that reacted to produce NH_3 . By multiplying the quotient of the difference divided by the original amount of H_2 by 100, you obtain the per cent. To find [H_2] at equilibrium, employ the equilibrium constant expression. It states that K, the equilibrium constant, is equal to the concentration ratio of the products to reactants, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the chemical reaction. For this re-action, then, K = 2.37 \u00d7 10-^3 = [NH_3]^2 / {[H_2 ]^3 [N_2] } . To find [H_2 ], proceed as follows. Let x = amount of N_2 that dis-sociates. The initial concentrations of all species are 1M, sincemolarity= moles/liter, and 1 mole of each is placed in a one-liter box. If the N_2 's initial concentration is one and x moles/liter dis-sociates, then, at equilibrium, there is (1\\Elzbar x)moles/liter left of N_2 . In other words, at equilibrium, [N_2 ] = 1\\Elzbar x. Now, from the chemical equation, it is seen that for every mole of N_2 that reacts, 3molesof H_2 are necessary. Thus, when x moles/liter of N_2 dissociate, 3x moles/Iiterof H_2 are required. The initial concentration is 1, so that, at equilibrium [H_2 ] = (1\\Elzbar 3x) moles/Iiter. Notice, also, that for every mole/liter of nitrogen that dissociates, 2(mole/liter) of ammonia is obtained. Substituting these values into the equilibrium constant expression, one obtains 2.37 \u00d7 10-^3 = [NH_3 ]^2 / { [N_2 ] [H_2 ]^3 } = (2x)^2 / { (1\\Elzbarx) (1\\Elzbar3x)^3 } . Solving for x, one obtains x = .0217 moles/liter of N_2 that dis-sociate. Thus, [H_2 ] = 1\\Elzbar 3x = .935 moles/liter at equilibrium. The initial concentration was 1 mole/liter. The difference is the amount that dissociated, i.e., the H_2 .

The initial concentrations of all species are 1M, sincemolarity= moles/liter, and 1 mole of each is placed in a one-liter box. If the N_2 's initial concentration is one and x moles/liter dis-sociates, then, at equilibrium, there is (1\\Elzbar x)moles/liter left of N_2 . In other words, at equilibrium, [N_2 ] = 1\\Elzbar x. Now, from the chemical equation, it is seen that for every mole of N_2 that reacts, 3molesof H_2 are necessary. Thus, when x moles/liter of N_2 dissociate, 3x moles/Iiterof H_2 are required. The initial concentration is 1, so that, at equilibrium [H_2 ] = (1\\Elzbar 3x) moles/Iiter. Notice, also, that for every mole/liter of nitrogen that dissociates, 2(mole/liter) of ammonia is obtained. Substituting these values into the equilibrium constant expression, one obtains 2.37 \u00d7 10-^3 = [NH_3 ]^2 / { [N_2 ] [H_2 ]^3 } = (2x)^2 / { (1\\Elzbarx) (1\\Elzbar3x)^3 } . Solving for x, one obtains x = .0217 moles/liter of N_2 that dis-sociate. Thus, [H_2 ] = 1\\Elzbar 3x = .935 moles/liter at equilibrium. The initial concentration was 1 mole/liter. The difference is the amount that dissociated, i.e., the H_2 . The difference = 1\\Elzbar .935 = .065, Thus, the percent that dissociated equals [(.065M) / (1M)] \u00d7 100 = 6.5% ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDetermine the equation of state for a certain hypothetical gas whose thermal coefficient of expansion, \\alpha = (1/V)[(\\partialV) / (\\partialT)]_P = k_1 [(C_P) / (C_V)]T[(C)P / (C)V]-1 and the coefficient of isothermal compressibility, \\beta = - (1/V)[(\\partialV) / (\\partialP)]_T = (k_2/P) In this problem, assume that C_P, C_V, k_1 and k_2 are constants.\n\nOptions:\nA.

If one lets x = [H^+], then [H_2O_2] = 9.79 - x, since, at equilibrium, the original amount of H_2O_2 must be decreased by the amount of H^+ (or O_2H^-) formed. The equation, H_2O_2 \\rightleftarrows H^+ + HO_2^- indicates that H^+ will be formed in equal mole amounts with HO_2^-. Thus, [HO_2^-] can equal x. Substituting these values into the expression: {[H^+] [HO_2^-]} / [H_2O_2] = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-12, (x \\bullet x) / (9.79 - x) = 1.0 \u00d7 10^-12. Solving for x, x = 3.13 \u00d7 10^-6 = [H^+].

A mole is defined as [{grams (mass)} / {molecular wt}]. Thus, number of moles of PCI_5 = 1g / (208.235g/mole ) = .0048 moles . Therefore, the initial concentration of PCI_5 = [(.0048moles) / (.5 liter)] = .0096 M . To find its concentration at equilibrium, use the equilibrium constant expression, which states that K, the equilibrium constant, is equal to the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the equation. Here, you have K = { [CI_2 ] [PCI_3 ] } / [PCI_5 ] . But, you are told K = 33.3. You can equate to obtain 33.3 = { [CI_2 ] [PCI_3 ] } / [PCI_5 ] . Let x = concentration of [CL_2 ] at equilibrium. If this is the case, then x = [PCI_3 ] also, since from the chemical equation it is shown that they are formed inequimolaramounts. If x moles/liter of each CL_2 and PCI_3form, and the only source is PCI_5 , then the [PCI_5 ] at equilibrium is the initial concentration minus x (moles / liter) = .0096\\Elzbar x . Substituting these values into the equilibrium constant expression, you obtain 33.3 = { (x)(x)} / (.0096\\Elzbar x) . Solving for x, using the quadratic equation, you obtain x = 9.597 \u00d7 10-^3= [PCI_3] = [CL_2] at equilibrium. [PCI_5 ] = .0096\\Elzbar .009597 = 3 \u00d7 10-^6 .

To make a recurrence unit, one H_2O per monomer is eliminated. Therefore effective m = 131 - 18 = 113. Rearranging equation (1) to solve forX_ngives X_n= [M_n_ / m] = [(20000) / (133)] = 176.99 = 177 Since PA= 1, equation (2) changes to the form X_n= [{(1 + 1) / r} / {(1 + 1) / (r - 2)}] = [{(1 + 1) / r} / {1 / (r - 1)}] or 177 = [{(1 + 1) / r } / {1 / (r - 1)}] 177 = [{(1 + 1) / r } / {1 / (r - 1)}] = [{(r + 1) / r} / {(1 - r ) / r}] = [{(r + 1) / r} / {(1 - r ) / r}] = [(1 + r) / (1 - r)] = [(1 + r) / (1 - r)] Therefore, 1 + r = 177 - 177r or 178r = 176 From whichr = [{F_A (0)} / {F_B (0)}] = (176 / 178) = 0.9887 b) The degree of polymerization is defined as X = (number of repeat units) (number of monomers/repeat unit). Therefore200 = X (2) or X = 100 By definition w_X= [{X_r(X - 1)/2(1 - r)^2} / (1 + r)](3) Inserting the values for r and X into equation (3) gives w_X= [{100(0.9887){(100 -1) / 2}(1 - 0.9887)^2} / (1 + 0.9887)] = [{100(0.9887)^49.5 (0.0113)^2} / (1.9887)] = [{100(0.5698)(0.0001276)} / (1.9887)] = 0.00366 ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nEstimate the zero-point entropy of NO.\n\nOptions:\nA. 1.98 cal mol^-1 K^-1\nB. 2.78 cal mol^-1 K^-1\nC.             1.38 cal mol^-1 K^-1\nD. 0.69 cal mol^-1 K^-1\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe solid state NO can exist in two orientations which have practically equal chances of existence.

HF is an acid, which means it donates pro-tons (H+). The only base present is H_2O. They react as shown in the following equation: HF + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + F^- . This is not the only source of H_3O^+ . Recall that water also can dissociate into ions. H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftarrowsH_3O^+ + OH^- . This means that in the consideration of the H_3O^+ concentration you must look at both sources. Because you are asked the concentrations, you must employ equilibrium constants,K_dissandK_w. Let x = the number of moles/liter of H_3O^+ from the reaction of HF with H_2O, then x is also equal to the number of moles/liter of F^- produced. They have the same mole ratio, as indicated by theequilibria. Since HF is the stronger acid, some of its protons ionize and then join with H_2O to form H_3O^+ . Thus, the concentration of HF is (0.1 - x). If you let y = moles/liter of OH^-, then y = moles/liter of H_3O^+ formed by the dissociation of water. These variables that represent the concentrations at equilibrium must satisfy the two equilibrium conditions: K_diss= {[H_3O^+] [F^-]} / [HF] = 6.7 \u00d7 10^-4 = {(x+y)(x)} / (0.1 - x) K_w= [H_3O^+] [OH^-] = 1 \u00d7 10^-14 = (x+y)(x) . For both conditions, the H_3O^+ concentration is represented by (x+y) since, at equilibrium, the concentration must be the sum from both sources of H_3O^+ production. Solve these equations simultaneously for x and y, you can avoid cumbersome calculations by noting which contribution is the dominant one. In this way, the other can be neglected to give a fairly good approximation. A general rule for determining which is dominant is to compare the dissociation constants.

Thus, to find pH, calculate the [H^+] in 0.15 M H_2SO_4. H_2SO_4 is an acid and dissociates into H^+ (= H_3O^+) ions. The general reaction for acid dissociation can be written as HA + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + A^-. H_2SO_4 undergoes this reaction, as H_2SO_4 + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + HSO_4^-. But note, HSO_4^- is also an acid, it still possesses a hydrogen that can dissociate. Thus, one also has HSO_4^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + SO_4^-. In other words, there exist two dissociation reactions. As given, the dissociation constant for the second reaction, K_2, measures the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants. It is from this expression that [H^+] can be determined. H_2SO_4 is a very strong acid in its first dissociation reaction. This means it is completely ionized; i.e. 100% of the H^+ comes off (the first H^+ only). Thus, if there are 0.15 M of H_2SO_4, then, there are also 0.15 = [H^+] for the first dissociation. [H^+] = [HSO_4^-], as can be seen from the first dissociation reaction and are formed inequimolaramounts. Also, [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 (initially). For the second ionization, one is given K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2, indicating dissociation is not complete. From the prior explanation of what K_2 indicates, one can write K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-]. Note: Water is not included since it is assumed to be a constant. From the first dissociation, it is known that [H_3O^+] = 0.15. If x moles/liter of H^+ is produced in the second dissociation, the total [H_3O^+] = 0.15 + x. [SO_4 =] = [H_3O^+] from the second dissociation, since here they are formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, [SO_4-] = x. If one started with [HSO_4^-] = 0.15M (from the first dissociation) and x moles/liter dissociate in the second, one has [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 - x left. Substituting these values, 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-] = {(0.15 + x) (x)} / (0.15 - x) Solving for x (using the quadratic formula), x = .011.

[H^+] = [HSO_4^-], as can be seen from the first dissociation reaction and are formed inequimolaramounts. Also, [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 (initially). For the second ionization, one is given K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2, indicating dissociation is not complete. From the prior explanation of what K_2 indicates, one can write K_2 = 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-]. Note: Water is not included since it is assumed to be a constant. From the first dissociation, it is known that [H_3O^+] = 0.15. If x moles/liter of H^+ is produced in the second dissociation, the total [H_3O^+] = 0.15 + x. [SO_4 =] = [H_3O^+] from the second dissociation, since here they are formed in equimolar amounts. Thus, [SO_4-] = x. If one started with [HSO_4^-] = 0.15M (from the first dissociation) and x moles/liter dissociate in the second, one has [HSO_4^-] = 0.15 - x left. Substituting these values, 1.26 \u00d7 10^-2 = {[H_3O^+] [SO_4-]} / [HSO_4^-] = {(0.15 + x) (x)} / (0.15 - x) Solving for x (using the quadratic formula), x = .011. Thus, [H^+] = 0.15 + 0.011 = 0.161. pH = - log [H^+], so that pH = - log [.161] = 0.79."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA gaseous mixture of 90 mole percent hydrogen and 10 mole percent deuterium at 25 \\textdegreeC and a total pressure of 1 atm effuses through a small pin hole of area 0.30 mm^2.

Thus, in solving this problem one should first determine the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 7.6 g, then using the ratio (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (number of moles of Cr_2 O_3)] One can find the number of moles of H_2 necessary to reduce 7.6 g of Cr_2 O_3. After finding the number of moles of H_2 needed, one can obtain the weight by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight of H_2. (1)Solving for the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 7.6 g. This is done by dividing 7.6 g by the molecular weight of Cr_2 O_3 (MW = 152). no. of moles = [(7.6 g) / (152 g/mole)] = .05 moles (2)determining the number of moles of H_2 necessary. The ratio (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 )] will be used. This ratio was made using thestoichiometriccoefficients of the equation for the reaction (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (.05moles)] no. of moles of H = [(.05ntoles\u00d7 3) / (1)] = .15 moles (3) Solving for the weight of H_2. (MW = 2.) The weight of a compound is found by multiplying the number of moles present by the molecular weight. weight of H_2 = .15 moles \u00d7 2 g/mole = .30 g. (b) From the equation for the reaction, it is seen that 3 moles of H_2 are needed to form 2 moles of Cr. This means that for every mole of Cr formed 3/2 this amount of H_2 is needed. Thus, 1.5 mole of H_2 is necessary to form one mole of Cr. (c)Using the equation for the reaction, one is told that for every mole of Cr_2 O_3 reduced 2 moles of Cr are formed. Thus, one must determine the number of moles in 1 ton of Cr_2 O_3; there will be twice as many moles of Cr formed. After one knows the number of moles of Cr formed, one can determine its weight by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight of Cr. (1)Determining the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 1 ton of the compound (1 ton = 2000 lbs). The number of moles is found by dividing the weight of the Cr_2 O_3 present by its molecular weight. Because the molecular weight is given in grams per mole, it must be converted to pounds per mole before using it to determine the number of moles present. There are 454 g in one pound, thus grams can be converted to pounds by multiplying the number of grams by the con-version factor 1 lb/454 g. (MW of Cr_2 O_3 = 152.) MW of Cr_2 O_3 in lbs = 152 g/mole \u00d7 1 lb/454 g = .33 lbs/mole. (2)determining the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 1 ton. The number of moles present can be found by dividing 1 ton (2000 lbs) by the molecular weight in pounds. number of moles = [(2000 lbs) / (.33 lbs/mole)] = 6060 moles Thus, there are twice this many moles of Cr produced, number of moles of Cr = 2 \u00d7 6060 moles = 12120 moles (3) finding the weight of Cr formed. One knows that 12,120 moles of Cr are produced. To find the weight of this quantity, the number of moles is multiplied by the molecular weight. To find the weight in pounds, one must first convert the molecular weight from grams to pounds. This is done by multiplying the molecular weight by the conversion factor lb/454 g. This is used because there are 454 g in 1 lb (MW of Cr = 52). MW of Cr in pounds = 52 g/mole \u00d7 1 lb/454 g = 0.11 lb/mole.

Thus, in solving this problem one should first determine the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 7.6 g, then using the ratio (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (number of moles of Cr_2 O_3)] One can find the number of moles of H_2 necessary to reduce 7.6 g of Cr_2 O_3. After finding the number of moles of H_2 needed, one can obtain the weight by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight of H_2. (1)Solving for the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 7.6 g. This is done by dividing 7.6 g by the molecular weight of Cr_2 O_3 (MW = 152). no. of moles = [(7.6 g) / (152 g/mole)] = .05 moles (2)determining the number of moles of H_2 necessary. The ratio (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 )] will be used. This ratio was made using thestoichiometriccoefficients of the equation for the reaction (3/1) = [(number of moles of H_2) / (.05moles)] no. of moles of H = [(.05ntoles\u00d7 3) / (1)] = .15 moles (3) Solving for the weight of H_2. (MW = 2.) The weight of a compound is found by multiplying the number of moles present by the molecular weight. weight of H_2 = .15 moles \u00d7 2 g/mole = .30 g. (b) From the equation for the reaction, it is seen that 3 moles of H_2 are needed to form 2 moles of Cr. This means that for every mole of Cr formed 3/2 this amount of H_2 is needed. Thus, 1.5 mole of H_2 is necessary to form one mole of Cr. (c)Using the equation for the reaction, one is told that for every mole of Cr_2 O_3 reduced 2 moles of Cr are formed. Thus, one must determine the number of moles in 1 ton of Cr_2 O_3; there will be twice as many moles of Cr formed. After one knows the number of moles of Cr formed, one can determine its weight by multiplying the number of moles by the molecular weight of Cr. (1)Determining the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 1 ton of the compound (1 ton = 2000 lbs). The number of moles is found by dividing the weight of the Cr_2 O_3 present by its molecular weight. Because the molecular weight is given in grams per mole, it must be converted to pounds per mole before using it to determine the number of moles present. There are 454 g in one pound, thus grams can be converted to pounds by multiplying the number of grams by the con-version factor 1 lb/454 g. (MW of Cr_2 O_3 = 152.) MW of Cr_2 O_3 in lbs = 152 g/mole \u00d7 1 lb/454 g = .33 lbs/mole. (2)determining the number of moles of Cr_2 O_3 in 1 ton. The number of moles present can be found by dividing 1 ton (2000 lbs) by the molecular weight in pounds. number of moles = [(2000 lbs) / (.33 lbs/mole)] = 6060 moles Thus, there are twice this many moles of Cr produced, number of moles of Cr = 2 \u00d7 6060 moles = 12120 moles (3) finding the weight of Cr formed. One knows that 12,120 moles of Cr are produced. To find the weight of this quantity, the number of moles is multiplied by the molecular weight. To find the weight in pounds, one must first convert the molecular weight from grams to pounds. This is done by multiplying the molecular weight by the conversion factor lb/454 g. This is used because there are 454 g in 1 lb (MW of Cr = 52). MW of Cr in pounds = 52 g/mole \u00d7 1 lb/454 g = 0.11 lb/mole. The weight of the Cr formed is now found by multiplying this molecular weight by the number of moles present. weight = 0.11 lb/mole \u00d7 12120 moles = 1333 lbs."}, "question": "task_1"}}]
