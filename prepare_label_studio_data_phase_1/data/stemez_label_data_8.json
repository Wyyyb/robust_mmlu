A bacterial cell is fixed to a microscope slide, and the slide is covered with the following solutions in the order listed: crystal violet, iodine solution, alcohol , andsafranin.

The cell walls of bacteria are composed ofpeptidoglycan. This layer is thick in gram-positive cells, but thin in gram-negative cells, However, the latter havelipopolysaccharidelayer surrounding the thin peptidoglycan layer. The difference in staining is due to the high lipid content (about 20%) of the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. (Lipids include fats, oils, steroids and certain other large organic molecules.)

Conifers are distinguished from flowering plants by their needle-like leaves, xylem consisting almost entirely of tracheids, and their reproductive structures (cones).\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe term gymnosperm means \"naked seeds\" and the term angiosperm means \"enclosed seeds.\" The gymnosperms and angiosperms are both seed-producing plants which differ in the degree of protective covering pro-vided to the seeds by the structures producing them. The seeds of angiosperms are formed inside a fruit, and the seed covering is developed from the wall of the ovule of the flower. The seeds of gymnosperms are borne in various ways, usually on cones, but they are never really enclosed as are angiosperm seeds. Although embedded in the cone, the seeds lie open to the outside on the cone scales, and are not contained within any modified protective tissue. Conifers are classified as members of the group gymnosperm, while flowering plants are classified as angiosperms. An easy way to distinguish conifers from flowering plants is to compare the gross anatomy of their leaves. Needle-like leaves having a heavily cutinized epidermis are peculiar to the conifers. Due to their small amount of surface area (as compared to the broad, flat leaves of angiosperms) and their waxy coat, these leaves enable the conifers to survive hot summers and cold winters and to withstand the mechanical abrasions of storms. Most angiosperms cannot. Both conifers and angiosperms utilize xylem for the transport of water. The two types of xylem cells through which water is conducted are tracheidsand vessel elements (see 9-16). If we cut open the trunk of a conifer, we will find that its xylem consists almost entirely oftracheidswith bordered pits. On the other hand, the xylem of many flowering plants are composed of bothtracheidsand vessel elements, although the vessel elements predominate. Conifers can also be distinguished from flowering plants by their reproductive structures. Whereas angiosperms produce flowers and fruits, conifers produce cones which are formed from spirally arranged scale-like leaves bearing either seeds or pollen on the inner surfaces. Seed-bearing cones are referred to as female or ovulate cones; pollen-bearing cones are called male or pollen cones. The method of fertilization differs in these two groups as well. The flower of the angiosperm has its pistil constructed in such a way that the germinating pollen tube must grow through both the stigma and the style in order to reach the egg. In the conifers, pollen lands on the surface of the ovule and its tube grows directly into the ovule. Moreover, there is the phenomenon of double fertilization in flowering plants, which gives rise to a diploid zygote and a triploid endosperm.

The number of red blood cells in the human body increase at high altitudes due to decreased oxygen levels which stimulate erythropoietin secretion, thereby increasing erythrocyte production.\nD. The body produces more red blood cells to compensate for the low temperature at high altitudes.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIt has been observed that the loss of red cells by hemorrhage decreases the ability of the blood to deliver sufficient oxygen, and increased erythrocyte production results. Also, partial destruction of the bone marrow (by x-ray, for example) destroys the sites of erythrocyte production and diminishes the availability of oxygen to the tissues. Increased red cell production by the remaining healthy marrow follows. It seems that the initiator or stimulus for increased erythrocyte production could be a lack of oxygen. This is indeed found to be true. At high altitudes, the partial pressure of oxygen is decreased, and thus less oxygen is delivered to the tissues. Any condition that causes a decrease in the amount of oxygen transported to the tissues causes an increased rate of erythrocyte production. Actually a decreased oxygen concentration in the bone marrow does not directly (by itself) expedite erythrocyte production. In response to decreased oxygen levels, the kidney, liver, and other tissues secrete erythropoietin, also callederythropoieticstimulating factor. This glycoprotein is transported via the blood to the bone marrow, where it stimulates erythrocyte production. When the number of red blood cells has increased to the point where the oxygen level in the tissues is again normal, erythropoietin secretion decreases and a normal amount of erythrocytes are again produced. This negative feedback mechanism prevents an overproduction of red cells, pre-venting the viscosity of the blood from increasing to a dangerous level. It is interesting to note that erythrocyte production and hemoglobin synthesis are not necessarily correlated. An iron deficiency decreases hemoglobin synthesis (since thehemepart of the hemoglobin molecule contains an iron atom). This low hemoglobin level leads to a reduc-tion of oxygen brought to the tissues. As was cited before, a reduced oxygen level causes increased red blood cell production.

Abnormal type of hemoglobin, Hemoglobin S\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nSickle-cell anemia is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin, termed hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin S differs from normal adult hemoglobin in that it contains a different amino acid in one of its polypeptide chains (valineinstead of glutamate in one of the \\beta chains). This alteration greatly reduces the solubility of de-oxygenated hemoglobin S. The amino acid substitution creates a site on the surface of the hemoglobin molecule, sometimes referred to as a \"sticky patch.\" Onlyde-oxyhemoglobinS has a complementary site to this sticky patch. Therefore, thedeoxyhemoglobin molecules bind to each other, forming long aggregates which precipitate and distort the normal shape of the erythrocyte. Besides elongating the cell to the familiar sickle or crescent shape, the precipitated hemoglobin also damages the cell membrane, making the cell fragile. Thesickledcells either become trapped in small blood vessels (because of their distorted shape), causing impaired circulation and tissue damage, or they readily lyse because of their fragility. Sometimes, a vicious cycle is initiated when sickled cells cause vascular blockage. The blockage of the vessels creates a region of tissues where the oxygen con-centration is low. This deficiency causes moreoxyhemo-globinS to change into thedeoxyform, which in turn causes moresicklingand further decreases the oxygen concentration. This cycle progresses quickly and the resul-ting anemia is usually severe, often resulting in shock and death. Sickle-cell anemia is genetically transmitted. Sickle-cell anemic are homozygous for an abnormal gene which codes for synthesis of the abnormal hemoglobin S. Heterozygous individuals, who have one normal and one substitute allele, carry the sickle-cell trait. They do not usually show the symptoms of the disease except under conditions of low oxygen such as occurs in high altitude. The incidence of malaria and the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in Africa are correlated. It has been discovered that individuals carrying the sickle-cell trait (heterozygotes) are protected against a lethal form of malaria. This protection acts as a strong selective pressure to maintain the high incidence of the sickle-cell gene in regions where the incidence of malaria is high.

Fungi are both beneficial and detrimental to man. Bene-ficial fungi are great importance commercially.Ascomycetes, or sac fungi, are used routinely in food production. Yeasts, members of this group, are utilized in liquor and bread man-ufacture. All alcohol production relies on the ability of yeasts to degrade glucose to ethanol and carbon dioxide, when they are grown in the absence of oxygen. Yeasts used in alco-hol production continue to grow until the ethanol concentration reaches about 13 percent. Wine, champagne, and beer are not concentrated any further. However, liquors such as whiskey or vodka are then distilled, so that the ethanol concentration reaches 40 to 50 percent. The different types of yeasts used in wine production are in part responsible for the distinctive flavors of different wines. Bread baking relies on CO_2 pro-duced by the yeasts which causes the dough to rise. Yeasts used in baking and in the brewing of beer are cultivated yeasts, and are carefully kept as pure strains to prevent contamination. Sac fungi of genusPenicilliumare used in cheese production. They are responsible for the unique flavor of cheeses such as Roquefort and Camembert. The medically important antibiotic penicillin is also produced by members of this genus. CertainAscomycetesare edible. These include the delicious morels and truffles. The club fungi, orBasidiomycetes, are of agricultural importance. Mushrooms are members of this group. About 200 species of mushrooms are edible while a small number are poi-sonous. The cultivated mushroom, Agaricus campestris, differs from its wild relatives, and is grown commercially. Fungi are often of agricultural significance in that they can seriously damage crops. Members of theOomycetes, also known as water molds, cause plant seedling diseases, downy mildew of grapes, and potato blight (this was the cause of the Irish potato famine). Mildew is a water mold that grows parasitically on damp, shaded areas. Rhizopusstolonifer, a member of theZygomycetes, is known as black bread mold. Once very common, it is now controlled by refrigeration and by additives that inhibit mold growth. TheAascomyceteClaviceps purpurea causes the disease ergot, which occurs in rye and other cereal plants and results in ergot poi-soning of humans and livestock. This type of poisoning may be fatal. The disease caused in humans is called St.Vitus's dance Visual hallucinations are a common symptom of this disease. Lysergic acid is a constituent of ergot and is an intermediate in the synthesis of LSD. The \"dance macabre\" of the Middle Ages is now believed to have been caused by ergot poisoning. Basidiomycetes are also responsible for agricultural dam-age. Certain club fungi are known as smuts and rusts. Smuts damage crops such as corn, and rusts damage cereal crops such as wheat. Bracket fungi, another type of club fungi, cause enormous economic losses by damaging wood of both living trees and stored lumber. Fungi are also important to man because of the diseases they cause in man and livestock.Candidaalbicanscauses a throat and mouth disease, \"thrush\", and also infects the mucous membranes of the lungs and genital organs.

The different types of yeasts used in wine production are in part responsible for the distinctive flavors of different wines. Bread baking relies on CO_2 pro-duced by the yeasts which causes the dough to rise. Yeasts used in baking and in the brewing of beer are cultivated yeasts, and are carefully kept as pure strains to prevent contamination. Sac fungi of genusPenicilliumare used in cheese production. They are responsible for the unique flavor of cheeses such as Roquefort and Camembert. The medically important antibiotic penicillin is also produced by members of this genus. CertainAscomycetesare edible. These include the delicious morels and truffles. The club fungi, orBasidiomycetes, are of agricultural importance. Mushrooms are members of this group. About 200 species of mushrooms are edible while a small number are poi-sonous. The cultivated mushroom, Agaricus campestris, differs from its wild relatives, and is grown commercially. Fungi are often of agricultural significance in that they can seriously damage crops. Members of theOomycetes, also known as water molds, cause plant seedling diseases, downy mildew of grapes, and potato blight (this was the cause of the Irish potato famine). Mildew is a water mold that grows parasitically on damp, shaded areas. Rhizopusstolonifer, a member of theZygomycetes, is known as black bread mold. Once very common, it is now controlled by refrigeration and by additives that inhibit mold growth. TheAascomyceteClaviceps purpurea causes the disease ergot, which occurs in rye and other cereal plants and results in ergot poi-soning of humans and livestock. This type of poisoning may be fatal. The disease caused in humans is called St.Vitus's dance Visual hallucinations are a common symptom of this disease. Lysergic acid is a constituent of ergot and is an intermediate in the synthesis of LSD. The \"dance macabre\" of the Middle Ages is now believed to have been caused by ergot poisoning. Basidiomycetes are also responsible for agricultural dam-age. Certain club fungi are known as smuts and rusts. Smuts damage crops such as corn, and rusts damage cereal crops such as wheat. Bracket fungi, another type of club fungi, cause enormous economic losses by damaging wood of both living trees and stored lumber. Fungi are also important to man because of the diseases they cause in man and livestock.Candidaalbicanscauses a throat and mouth disease, \"thrush\", and also infects the mucous membranes of the lungs and genital organs. Many skin diseases are caused by fungi, including ringworm and athlete's foot."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat are the major forces of evolution?\n\nOptions:\nA. reproduction, migration, mutation, natural selection\nB. mutation, genetic drift, migration, natural selection\nC.             mutation, genetic drift, movement, natural selection\nD. mutation, genetic shift, migration, natural selection\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nEvolution is the result of the interaction of four major forces. These are1) mutation, 2) genetic drift, 3) migration, and 4) natural selection. These four forces have one thing in common - each can bring about evolutionby changing the allele frequencies in the gene pool of a populationover time. Mutations are random events that occur at a very low rate of approximatelyone out of every 10^6 genes. If evolution depended on the occurrenceof mutations alone, life would not exist as we know it today. However, mutation is important because it introduces variety into a population. Natural selection can act upon these variations to increase the frequenciesof the few adaptive mutations and decrease the frequencies ofthe many more maladaptive ones over time. Genetic drift acts in the evolutionary process by causing chance fluctuationsin gene pool frequencies. Although this has essentially no effectin large popu-lations, it is probably the major cause of evolution in smallpopulations. In these populations, chance - including accidents, matingpreferences and other unpredictable events - can cause an allele's frequencyto fluctuate widely from one generation to the next. This can resultin either the fixation of that allele or its elimination from the gene pool. Genetic drift can also interact with the processes by which small populationsbecome established to produce major evolutionary changes. Two processes of population establishment are the 1) Founder Effect and 2)isolation. In the Founder Effect, a small group of individuals may leave alarge population and re-establish in another location. The main populationhas certain gene frequencies - for example, the frequency of geneA may be .6, and that of gene a may be .4. It is very possible that the smallgroup will, entirely by chance, have allele frequencies different than thoseof the main population - perhaps A = .2 and a = .8. Thus, the new populationbeing founded will begin with a different assortment and proportionof alleles than the parent population. If the new population survivesgenetic drift over time may result in its becoming drasti-cally differentfrom the original population. This has been shown to be especiallytrue on small isolated islands that have been settled by a few animals. These same principles may be applied to small, naturally occurringpopulations that have been isolated by events in nature. For example, after a severe dry season, marine organisms formerly inhabiting onelarge lake may become isolated from one another as the lake dries up intomany small pools. This could result in a variety of small populations havingvarying allele frequencies and gene pool composition. Migration occurs when individuals from one breeding population leaveto join another. Migration can be either inward (immigration) or outward(emigration). The effect of migration on allele frequency in a populationis a function of the size of that population in relation to the size ofthe migration. In a small population, the frequency of many genes can besignificantly altered by a small migration, while large populations can usuallyabsorb large amounts of migration before a noticeable change in frequenciesoccurs. Migration may lead to either more variation in a population, due to the introduction of new genes through immigration, or lessvariation due to the loss of genes through emigration. Natural selection ensures that the changes in allele frequency causedby mutation, migration, and genetic drift are adaptive. As such, evolutionwill more likely give rise to a species better adapted to live in its environment. Although the previously discussed forces are non-directional , natural selection is a directional process through which populationsadapt to their parti-cular environments by changing their allele frequenciesin response to environmental or selection pressure. More specifically, natural selection operates through dif-ferential reproduction, whichis said to have occurred when certain individuals are able, by survivingand/or reproducing at a higher rate, to preferentially propagate andtransmit their respective genes over those of other individuals.

Other wastes such as oxalic acid accumulate in the cells of the leaves and are eliminated from the plant when the leaves are shed."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nThe principle of negative feedback, where an increase in the output of a system acts on the system to halt its further production, is manifested in the menstrual cycle.

The negative feedback mechanism is manifested in the menstrual cycle between estrogen and progesterone.\nD. The negative feedback mechanism is manifested in the menstrual cycle between LH and FSH.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe first event in a menstrual cycle following the menstrual phase (flow phase) is an increase in the secretion of FSH by the anterior pituitary as a result of stimulation by the hypothalamus. This hormone stimulates the development of the follicles in the ovaries, which contain the eggs. After some time, one of the follicle gains predominance. At this point, only this one follicle continues to grow. Under the combined influence of both FSH and LH, the latter of which is maintained, at a low level in the blood by the follicular cells, the cells surrounding the egg within the follicle begin to secrete estrogen. As more and more estrogen is produced, the increased level of this hormone in the blood exerts an inhibitory effect on the FSH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus. This results in a decrease in the level of FSH produced by the anterior pituitary. This is the negative feedback mechanism between estrogen and FSH. High concentration of a secreted substance (estrogen) turns off the original stimulus for its production (FSH), so that an excessive amount of the secreted substance (estrogen) would not be made. This occurs roughly 8 to 10 days following the menstrual phase, or 13 to 15 days after the start of the cycle. While the high level of estrogen inhibits FSH production, it activates the LH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus, ultimately inducing a surge of LH into the circulatory system, which initiates ovulation. After ovulation the ovarian follicle with the egg discharged develops into the progesterone-secreting corpus luteum. The corpus luteum promotes the plasma progesterone level to such a state that progesterone begins to exert ah inhibitory effect on the LH-stimulating center in the hypothalamus.

Bryophytes have adaptations such as a strong root system and the ability to produce flowers\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe bryophytes are considered one of the early invaders of the land. In order to survive on land, a plant must have certain structures which will enable it to exploit a terrestrial environment for food, water, gases and to afford it protection against environ-mental hazards. Although the bryophytes are far from being truly terrestrial and retain a strong dependency on a moist surrounding, they have accumulated important adaptations enabling them to live successfully on land. Because land plants are removed from a water environment, they face the potential danger of dehydration due to evaporation. To reduce water loss, most bryophytes have an epidermis. In the mosses, it is thickened and waxy, forming a cuticle. Unlike aquatic plants, which obtain and excrete gases dissolved in water, land plants require an efficient means to exchange gases with the atmosphere. The epidermis of the bryophytes is provided with numerous pores for the diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen. Diffusion through pores is a much faster and more efficient process for gaseous exchange than simple diffusion through membranes. Besides gases, land plants need to obtain water, which may be a limiting factor in a terrestrial environ-ment. Most bryophytes absorb water and minerals directly and rapidly through their leaves and plant axis, which may have a central strand of thin-walled conducting cells. Generally, the plant is attached to the substrate by means of elongated single cells or filaments of cells called rhizoids.

In most bryophytes, however, the rhizoids are not true roots and serve only in anchoring the plant. In addition to structures, the bryophytes have evolved a life cycle in which the developing zygote is protected within the female gametophyte.

In order to survive on land, a plant must have certain structures which will enable it to exploit a terrestrial environment for food, water, gases and to afford it protection against environ-mental hazards. Although the bryophytes are far from being truly terrestrial and retain a strong dependency on a moist surrounding, they have accumulated important adaptations enabling them to live successfully on land. Because land plants are removed from a water environment, they face the potential danger of dehydration due to evaporation. To reduce water loss, most bryophytes have an epidermis. In the mosses, it is thickened and waxy, forming a cuticle. Unlike aquatic plants, which obtain and excrete gases dissolved in water, land plants require an efficient means to exchange gases with the atmosphere. The epidermis of the bryophytes is provided with numerous pores for the diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen.

The plasma proteinsdo not diffuse readily through the capillary membrane. Therefore, there is a concentration gradient with four times as much protein in the plasma as in the interstitial fluid.

A dominant gene produces its effect in both the homozygous and heterozygous states. Geneticists, however, have found that many genes do not always produce their phenotypes when they should. Genes that always produce the expected phenotype in individuals who carry the gene in an expressible combi-nation are said to have completepenetrance.

Some genes that are expressed may show wide variations in the appearance of the character.

Expres-sivity is defined as the degree of effect or the extent to which a gene expresses itself in different individuals. If it exhibits the expected trait fully, then the gene is said to be completely expressed. If the expected trait is not expressed fully, the gene shows incomplete expres-sivity. The difference between the two terms-penetranceand expressivity, lies in the fact that the former is a function of the gene at the population level, while the latter varies on an individual level. Thus a given gene having a certainpenetrancewithin a population may have varying expressivity in individuals of that population who express it. Bothpenetranceand expressivity are functions of theinterractionof a given genotype with the environment. Changes in environmental conditions can change both thepenetranceand expressivity of a gene. For example, a given gene may code for an enzyme required for the synthesis of a given metabolite in bacteria. If that metabo-lite is provided in the organisms nutrient environment, the organism might not produce the enzymes needed for its synthesis, and then the gene will not be expressed. If however, the nutrient is depleted from the media, the organism will begin to manufacture the enzyme, and thus express the gene.

The difference between the two terms-penetranceand expressivity, lies in the fact that the former is a function of the gene at the population level, while the latter varies on an individual level. Thus a given gene having a certainpenetrancewithin a population may have varying expressivity in individuals of that population who express it. Bothpenetranceand expressivity are functions of theinterractionof a given genotype with the environment. Changes in environmental conditions can change both thepenetranceand expressivity of a gene. For example, a given gene may code for an enzyme required for the synthesis of a given metabolite in bacteria. If that metabo-lite is provided in the organisms nutrient environment, the organism might not produce the enzymes needed for its synthesis, and then the gene will not be expressed. If however, the nutrient is depleted from the media, the organism will begin to manufacture the enzyme, and thus express the gene. In humans, it is thought that allergy is caused by a single dominant gene; the different types of allergies are due to the varying expressivity of the gene, as a result of the interaction of the gene with both the environment and a given individual's genetic and physical make up."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nExplain what difficulties would arise if messenger RNA molecules were not destroyed after they had produced some polypeptide chains.\n\nOptions:\nA.

Plasma contains only water and no solutes.\nD. Only red blood cells affect the blood pressure.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAlthough the blood appears to be a red-colored homogeneous fluid as it flows from a wound, it is actually composed of cells contained within a liquid matrix. The yellowish, extracellular liquid matrix of the blood is called plasma. Suspended in it are three major types of formed elements: the red blood cells, or erythrocyte?, the white blood cells, or leukocytes, and the platelets, small disc-shaped cell fragments important in the clotting process. The cellular portion constitutes about 45% of the whole volume of blood, while plasma constitutes the other 55%. Since the cellular part of the blood has a higher specific gravity (the density of a substance relative to that of water) than plasma (1.09 vs. 1.03), the two may be separated by centrifugation. Although the plasma consists of 90% water, there are many substances dissolved in it. The concentrations of two of these substances, inorganic salts and plasma proteins, can affect the blood pressure. The major inorganiccations(positively charged ions) in the plasma are sodium (Na^+), calcium (Ca^2+), potassium (K^+), and magnesium (Mg^2+). The major inorganic anions (negatively charged ions) in the plasma include chloride (Cl^-), bicarbonate (HCO_3^-) , phosphate (PO_4^3-), and sulfate (SO_4^2-). The major salt is sodium chloride. In mammals, inorganic ions and salts make up .9% of the plasma by weight. Usually, the plasma concentration of these substances remain relatively stable due to a variety of regulatory mechanisms, such as the action of the kidneys and other excretory organs. But if the total concentration of dissol-ved substances is appreciably changed, serious disturbances can occur. For example, the concentration of sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO_3) determines the osmotic pressure of the plasma relative to the extracellular medium bathing the cells of the body. Normally, the osmotic pressure is balanced; however, if the concentrations of these salts are changed, the osmotic pressure of the plasma is changed and an osmotic gradient established. Water will then enter or leave the plasma by diffusion from the extracellular fluid. The resulting water loss or uptake will change the total blood volume. As with any fluid in a closed system, the volume of the blood directly affects the pressure it exerts on the walls of the vessel containing it. If the concentration of sodium chloride in the plasma is increased, water will tend to diffuse into the blood by osmosis, increasing its volume, which in turn increases the blood pressure. The proper balance of the individual ions is also essential to the normal functioning of nerves, muscles, and cell membranes. A deficiency of calcium ions, for instance, may cause severe muscular spasms, a condition called tetany. Certain ions, such as bicarbonate, affect the pH of the plasma, which is normally slightly alkaline at 7.4. Other important substances in the plasma that can affect blood pressure are the plasma proteins. Plasma proteins, which constitute about 9% of the plasma by weight, are of three types: fibrinogen, albumins and globulins. These substances contribute to the osmotic pressure of the plasma since they are too large to readily pass through the blood vessels. Their concentration affects the amount of water which diffuses into the blood, thereby regulating the general water balance in the body. In addition, these proteins determine the viscosity of the plasma. Viscosity is a measure of the resistance to flow caused by the friction between molecules as they pass one another. The heart can maintain normal blood pressure only if the viscosity of the blood is normal. For example, if the viscosity were to decrease, there would be less resistance to flow. There is a physical law which states that an increased flow rate (due to decreased resistance) will exert more pressure on the walls of the vessels transporting the fluid. Hence, this decreased viscosity leads to increased blood pressure; the viscosity of the blood is therefore inversely proportional to the blood pressure. In addition to inorganic ions and plasma proteins, plasma also contains organic nutrients such as glucose, fats, amino acids and phospholipids. It carries nitrogenous waste products, such as urea, to the kidneys. Hormones are also transported in the plasma. Dissolved gases are also transported, including carbon dioxide and oxygen, the gases involved in respiration.

Diploid phase becomes less dominant\nB. There is a change from a dominating population that is mostly haploid to one that is almost entirely diploid, gradual reduction in the dependence of fertilization on the presence of moisture, and greater embryonic protection.\nC.             There is a reduction in embryonic protection\nD. There is increased dependence on moisture for fertilization\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nIn the evolution from the algae to the flowering plants there is, first, a change from a domi-nating population that is mostly haploid to one that is almost entirely diploid. Inmulticellularfilamentous algae such aUlothrix, only one cell during the life cycle, namely the zygote, is diploid; all the rest are haploid. In mosses, the haploid phase is more conspicu-ous and long-lived than the diploid phase, but the latter has evolved a complex, multicellularplant body. The relative importance of the two phases is reversed in the ferns: the diploid phase is the obvious, larger plant, and the haploid gametophyte, though still an independent plant, is small and inconspicuous. Thegymnosperrasand angiosperms show progressive reductions of the haploid generation. In angiosperms, the male gametophyte consists only of three cells and the female gametophyte of eight cells. The evolutionary advantage of a long-lived, dominant sporophyteand a short-lived, inconspicu-ous gametophyte generation is that a diploid individual can survive despite the presence of a deleterious recessive gene. A haploid individual would be more susceptible to the effects of such genes, since there would be no way to counterbalance the lethality of such an allele. Besides the reduction of the gametophyte, there is a gradual reduction in the dependence of fertilization on the presence of moisture. Aquatic plants such as algae have motile sperm that swim to the eggs. Bryophytes and lower vascular plants, which develop on the ground near water, also require a moist habitat. The seed plants have replaced sperm motility by pollination. Pollen may be very light and carried by the wind over large distances. The angiosperms have further evolved showy floral parts and nectar glands to attract insects, birds and other animals which serve to carry pollen on their feet or fur. Pollination has thus two evolutionary advantages: it allows sperm transport and fertilization to occur without moisture, and it enables long distance dispersal of sperm cells. Greater embryonic protection is a third evolutionary trend in the life cycle of plants. The green algaeChlamydomonashas its zygote protected only within a thick wall. Bryophytes and lower vascular plants have their embryos developing within themulticellulararchegoniumwhich draws nutrients from the gametophyte. Gymnosperms and angiosperms have evolved a seed structure for main-taining and protecting the embryo independent of the gametophyte. The seed has contributed immensely to the success of the seed plants. The stored food nourishes the embryo and the tough outer coat protects it from heat, cold, desiccation, drying, and parasites. Seeds also provide an effective means for the dispersal of the species. They may be wind-borne, water-borne, or carried by animals. To secure even greater protection, the angi-osperms have evolved fruit which encloses one or more seeds. Fruits may either decay or be eaten by animals, liberating the seeds.", "ref_id": 1655, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Biology", "question": "What trends in the evolution of the life cycle are evident from the algae to flowering plants?", "options": ["Diploid phase becomes less dominant", "There is a change from a dominating population that is mostly haploid to one that is almost entirely diploid, gradual reduction in the dependence of fertilization on the presence of moisture, and greater embryonic protection.", "There is a reduction in embryonic protection", "There is increased dependence on moisture for fertilization"], "answer": "B", "solution": "In the evolution from the algae to the flowering plants there is, first, a change from a domi-nating population that is mostly haploid to one that is almost entirely diploid. Inmulticellularfilamentous algae such aUlothrix, only one cell during the life cycle, namely the zygote, is diploid; all the rest are haploid. In mosses, the haploid phase is more conspicu-ous and long-lived than the diploid phase, but the latter has evolved a complex, multicellularplant body. The relative importance of the two phases is reversed in the ferns: the diploid phase is the obvious, larger plant, and the haploid gametophyte, though still an independent plant, is small and inconspicuous. Thegymnosperrasand angiosperms show progressive reductions of the haploid generation. In angiosperms, the male gametophyte consists only of three cells and the female gametophyte of eight cells. The evolutionary advantage of a long-lived, dominant sporophyteand a short-lived, inconspicu-ous gametophyte generation is that a diploid individual can survive despite the presence of a deleterious recessive gene. A haploid individual would be more susceptible to the effects of such genes, since there would be no way to counterbalance the lethality of such an allele. Besides the reduction of the gametophyte, there is a gradual reduction in the dependence of fertilization on the presence of moisture. Aquatic plants such as algae have motile sperm that swim to the eggs. Bryophytes and lower vascular plants, which develop on the ground near water, also require a moist habitat. The seed plants have replaced sperm motility by pollination. Pollen may be very light and carried by the wind over large distances. The angiosperms have further evolved showy floral parts and nectar glands to attract insects, birds and other animals which serve to carry pollen on their feet or fur. Pollination has thus two evolutionary advantages: it allows sperm transport and fertilization to occur without moisture, and it enables long distance dispersal of sperm cells. Greater embryonic protection is a third evolutionary trend in the life cycle of plants. The green algaeChlamydomonashas its zygote protected only within a thick wall. Bryophytes and lower vascular plants have their embryos developing within themulticellulararchegoniumwhich draws nutrients from the gametophyte.

She then measures the blood pressure in the artery of the man's leg. The nurse obtains a different value. Why?\n\nOptions:\nA. The blood pressure is always the same in all parts of the body\nB. The blood pressure decreases as the blood moves further away from the heart\nC.             The nurse made a measurement error\nD. The man's leg has a different heart rate\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nDuring systole, the left ventricle contracts, forcing blood under pressure into the aorta and the arteries. Since the arterial walls are elastic (due to the elastic fibers in the outer layer of arteries), the rush of blood stretches the arteries and exerts a pressure on them. Blood pressure is the actual force exerted by the blood against any unit area of a vessel wall. The maximal pressure caused by the contraction of the heart is called the systolic pressure. In a normal adult at rest, the systolic pressure averages about 120 mm of mercury. This value means that the force exerted would be sufficient to push a column of mercury up to a level of 120 millimeters. During diastole, the heart relaxes and does exert a pressure on the arterial blood and the arterial pressure decreases. The stretched arterial walls recoil passively, maintaining some pressure which drives the blood. The pressure does not fall to zero during diastole because the next ventricular contraction occurs quickly enough to restore the pressure. The minimal pressure during the relaxation phase of the heart is called the diastolic pressure. The normal adult value is about 80 mm of mercury. The systolic and diastolic pressures are usually written as a fraction: 120/80. These values of blood pressure are only specific for the arteries in the upper arms. As the nurse should know, the blood pressure values are different in other parts of the body. The blood pressure decreases as the blood moves further away from the heart, with the lowest value occurring in the vena cava. The arterial pressure in the systemic circulation is inversely proportional to vascular resistance. That is, as resistance to blood flow increases, pressure decreases. Vascular resistance is directly proportional to the viscosity of the blood and the length of the vessel, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. This is Poiseuille'sLaw: R = [(8 n l) / (\\pi r 4)]where n = viscosity l = length r = radius All these factors tend to produce friction between the blood flowing in the vessel and the vessel walls, decreasing the blood pressure. Note that the single most important determinant of resistance is the radius of the vessel. In the aorta, the resistance is very low since the blood has not traveled far and the radius is large. Resistance in the large arteries is also low, so that the pressure is still about 100 mm Hg (Hg means mercury). The resistance begins to increase rapidly in the arterioles, as the radii of these vessels decrease. The pressure of the blood as it leaves the arterioles to enter the capillaries decreases to about 30 mm Hg. In the capillaries, the velocity of the blood flow is very low. The pressure at the beginning of the veins is about 10 mm Hg and decreases to almost 0 mm Hg at the right atrium. One would not expect the pressure to decrease so much in the veins since they are wider in width than the capillaries. This larger radius should cause a decrease in resistance. However, pressure in the veins does not increase because the walls of veins are easily distensible.Distensibilityarises from the fact that veins are not rigid structures; they have only a thin muscle coat.

No, viruses cannot cause cancer\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nCancer involves an abnormality in the control of cell division and cell function. Cancer cells usually produce cell masses called tumors. These cells lack the normal control systems that shut off unwanted cell division . The factors which give cancer cells their characteristic property of unregulated growth are passed on from parent to progeny cancer cells. For this reason, it has been suggested that genetic changes occur within chromosomal DNA. These changes lead to a heritable cancer phenotype. Somatic mutations (mutations in cells that are not destined to become gametes ) may cause a cancer, if the mutation upsets a normal device controlling cell regulation. Some indication that somatic mutations can induce cancer comes from the fact that manycarcinpgens(agents that cause cancer) are also strong mutagens (agents that cause mutations.) Ultraviolet and ionizing forms of radiation are powerful carcinogens and are also highly mutagenic. Exposure of skin to ultraviolet light frequently results in skin cancer, and x-rays applied to the thyroid are associated with increased incidence of thyroidcancer.Manychemicals are also highly carcinogenic and mutagenic . For example, nitrites and nitrates by themselves cause no genetic or carcinogenic changes, but in cells they may become converted to powerful carcinogens- the nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are also known to be mutagens. Nitrates and nitrites are found in cured meats (frankfurters, bacon, ham) and are used to inhibit growth of anaerobic bacteria . In contrast to the somatic mutation proposal is the hypothesis that most cancers are induced by viruses. Viruses which produce tumors in animals are calledonco-genicviruses. While somatic mutations are suspected to cause a loss of functional genetic material, viruses are vehicles into a cell: they introduce new genetic material that may transform the cell into a cancerous type. In addition to multiplying and lysing their host cell, certain viruses can insert their chromosomes into the host chromosome. In some animal species, this process can transform the cell into a morphologically distinguishable cancer cell. At this point, the virus is in theprophagestate. Therefore, absence of detectable viruses does not provide ample evidence for or against a viral cause of a cancer.

The DNA of the bacterial cell is generally confined to a specific area but this region is not enclosed by a membrane. In addition, proteins, such as thehistonesofeucaryotic cells , are not found in association with bacterial DNA. Another distinctive feature is that during replication of the bacterial nuclear region, the mitotic spindle apparatus is not seen. Bacterial cells also lack Golgiapparati, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. This means that theribosomesfound in the cytoplasmic region are free, i.e. they are not bound to endoplasmic reticulum . Membranous systems are not completely absent in bacteria. The plasma membrane folds inward at various points to formmesosomes. These membranes may be involved with the origin of other intra-cellular structures , and the compartmentalization and integration of biochemical systems . For example, although the electron transport system is located in the plasma membrane of bacteria, most of the respiratory enzymes are located in themesosomes. The plasma membrane andmesosomesare the bacterial counterpart of theeucaryoticcells' mitochondria, serving to compartmentalize the respiratory enzymes. Those bacteria that contain chlorophyll do not contain plastids to \"house\" the chlorophyll. Instead, the chlorophyll is associated with membranous vesicles arising from mesosomes ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA newborn infant is examined by a doctor, who determines that the child has syphilis.

Translocation is the movement of nutrients from the leaves to other parts of the plant body. Theories to explain this include the pressure-flow theory, cyclosis, and the theory of cytoplasmic tubules.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nTranslocation is the movement of nutrients from the leaves where theyare synthesized to other parts of the plant body where they are neededfor a wide variety of metabolic activities. Translocation takes place throughthe sieve tubes of the phloem. Experimental data indicates that the high rate at which translocation occurs cannot be attributed to simple diffusion. Three theories have been offered to explain the mechanism of translocation. Each of them has its own value and weakness, but the first one presented (pressure-flow theory ) holds the most support. The pressure-flow theory, which had been widely accepted in the past , proposes that the nutrient sap moves as a result of differences in turgor pressure. Sieve tubes of the phloem in the leaf contain a high concentration of sugars, which results in high osmotic pressure into the cells. This osmotic pressure causes an influx of water, and build up ofturgor pressure against the walls of the sieve tube cells. In the roots however, sugars are constantly being removed. Here, a lower concentration of solute is present resulting in a lowering of the osmotic pressure. There is consequently a lowerturgorpressure exerted against the sieve tube walls of the root as compared to the leaf. This difference inturgorpressure along the different regions at the phloem is believed to bring about the mass flow of nutrients from a region of high turgor pressure - such as the leaves (where photosynthe-sis produces osmotically -active substances like glucose) -toregions of lowerturgor pressure - such as the stem and roots. The fluid containing the nutrients is pushed by adjacent cells, along the gradient of decreasingturgor, from the leaves to the roots. This theory predicts that the sap should be under pressure as it moves down the phloem, and this is experimentally verified. But there are problems with this hypothesis. Under some conditions, sugar is clearly transported from cells of lesserturgorto cells of greaterturgor. In addition , this theory fails to explain how two substances can flow along the phloem in different directions at the same time, a situation observed to occur by some investigators. Another theory proposes thatcyclosis, the streaming movement evident in many plant cells, is responsible for translocation. According to this theory, materials pass into one end of a sieve tube through the sieve plate and are picked up by the cytoplasm which streams up one side of the cell and down the other. At the other end of the sieve tube, the material passes across the sieve plate to the next adjacent sieve tube by diffusion or active transport. This theory is able to account for the simultaneous flowing of nutrient saps in different direc-tions. However, it is attacked by some investigators on the basis thatcyclosishas not been observed in mature sieve cells. A third theory proposes that adjacent sieve-tube cells are connected bycytoplasmictubules, in which sugars and other substances pass from cell to cell. The movement of these substances is powered by the ATP from the mitochondria-like particles that are believed to lie within these connecting tubules.

By observing their hunting tools\nB. By comparing size and shape of teeth, jaw structure, and cranium\nC.             By using DNA analysis\nD. By studying their cave paintings\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nOf all the fossils discovered relevant to the evolution of man, the craniums, jaws, and teeth have been the most numerous and useful. Teeth have been found in large numbers at archaeological sites because their enamel coating gives them great durability. Teeth are complex structures with many distinctive features. The size and shape of the cusps, and the root size of the fossil teeth can be compared with modern man's dental anatomy and to that of modern apes. In this manner, a fossil man can be placed in a chronological and evolutionary relationship to otherhominiod-like forms, whether they be extinct or extant. Much can also be said about our ancestor's diet by studying the structure of a fossil's teeth. For example, there is an evolutionary trend towards reduction in size of the canine teeth in man's evolution (see Figure). Man and apes are charac-terized by larger canines. Since the canines are used in tearing raw meat, the reduction in their size would seem to parallel the evolution of man's mode of feeding and his diet. A major problem encountered by anthropologists is the absence of teeth from many of the jaws that are found. It becomes difficult to determine the exact number and size of the teeth when the jaw is not complete. As a general rule, the size of the jaw is directly related to the size of the teeth. For instance, man has charac-teristically both smaller teeth and smaller jaws than his predecessors. The shape of the jaw alone is also an important evolutionary indicator. The dental arch, or portion of the jaw where the teeth are attached, is rectangular in the apes and parabolic in man. This indi-cates that in the apes, the back teeth on either side of the jaw are parallel to each other, with the incisors in a straight row. In man and some of his fossil ancestors, parabolic dental arches are present wherein the distance between the canines on either side of the jaw is smaller than that between the molars. The structure and size of the teeth, the ridges on the jaw, and the dimensions and shape of the dental arch indicate how the face may have looked, and the nature of the diet. If the fossil man ate hard, rough objects that required teeth with effective chewing and grinding surfaces, we would most likely observe huge molars that have undergone much wear, and jaws with large ridges for attachment of strong chewing muscles. Enlarged chewing muscles are also accompanied by large ridges on the sides and top of the skull, since thetemporalismuscles used for chewing originate in the skull region in hominoids, although not always in the same place. Huge neck muscles would also be accompanied by large ridges on the skull. This would indicatequadrupedalism. If the animal was quadruped, huge neck muscles would be needed to support the neck, and obvious muscle ridges would be present in the skull. If the animal was bipedal, the neck muscles and ridges would be reduced since the head would now be balanced on the spinal column. The centered position of the head indicatingbipedalismcan be further determined by the position of the foramen magnum.Bidepalorganisms like man have the foramen magnum located underneath the center of the brain, while in apes, the foramen magnum is located toward the rear of the skull. The overall dimensions of the braincase are im-portant in determining an animal's cranial capacity. If the skulls of the various fossil men are put into a chronological sequence, a trend toward increasing brain size is noticed as well as a general thinning of the skull bones. A great deal of the information indicated above is still to a large degree speculative, since skulls, jaws, or teeth are rarely found in their original form without great amounts of weathering and fragmentation.", "ref_id": 1692, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Biology", "question": "How can we deduce information about prehistoric man from the fossil teeth, jaws, and craniums found?", "options": ["By observing their hunting tools", "By comparing size and shape of teeth, jaw structure, and cranium", "By using DNA analysis", "By studying their cave paintings"], "answer": "B", "solution": "Of all the fossils discovered relevant to the evolution of man, the craniums, jaws, and teeth have been the most numerous and useful.

In this manner, a fossil man can be placed in a chronological and evolutionary relationship to otherhominiod-like forms, whether they be extinct or extant. Much can also be said about our ancestor's diet by studying the structure of a fossil's teeth. For example, there is an evolutionary trend towards reduction in size of the canine teeth in man's evolution (see Figure). Man and apes are charac-terized by larger canines. Since the canines are used in tearing raw meat, the reduction in their size would seem to parallel the evolution of man's mode of feeding and his diet. A major problem encountered by anthropologists is the absence of teeth from many of the jaws that are found. It becomes difficult to determine the exact number and size of the teeth when the jaw is not complete. As a general rule, the size of the jaw is directly related to the size of the teeth. For instance, man has charac-teristically both smaller teeth and smaller jaws than his predecessors. The shape of the jaw alone is also an important evolutionary indicator. The dental arch, or portion of the jaw where the teeth are attached, is rectangular in the apes and parabolic in man. This indi-cates that in the apes, the back teeth on either side of the jaw are parallel to each other, with the incisors in a straight row. In man and some of his fossil ancestors, parabolic dental arches are present wherein the distance between the canines on either side of the jaw is smaller than that between the molars. The structure and size of the teeth, the ridges on the jaw, and the dimensions and shape of the dental arch indicate how the face may have looked, and the nature of the diet. If the fossil man ate hard, rough objects that required teeth with effective chewing and grinding surfaces, we would most likely observe huge molars that have undergone much wear, and jaws with large ridges for attachment of strong chewing muscles. Enlarged chewing muscles are also accompanied by large ridges on the sides and top of the skull, since thetemporalismuscles used for chewing originate in the skull region in hominoids, although not always in the same place. Huge neck muscles would also be accompanied by large ridges on the skull. This would indicatequadrupedalism. If the animal was quadruped, huge neck muscles would be needed to support the neck, and obvious muscle ridges would be present in the skull. If the animal was bipedal, the neck muscles and ridges would be reduced since the head would now be balanced on the spinal column. The centered position of the head indicatingbipedalismcan be further determined by the position of the foramen magnum.Bidepalorganisms like man have the foramen magnum located underneath the center of the brain, while in apes, the foramen magnum is located toward the rear of the skull. The overall dimensions of the braincase are im-portant in determining an animal's cranial capacity. If the skulls of the various fossil men are put into a chronological sequence, a trend toward increasing brain size is noticed as well as a general thinning of the skull bones. A great deal of the information indicated above is still to a large degree speculative, since skulls, jaws, or teeth are rarely found in their original form without great amounts of weathering and fragmentation."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDescribe the various land biomes that are usually encounteredby a traveler going from the equator to the arcticpolar ice cap.\n\nOptions:\nA.

The interlocking canopy of leaves blocks out the sun and allowsonly dim light to penetrate. As a result, the ground is sparsely coveredwith small plants.

It also shields the lower levels from wind and hencegreatly reduces the rate of evaporation. The lower levels of theforst areconsequently very humid. Temperatures near the forest floor are nearlyconstant. The pronounced differences in conditions at different levels within sucha forest result in a striking degree of vertical stratification. Many speciesof animals and epiphytic plants (plants growing on large trees) occuronly in the canopy, while others occur only in the middle strata and stillothers occur only on the forest floor. Decomposition of fallen leaves anddead wood is so rapid that humus is even missing in spots on the floor. The diversity of life here is the greatest found anywhere on earth. In asingle square mile of the richest tropical rain forests, hundreds of speciesof trees, hundreds more of birds, butterflies, reptiles and amphibians, and dozens of species of mammals make their habitat. Huge areas in both the temperate and tropical regions of the world arecovered by grassland biomes. These are typically areas with relatively lowtotal annual rainfall or uneven seasonal occurrence of rainfall. This typeof climate is unfavorable for forests but suitable for growth of grasses. Temperate and tropical grasslands are remarkably similar in appearance, althoughthe particular species they contain may be very different. In both cases, there are usually vast numbers of large herbivores, which often includethe ungulates (hoofed animals). Burrowing rodents orrodentlike animalsare also often common. North of the tropics, in the temperate regions of Europe and eastern North America, are deciduous forests. Small creepers and epiphytes such aslichens and mosses may be found, but they are not so conspicuous an inthe rain forests. There is richer vegetation on the ground below, which is oftencovered by a carpet of herbs. Such a forest may be called temperate deciduousforest. In those parts of the temperate zone where rainfall is abundantand the summers are relatively long and warm, the climax communitiesare frequently dominated by broad-leaved trees, whose leaveschange color in autumn then fall off in winter and grow back in the spring. North of the deciduous forest of temperate North America and Eurasia is a wide zone dominated by coniferous (cone-bearing) forests sometimesreferred to as the boreal forests. This is the taiga biome. Instead of being bushy-topped, the trees are mostly of the triangular Christmas-tree shape.The trees of the boreal forest are evergreens, cone-bearingand needle-leaved consisting mostly of spruce, fir, and tamarack. They branch over most of their height and are relatively close-packed. The land is dotted by lakes, ponds and bogs. The winters of thetaiga are very cold and during the warm summers, the subsoil thaws andvegetation flourishes. Moose, black bears, wolves, lynx, wolverines, martens, squirrels, and many smaller rodents are important in the taiga communities. Birds are abundant in summer. The territory of the boreal forest is hundreds of miles wide, but eventuallyit meets the completely treeless vegetation of the tundra. The tundrais the most continuous of the earth's biomes, forming a circular bandaround the North pole, interrupted only narrowly by the North Atlantic andthe Bearing Sea. The vegetation of the tundra resembles grassland butit is actually made up of a mixture of lichens, mosses, grasses, sedges andlow growing willows and other shrubs. There are numerous perennial herbs, which are able to withstand frequent freezing and which grow rapidlyduring the brief cool summers, often carpeting the tundra with brightlycolored flowers. A permanent layer of frozen soil lies a few inches toa few feet beneath the surface. It prevents the roots of trees and other deepgrowing plants from becoming established, and it slows the drainage ofsurface water. As a result, the flat portions of the tundra are dotted with shallowlakes and bogs, and the soil between them is exceptionally wet. Reindeer, lemmings, caribou, arctic wolves, foxes and hares are among theprincipal mammals, while polar bears are common on parts of the tundranear the coast. Vast numbers of birds,particularyshorebirds and waterfowl(ducks, geese, etc.), nest on the tundra in summer, but they are notpermanent inhabitants and migrate south for the winter. Insects are incrediblyabundant. In short, the tundra is far from being a barren lifeless land; but the number of different species is quite limited. The succession of biomes between the equator and the Arctic is roughlymirrored in the Southern Hemisphere, although the absence of largelandmasses makes the pattern less complete. There are also some otherbiomes that are more irregularly scattered about the world, but which havea distinctive form. These are the biomes of the desert regions and thesclerophylousbushlands. Thebushlands, common in the chaparral of California,maquisof theMediterranean and themalleeheath of Australia, are made up of differentspecies of plants, but have much in common. They have gnarled andtwisted, rough and thorny plants. The leaves tend to be dark and are hairy, leathery, or thickly cutinized.

During the day they are exposedto intense sunlight, and the temperature of both air and soil may risevery high. But in the absence of the moderating influence of abundant vegetation, heat is rapidly lost at night, and a short while after sunset, searingheat has usually given way to bitter cold. Some deserts, such as partsof the Sahara, are nearly barren of vegetation, but more commonly thereare scattered drought-resistant shrubs and succulent plants that can storemuch water in their tissues.

Temperate and tropical grasslands are remarkably similar in appearance, althoughthe particular species they contain may be very different. In both cases, there are usually vast numbers of large herbivores, which often includethe ungulates (hoofed animals). Burrowing rodents orrodentlike animalsare also often common. North of the tropics, in the temperate regions of Europe and eastern North America, are deciduous forests. Small creepers and epiphytes such aslichens and mosses may be found, but they are not so conspicuous an inthe rain forests. There is richer vegetation on the ground below, which is oftencovered by a carpet of herbs. Such a forest may be called temperate deciduousforest. In those parts of the temperate zone where rainfall is abundantand the summers are relatively long and warm, the climax communitiesare frequently dominated by broad-leaved trees, whose leaveschange color in autumn then fall off in winter and grow back in the spring. North of the deciduous forest of temperate North America and Eurasia is a wide zone dominated by coniferous (cone-bearing) forests sometimesreferred to as the boreal forests. This is the taiga biome. Instead of being bushy-topped, the trees are mostly of the triangular Christmas-tree shape.The trees of the boreal forest are evergreens, cone-bearingand needle-leaved consisting mostly of spruce, fir, and tamarack. They branch over most of their height and are relatively close-packed. The land is dotted by lakes, ponds and bogs. The winters of thetaiga are very cold and during the warm summers, the subsoil thaws andvegetation flourishes. Moose, black bears, wolves, lynx, wolverines, martens, squirrels, and many smaller rodents are important in the taiga communities. Birds are abundant in summer. The territory of the boreal forest is hundreds of miles wide, but eventuallyit meets the completely treeless vegetation of the tundra.

There are numerous perennial herbs, which are able to withstand frequent freezing and which grow rapidlyduring the brief cool summers, often carpeting the tundra with brightlycolored flowers. A permanent layer of frozen soil lies a few inches toa few feet beneath the surface. It prevents the roots of trees and other deepgrowing plants from becoming established, and it slows the drainage ofsurface water. As a result, the flat portions of the tundra are dotted with shallowlakes and bogs, and the soil between them is exceptionally wet. Reindeer, lemmings, caribou, arctic wolves, foxes and hares are among theprincipal mammals, while polar bears are common on parts of the tundranear the coast.

The interlocking canopy of leaves blocks out the sun and allowsonly dim light to penetrate. As a result, the ground is sparsely coveredwith small plants. The canopy also interrupts the direct fall of the plentifulrain, but water drips from it to the forest floor much of the time, evenwhen it is not raining. It also shields the lower levels from wind and hencegreatly reduces the rate of evaporation. The lower levels of theforst areconsequently very humid. Temperatures near the forest floor are nearlyconstant. The pronounced differences in conditions at different levels within sucha forest result in a striking degree of vertical stratification. Many speciesof animals and epiphytic plants (plants growing on large trees) occuronly in the canopy, while others occur only in the middle strata and stillothers occur only on the forest floor. Decomposition of fallen leaves anddead wood is so rapid that humus is even missing in spots on the floor. The diversity of life here is the greatest found anywhere on earth.

Tuberculosis, infections, allergic reactions such as hay fever and allergic asthma, lung cancer, emphysema, and respiratory distress syndrome are some abnormalities of the respiratory tract.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe respiratory tract is subject to various infections and damages which may interfere with normal functioning. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteriaMycobacterium tuberculosisand results in the destruction of lung tissue. It was once a major cause of death. In-fectious bacteria or viruses can bring about infections in the nasal cavities, the sinuses, the throat, the larynx (laryngitis), the bronchial tubes (bronchitis), and the lungs (pneumonia). Pneumonia, which may result from infection by bacteria or viruses, results in the filling of the alveoli with fluid. As the infection spreads through-out the lungs, the surface area for gas exchange is reduced. Allergic reactions may also occur in the respiratory tract. They occur when a person becomes sensitized to certain substances in the air, such as pollution, smoke or pollen. A person who is allergic to these substances has a condition known as hay fever. In such people, allergic reactions are initiated in the nasal cavities. Should these substances pass into the bronchioles and not be filtered in the nasal cavities, allergic asthma may result. The bronchiole tubes swell and become clogged with mucus, and the person has respiratory difficulty. It has long been known that cigarette smoking can cause cancer in the lungs. It is not as widely known, however, that it can also result in emphysema. Emphysema results from a thickening of the lung tissues, which causes a loss of elasticity and a loss in the ability to absorb oxygen. In extreme cases the vital capacity is so reduced that breathing becomes a major effort. Since exercise requires increased oxygen consumption, physical activity is greatly reduced in people with emphysema. Alveolar cells secrete a detergent-like chemical called surfactant, which intersperses with the water molecules in the alveoli. The air within each alveolus is separated from the alveolar membrane by an extremely thin layer of fluid. Surfactant markedly reduces the water molecules cohesive force, thereby decreasing the surface tension. If the surfactant were absent, this tension would be strong enough to cause the alveoli to collapse. In some newborn infants, predominantly those born prematurely, the lungs do not secrete an adequate amount of surfactant for their inspiratory forces to over-come the surface tension. Hence their alveoli are unable to expand when they inhale. Without treatment, these infants die of suffocation.

Pathogens are incapable of surviving outside a host.\nB. Pathogens are always killed by the host's immune system.\nC.             The success of a pathogen depends on its successful transmittance to a new host via air, food, water, insects, or by contact.\nD. Pathogens can only survive within their original host.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nA virulent pathogen will eventually die if it is restricted to its original host . The host produces substances which either prevent the growth and spread of the pathogen or actually destroy it. Even if the host fails to do this , a virulent pathogen will bring about its own destruction by killing the host that sustains it. For the pathogen to survive and cause disease in a number of organisms, it must find new hosts to infect. Communicable pathogens are transferred from one host to another by a number of means. Pathogens of the respira-tory tract, such as Diplococcus pneumoniae, can leave the body in discharges from the mouth , nose and throat. Sneezing and coughing expedite the spread of these or-ganisms. Enteric (intestinal) pathogens, such as those which cause typhoid fever, leave the host in fecal excre-tions and sometimes in the urine. The bacteria in these wastes contaminate the food and water which a subsequent host may ingest. Other pathogens cannot live long outside a host and are transmitted by direct contact, most commonly through breaks in the skin or contact of mucous mem-branes. The final common means of transmittance is by certain insect vectors, although these insects may be carried further by other organisms such as rats and man .

The host produces substances which either prevent the growth and spread of the pathogen or actually destroy it. Even if the host fails to do this , a virulent pathogen will bring about its own destruction by killing the host that sustains it. For the pathogen to survive and cause disease in a number of organisms, it must find new hosts to infect. Communicable pathogens are transferred from one host to another by a number of means. Pathogens of the respira-tory tract, such as Diplococcus pneumoniae, can leave the body in discharges from the mouth , nose and throat. Sneezing and coughing expedite the spread of these or-ganisms. Enteric (intestinal) pathogens, such as those which cause typhoid fever, leave the host in fecal excre-tions and sometimes in the urine. The bacteria in these wastes contaminate the food and water which a subsequent host may ingest. Other pathogens cannot live long outside a host and are transmitted by direct contact, most commonly through breaks in the skin or contact of mucous mem-branes. The final common means of transmittance is by certain insect vectors, although these insects may be carried further by other organisms such as rats and man .

Bacterial size and shape\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nVirulence is the degree of ability in micro-organisms to produce disease . Some organisms are more virulent than others. There are several factors influencing virulence. One of these is the production of toxins which are poisonous substances produced by some microorganisms. Both the ability to produce the toxin and the potency of the toxin affect the organism's capability to produce disease. Toxins which are secreted into the surrounding medium during cellular growth are calledexotoxins, and toxins retained in the cell during growth and released upon cell death and lysis are calledendotoxins.Exotoxinsare released into the surrounding medium , e.g., into a can of vegetables containingClostridiumbotulinum (thebacterium causing botulism) or into damaged tissue infected with Clostridium tetani(the bacterium causing tetanus). Both these types of bacteria exhibit difficulty in penetrating the host. However, these bacteria are virulent because of their toxins. When the spatial configuration of the amino acids in a toxin molecule is altered, the toxicity is lost, and the resulting substance is called atoxoid. Both toxins andtoxoidsare able to stimulate the production of anti-toxins, substances made by the host which are capable of neutralizing the toxin.Endotoxinsare liberated only when the microorganism disintegrate and are generally less toxic than exotoxins . They do not formtoxoidsand are usuallypyroqenic,inducinq fever in the host (someexo-toxinsproduce fever also).Exotoxinsare usually associated with gram-positive bacteria whileendotoxinsar associated with the gram-negative ones. Another factor influencing virulence is the ability of bacteria to enter the host and penetrate host tissue. Specific bacterial enzymes are involved . One enzyme that is produced by some of the Clostridia and cocci ishyaluronidase. This enzyme facilitates the spread of the pathogen by aiding itspenetranceinto host tissues. It hydrolyzeshyaluronicacid, an essential tissue \"cement\", and thus increases the permeability of tissue spaces to both the pathogen and its toxic products. The virulence of pathogens is also influenced by their ability to resist destruction by the host. In certain bacteria, this resistance is due to the presence of a non-toxic polysaccharide material which forms a capsule surrounding the bacterial cell. For example,pneumococciare Streptococcus pnemoniaevirulent when capsulated but are oftenavirulent when not capsulated.

The presence of the X chromosome determines the sex.\nB. The number of chromosomes determines the sex.\nC.             The presence of the Y chromosome determines that an individual will be male. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in a female offspring, and by a Y-bearing sperm results in a male offspring.\nD. The size of the chromosomes determines the sex.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe sex chromosomes are an exception to the general rule that the members of a pair of chromosomes are identical in size and shape and carry allelic pairs. The sex chromosomes are not homologous chromosomes . In man, the cells of females contain two identicalsex chromosomes or X chromosomes. In males there is only one X chromosome and a smaller Y chromosome with which the X pairs during meiotic synapsis. Men have 22 pairs of ordinary chromosomes (autosomes), plus one X and one Y chromosome, and women have 22 pairs ofautosomesplus two X chromosomes. Thus it is the presence of the Y chromosome which determines that an individual will be male. Although the mechanism is quite complex, we know that the presence of the Y chromosome stimulates thegonadal medulla , or sex-organ forming portion of the egg; to develop into male gonads , or sex-organs. In theabscenceof the Y chromosome, and in the presence of two X chromo-somes, the medulla develops into female gametes . [Note, that a full complement of two X chromosomes are needed for normal female development.] In man, since the male has one X and one Y chromosome, two types of sperm, or male gametes, are produced during spermatogenesis (theprocess of sperm formation, which includes meiosis) One half of the sperm population contains an X chromosome and the other half contains a Y chromosome. Each egg, or female gamete, contains a single X chromosome . This is because a female has only X chromo-somes, and meiosis produces only gametes with X chromo-somes.

The sex chromosomes are not homologous chromosomes . In man, the cells of females contain two identicalsex chromosomes or X chromosomes. In males there is only one X chromosome and a smaller Y chromosome with which the X pairs during meiotic synapsis. Men have 22 pairs of ordinary chromosomes (autosomes), plus one X and one Y chromosome, and women have 22 pairs ofautosomesplus two X chromosomes. Thus it is the presence of the Y chromosome which determines that an individual will be male. Although the mechanism is quite complex, we know that the presence of the Y chromosome stimulates thegonadal medulla , or sex-organ forming portion of the egg; to develop into male gonads , or sex-organs. In theabscenceof the Y chromosome, and in the presence of two X chromo-somes, the medulla develops into female gametes . [Note, that a full complement of two X chromosomes are needed for normal female development.] In man, since the male has one X and one Y chromosome, two types of sperm, or male gametes, are produced during spermatogenesis (theprocess of sperm formation, which includes meiosis) One half of the sperm population contains an X chromosome and the other half contains a Y chromosome. Each egg, or female gamete, contains a single X chromosome . This is because a female has only X chromo-somes, and meiosis produces only gametes with X chromo-somes. Fertilization of the X-bearing egg by an X-bearing sperm results in an XX, or female offspring . The ferti-lization of an X-bearing egg byaY-bearing sperm results in an XY, or male offspring.

What are some conditions that cause the rate to change?\n\nOptions:\nA. The 'basal metabolic rate' is the total energy intake of an individual.\nB. The 'basal metabolic rate' is the energy expended during physical activity.\nC.             The 'basal metabolic rate' refers to the amount of energy expended by the body under resting conditions.\nD. The 'basal metabolic rate' is the energy required for digestion.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe \"basal metabolic rate\" refers to the amount of energy expended byonesbody under resting conditions. For example, sitting at rest in a room at a comfortable temperature requires 100 kcal. each hour for an \"average\" 70 kg. man. If another man who weighs 70 kg. requires only 95 kcal. per resting hour, his metabolic rate is 5% below the norm. The basal metabolic rate is the measure of the amount of energy utilized just to keep alive, when no food is being digested and no muscular work is being done. The average minimum energy requirement for young adult men is 1600 kcal. each day, and is about 5% less for women. To measure the basal rate, the subject is rested for 12 hours after the last meal, and reclined for 30 minutes at room temperature (18\\textdegree- 26\\textdegreeC). Pure oxygen is inhaled for an hour. It is known that the body absorbs only one fifth of the oxygen inhaled and that the body produces 4.8 kcal of energy for each liter of oxygen absorbed. Therefore, the basal metabolic rate can be calculated by measuring a person's oxygen consumption over a given time span. The amount of heat produced can be determined from the amount of oxygen consumed. By directly measuring the heat given off by a person in an insulated chamber, one can also measure the basal metabolic rate directly, but this is a more awkward process. The energy, requirement per square meter of body surface can also be calculated, and is found to be directly proportional to one's basal metabolic rate (BMR). The average energy expenditure is 40 kcal. per square meter. The BMR is a useful indicator of the state of one's metabolism. This is important for the diagnosis of certain hormonal disorders such as diabetes or goiter. Several factors influence one's metabolic rate. Children have high metabolic rates and aging adults have low rates. The female metabolic rate is below that of a male of similar size but it increases during pregnancy and lactation. Digestion requires about one tenth of the metabolic energy. Any infection or disease raises the metabolic rate and causes fever. Fever, in turn, raises the rate further and results in a loss of weight. Hormones and environmental conditions also play a major role in determining one's metabolic rate. Mental tension increases adrenalin production, raising the metabolic rate, blood pressure and heart rate. Adrenalin production can only continue for a few hours. The body will adjust to the presence of the stimulant and the sudden termination in its production drastically lowers the metabolic rate far below normal. There is a slowing of the heart rate, a drop in blood pressure, a shifting of blood to the intestines, and a decrease in blood sugar level. The largest influence on metabolism is muscular activity. During hard work, one's metabolic rate will double and may even reach fifteen times the BMR in brief bursts of activity.", "ref_id": 1726, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Biology", "question": "What is meant by the term basal metabolic rate?

Climate may be a majorfactor in determining what types of species will follow one another, butsuccession itself results from other changes. The most important of theseare the modifications of the physical environment produced by the communityitself. Mostsuccessionalcommunities tend to alter the area in whichthey occur in such a way as to make it less favorable for themselves andmore favorable for other communities. In effect, each community in thesuccession sows the seeds of its own destruction. Consider the alterations initiated by pioneer com-munities on land.

Succession in such casesoccurs simply because slower growing trees rise to dominance at a latertime and alteration of the environment therefore may have nothing to dowith re-placement.

Such a mutation would have to have occurred somewhere in the genes of the normal chromosomal complement of the egg during meiosis, and so coded for a trait not found in theunmutated genes of the sperm. If the trait was indeed caused by such a mutation, we would have to propose a hypothesis that the same mutation happens to all mothers of that species, and that every mother, but not the fathers, are affected . Such a hypothesis is extremely unlikely since mutation rates are by definition very low. This inheritance also cannot be accounted for by the absence of certain genes in the father. If this were true, the first generation offspring would inherit that from their mothers but not their fathers. However in the matings of the offspring of the first generation, the special mode of inheritance would no longer be observed. This is because both the male and female offspring of the first generation will have equal chance of possessing the gene responsible for that trait from their mother. Thus, second generationoffspringswill not necessarily inherit the characteristic from their mothers as opposed to the fathers. Let us apply our knowledge of gamete formation to the problem. We know that spermatogenesis gives rise to sperm which contain little or no cytoplasm.Oogenesisproduces large eggs with enormous amounts of cytoplasm . A small but significant amount of DNA may be present in the cytoplasm . This DNA may carry genes that are not carried on the DNA of the chromosomes. Such genes are called extrachromosomal genes. A male is unable to transmit the traits of such genes, even if he possesses them in his body cells, because his gametes, the sperm, are not formed with any substantial amount of cytoplasm. The female, because of the large amounts of cytoplasm incorporated in the formation of her gamete, the egg, transmit the gene. Thus, we see that an extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother. It can be expressed in both male and female offspring , but only the females will be able to transmit the trait to the next generation ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhy do ecologists not attempt to divide the ocean intobiome typeslike those on land?

Electron microscopes only provide high magnification, not high resolution.\nC.             Microscopes are limited by their size and weight.\nD. Light microscopes can distinguish objects closer than 275 nanometers.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAll microscopes are characterized by limits of resolution. Resolution refers to the clarity of the image. Objects lying close to one another can not be distinguished (resolved) as separate objects if the distance between them is less than one half the wavelength of the light being used. The average wave-length of visible light is 550 nanometers (or 5500 \\AA). Thus, for light microscopes, objects can be distinguished only if they lie farther apart than about 275 nanometers. Objects closer together than 275 nm are not resolved and appear to be one object. Increasing the size of image, or the magnification, will not give meaningful information unless resolution is also increased. Increasing magnification without increasing resolution results in a larger image that is still blurred. Electron microscopes offer resolution of details separated by .1 to .5 nanometers. Electrons, rather than light, are the radiation used in electron micros-copes. Recall that electrons have a wave property in addition to a particle property and may be regarded as a radiation of extremely short wavelength. Since the wavelength of an electron in motion is so much shorter than the wavelength of light, resolution is more than a thousandfold better.

When the muscle is still intact within the frog, the muscle cells should be undergoing aerobic respiration, since oxygen is available to each cell (by diffusion from the blood). However, once the muscle is removed and placed in an anaerobic environment , aerobic respiration is replaced by homolactic fermentation. Recall that this process involves the reduction of pyruvic acid to lactic acid due to the absence of any hydrogen acceptors. (see previous question) The build-up of lactic acid produces fatigue and muscle cramps. Since glycolysis produces only 2 net ATP per glucose molecule consumed, the ATP produced thus is not sufficient to replenish the ATP expended in muscle contraction. Eventually, the cell's ATP storage is depleted and conraction can no longer occur. However, when the container is opened, oxygen is reintroduced and is now available to accept hydrogen. Lactic acid is first converted back to pyruvic acid which eventually enters the TCA cycle and the respiratory system to produce more ATP. The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration with the concomitant increase in ATP production and oxidation of lactic acid back to pyruvic acid. This oxidation occurs in the liver. Under these conditions, the muscle regains its ability to contract. The same process occurs in humans after vigorous exercise. For example, once exercise is finished, heavy breathing continues. Such is the body's reaction in order to carry oxygen to the muscles as quickly as possible to repay the oxygen debt. Often this term is misleading, for oxygen debt does not mean the amount of oxygen the cells owe. Rather, it indicates the need of oxygen to oxidize the lactic acid accumulated when the cells are respiring anaerobically.

Nitrogen is an essential element in the synthesis of amino acids and thus proteins; nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, NAD, and NADP; chlorophyll (and other similar organic molecules with complex ring structures ); the nucleic acids, DNA and RNA; and many vitamins, such as the vitamin B group. Potassium regulates the conformation of some proteins , and affects some enzymatic reactions in the synthesis of biomolecules . It also affects water and ion balance by its' osmotic effects. Calcium is a structural component of the cell wall - it combines withpectic acid in the middle lamella of the plant cell wall. It also plays a part in cell growth and division, and is a cofactor for some enzymes. Phosphorous occurs in the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA and RNA, in nucleotides such as ADP and ATP, and in the phos-pholipids of the cell membrane. Magnesium is a structural part of the chlorophyll molecule and an activator of many enzymes. It functions in formation of amino acids, vitamins, fats and sugars.Sulferoccurs in coenzyme A and in some amino acids and proteins . The micronutrients include iron, chlorines, copper, manganese, zinc , molybdenum, and boron. Iron is a structural component of the electron carriers, thecytoch-romesandferredoxin, and is thus extremely important in the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Chlorine regulates osmosis and ionic balance in the cell. It may play a role in root and shoot growth. Copper, manganese and zinc are currently found to be activators of some enzymes. Copper is used in carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and with manganese, it functions in chlorophyll synthesis . Zinc is used in the formation ofauxin, chloroplasts and starch. Molybdenum is believed to be involved in nitrogen metabolism. Boron influences calcium ion uptake and utilization by the cell, and is suggested to be involved in carbohydrate transport as well. It affects cell division, flowering, pollen germination and nitrogen metabolism.

How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?\n\nOptions:\nA. Severing either root causes paralysis\nB. Severing the dorsal root won't have an effect\nC.             Severing the dorsal root will lead to loss of sensation and reflex action, but if the ventral root is severed, the rat would sense the stimulation but would not be able to react.\nD. Severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nA cross-section of the spinal cord (see problem 26-16) reveals that the paired dorsal roots are the junctions where sensory fibers from the peripheral receptor areas enter, while the paired ventral roots are where axons of the motor neurons leave the spinal cord to effectors, such as muscles. When the dorsal root of a spinal nerve is cut, the sensory fibers are severed and afferent impulses (that is impulses to the nervous system) can no longer reach the spinal cord and thence the brain. If a hot iron is brought to touch the leg of a rat, in which the dorsal root of the nerve leading to the leg is severed, the rat will not feel any burn sensation, as evidenced by its lack of attempt to avoid the stimulus. Since the receptor cells on the skin of the leg are not impaired, they do respond to the stimulus by firing impulses along the sensory fibers to the spinal cord. However, the impulses cannot reach the central nervous system and there-fore cannot be translated and interpreted in the brain.

A person'sbasal metabolic rate (BMR) usually approximates his metabolic rateimmediately after awakening, when he is not physically active and onlythe necessary metabolic processes to maintain life are occurring. The BMR varies with age, height, weight and sex, as well as with certain abnormalitiessuch as thyroid disease. The thyroid gland produces the hormonethyroxine, which regulates the rate of cellular metabolism. An abnormalBMR may indicate abnormalthyroxinelevels.BMR has been measuredby placing a person in a chamber and measuring the amount of heatgiven off (since heat is a by-product of metabolism), but such is an awkwardand difficult method. The BMR is more easily determined by indirectlymeasuring the amount of oxygen used in a given period of time. Since any oxygen used will serve as the final electron acceptor in respiration, the amount of oxygen used is proportional to the metabolic rate. Another common method entails measuring the amount ofthyroxine presentin a person's blood.

Using Pauling's scale, where fluorine is arbitrarily given the value 4.0 units and other elements are assigned values relative to it, anelectronegativitydifference of 1.7 gives the bond 50 percent ionic character and 50 percent covalent character. Therefore, a bond between two atoms with an electronegativity difference of greater than 1.7 units is mostly ionic in character. If the difference is less than 1.7 the bond is predominately covalent."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat factors determine the characteristics ofparticular organismsthat exist in an ecosystem.\n\nOptions:\nA.

Density dependent controls occur when a population's habitat changes.\nB. Density dependent controls occur solely due to predation.\nC.             Density dependent controls occur when the population density decreases.\nD. Density dependent controls occur when regulatory factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAn important characteristic of a population is its density, which is thenumber of individuals per unit area. A more useful term to ecologists is ecologicdensity, which is the number of individuals per habitable unit area. As the ecologic density of a given population begins to increase, thereare regulatory factors that tend to oppose the growth. These regulatingmechanisms operate to maintain a population at its optimal size withina given environment. This overall process of regulation is known as thedensity dependent effect. Predation is an example of a density dependent reg-ulator. As the densityof a prey species rises, the hunting patterns of predators often changeso as to increase predation on that particular population of prey. Consequently, the prey population decreases; the predators then are left withless of a food resource and their density subsequently declines. The effectof this is often a series of density fluctuations until an equilib-rium is reachedbetween the predator and prey populations. Thus, in a stable predator-preysystem, the two populations are actually regulated by each other. Emigration of individuals from the parent population is another form ofdensity dependent control. As the population density increases, a larger numberof animals tend to move outward in search of new sources of food. Emigration is a distinctive behavior pattern acting to disperse part of theovercrowded population. Competition is also a density dependent control. As the population densityincreases, the competition for limited resources becomes more intense. Consequently, the deleterious results of unsuccessful competition suchas starvation and injury become more and more effective in limiting thepopulation size. Physiological as well as behavioral mechanisms have evolved that helpto regulate population growth. It has been observed that an increase inpopulation density is accompanied by a marked depression in inflammatoryresponse and antibody formation. This form of inhibited immuneresponse allows for an increase in susceptibility to infection and parasitism. Observation of laboratory mice has shown that as population densityincreases, aggressive behavior increases, reproduction rate falls, sexualmatu-rity is impaired, and the growth rate becomes suppressed.
