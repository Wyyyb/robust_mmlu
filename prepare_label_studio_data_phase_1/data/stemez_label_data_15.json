Therefore, since we are buying 300 pieces of lumber, we are buying 300 \u00d7 12 board feet, or 3,600 board feet. Since the lumber is sold in units of thousands of board feet, we must find out how many thousands of board feet we require. This is accomplished by dividing the total board feet (3,600) by 1,000, giving 3.6. So the cost of the lumber 3.6 thousand board feet X $140 per thousand board giving $504."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA super market has two cans of the same brand of tuna fish.

Substituting a maturity value of $549.64, an interest rate of 5% = .05 per year, and a term of [70 / (360)] of a year, we obtain Interest = $549.64 \u00d7 .05 \u00d7[70 / (360)]which rounds to $5.34. Also, a collection fee of (1/8)% = .00125 was charged. This can be calculated as follows: (1/8)% of $549.64 = .00125 \u00d7 $549.64, which rounds to $.69.

To do this we must find the revenue function and the cost function. The profit function is just the revenue function minus the cost function. (i) Revenue function. Let x be the number of 50 cent deductions. Then the selling price of the textbook is (15 - 0.5x). For example, when x = 4 there have been four 50 cent deductions or a $2 reduction, setting the selling price at $13. For every deduction, there will be an increase of 10 books sold so that the total number of books sold at price (15 - 0.5x) is (200 + 10x).

To do this, we first must find the linear cost and revenue functions. Let X stand for the number of books. The revenue is equal to the amount of revenue per book times the number of books. In function form this becomes: R = $1 X (R = revenue). The daily cost is equal to the variable cost times the number of books plus the daily fixed cost.

Company A will choose plan A_2 and Company B will choose plan B_3\nD. Company A will choose plan A_1 and Company B will choose plan B_4\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nEach land agent realizes that the other land agent will choose the best strategy for his company. Company A will want the highest number it can get from the matrix, while company B will try to get the smallest number from the matrix (recall that a negative number means that percent goes to company B). Since each land agent will not underestimate their opponent, they will assume that their opponent will make the best choices. Using \"pure strategy\", the agent for Company B will never choose plan B_4, because independent of Company A's choice, B_1's entries are smaller than B_4's. Similarly, Company A will never choose plan A_1, because independent of Company B's choice, A_3 has larger entries than A_1. Thus, in reality the matrix is reduced to: B_1 B_2 B_3 A_2 - 1 - 3 - 5 A_3 9 5 8 By looking at the above matrix, Company A will surely choose plan A_3 because independent of Company B's choice, the entries in A_3 are larger than those in A_2. Noting that, Company B will choose plan B_2 which is the minimum of the choices left to it. Thus, Company A will take 5% of Company B's business. This point (A_3, B_2) is called the \"saddle-point\". It is the point where both companies must operate, otherwise they will lose more in the long run, for the other company will choose a better strategy.

Company A will want the highest number it can get from the matrix, while company B will try to get the smallest number from the matrix (recall that a negative number means that percent goes to company B).

Thus, in reality the matrix is reduced to: B_1 B_2 B_3 A_2 - 1 - 3 - 5 A_3 9 5 8 By looking at the above matrix, Company A will surely choose plan A_3 because independent of Company B's choice, the entries in A_3 are larger than those in A_2.

This fixed percentage is usually taken to be twice the percentage that would be used if we used the straight- line method. Here, if we used the straight-line method, the depreciation allowance for each year would be the amount depreciated ($3,000) divided by the number of years (5), giving $600. Now the rate is found by dividing the depreciation allowance by the cost, giving 20% ($600 / $3,000 = .20 = 20%). Thus we will use 40% as the declining-balance rate.

Super-Cola will choose campaign 1 and Cola-Cola will choose counter-campaign 2\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nEach company wishes the strategy that is best for them. Super-Cola wishes to get the maximum amount of people from Cola-Cola, and Cola-Cola wishes to minimize their losses to Super-Cola. To do this, we use the minimax procedure. Super-Cola realizes that Cola-Cola will always look for the minimum losses, thus Super-Cola considers the minimum of what will happen for each choice of campaign. Super-Cola notices that the minimum gain for campaign 1 is 20,000 people, the minimum gain for campaign 2 is 10,000 people, but the minimum gain for campaign 3 is 50,000 people. Thus, Super-Cola will choose campaign 3 - the maximum of the minimums. Similarly Cola-Cola realizes that Super-Cola will want to choose the maximum for each of Cola-Cola's counter-campaigns. Thus; Cola-Cola only looks at the maximums. For counter-campaign 1 the maximum loss is 90,000 people, for counter-campaign 2 the maximum loss is 50,000 people, and for counter-campaign 3 the maximum loss is 80,000 people. Thus, Cola-Cola will choose counter-campaign 2 which is the minimum of the maximums. In this way they will minimize the losses. The point on the payoff matrix which they both choose is called the \"saddle point\". At this point neither company will change it's strategy for they are doing the best that they can. This type of a \"game\" is called a two-player zero-sum game, because whatever one player wins, the other player loses. Thus, the algebraic sum of the two is zero. Another way of looking at this problem is \"pure-strategy\". Super-Cola will look at the matrix and note that campaign 3 contains the largest numbers in each column. Thus, campaign 3 is the best choice regardless of which counter-campaign Cola-Cola chooses. Cola-Cola will notice this also. They will choose counter-campaign 2, for that one contains the minimum of all their choices, given Super-Cola will choose campaign 3.", "ref_id": 3168, "meta_info": {"subject": "business.csv", "src": "stemez-Business", "question": "A new soda company, Super-Cola/recently entered the market.

Super-Cola wishes to get the maximum amount of people from Cola-Cola, and Cola-Cola wishes to minimize their losses to Super-Cola. To do this, we use the minimax procedure. Super-Cola realizes that Cola-Cola will always look for the minimum losses, thus Super-Cola considers the minimum of what will happen for each choice of campaign. Super-Cola notices that the minimum gain for campaign 1 is 20,000 people, the minimum gain for campaign 2 is 10,000 people, but the minimum gain for campaign 3 is 50,000 people. Thus, Super-Cola will choose campaign 3 - the maximum of the minimums. Similarly Cola-Cola realizes that Super-Cola will want to choose the maximum for each of Cola-Cola's counter-campaigns. Thus; Cola-Cola only looks at the maximums. For counter-campaign 1 the maximum loss is 90,000 people, for counter-campaign 2 the maximum loss is 50,000 people, and for counter-campaign 3 the maximum loss is 80,000 people. Thus, Cola-Cola will choose counter-campaign 2 which is the minimum of the maximums. In this way they will minimize the losses. The point on the payoff matrix which they both choose is called the \"saddle point\". At this point neither company will change it's strategy for they are doing the best that they can. This type of a \"game\" is called a two-player zero-sum game, because whatever one player wins, the other player loses. Thus, the algebraic sum of the two is zero. Another way of looking at this problem is \"pure-strategy\". Super-Cola will look at the matrix and note that campaign 3 contains the largest numbers in each column. Thus, campaign 3 is the best choice regardless of which counter-campaign Cola-Cola chooses. Cola-Cola will notice this also. They will choose counter-campaign 2, for that one contains the minimum of all their choices, given Super-Cola will choose campaign 3."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nIn order to help finance his new home, Mr. Hendricks borrowed$5,000 from a bank under a fixed mortgage, agreeingto pay 5% interest yearly, in semiannual installmentswith the mortgage to fall due in twenty years.
