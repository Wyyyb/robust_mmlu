Since they are rigidly held, they cannot do so and therefore suffer a compressive stress. The forces in the two rods must be the same. If they were not, then at the interface between them, the forces would not balance, equi-librium would not exist, and the interface would move until the forces were equal. Young's Modulus Y = (Stress/St rain) ,where the stressis the where the stress is the normal force per unit (cross sectional) area acting at the end of the bar, and the strain is the fractional change of length\\Deltal l /lof a bar due to the of a bar due to the stress. If Y_B and Y_S are, respectively, Young'smodulii for brass and for for brass and for steel, then, since the stresses are equal Y_B (\\Deltal_B/l_B) = Y_S (\\Deltal_S/l_S) \\textbulletl_Bandl_S are the length of the brass and the steel, respectively, when no stress is applied.

The energy of an incident photon is entirely given up to one electron of the metal. If this is an interior electron, it will travel towards the surface of the metal and, in the process, loose energy due to collisions with atoms of the metal. In addition, the electrons will loose energy because they must overcome the attractive force of the atoms of the metal in order to escape from the surface. (The energy needed to overcome this attractive force is called the metal's work function, W). Electrons near the surface of the metal, however, don't experience the collisions de-scribed above, and they can't lose energy due to this cause. As a result, these surface electrons will be emitted with a higher kinetic energy than the interior electrons.

Just before colliding with the earth, the kinetic energy is a maximum. The conservation of energy requires that the increase in kinetic energy of the rock must equal the change in its potential energy, U - U_0 =mgh- mgh_0 = mg(h - h_0) Since h - h_0 = 0m - 10m, m = 5 kg, and g = 9.8 m/s^2 , the change in the potential energy is U - U_0 = (5 kg)(9.8m/s^2)(-10 m) = -4.9 \u00d7 10^2 J The minus sign means that the potential energy has decreased.

We know that the atomic mass of KC1 is equal to the sum of the atomic masses of K(35.1) andCl(39.1). Its value is then 74.6amu. Since 1amuis the gram mass of 1 mole of a substance, 1 mole of KC1 has a mass of 74.6 g or 74.6 \u00d7 10^-3 kg. If the density of KC1 is 1.99 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3, 1 mole of KC1 has a volume V = [(74.6 \u00d7 10^-3 kg) / (1.99 \u00d7 10^3 kg/m^3)] = 3.75 \u00d7 10^-5 m^3 Since there are 6 \u00d7 10^23 molecules in 1 mole, the volume v occupied by 1 molecule is v = [v / (6 \u00d7 10^23)] = [(3.75 \u00d7 10^-5 m^3) / (6 \u00d7 10^23)] v = 6.25 \u00d7 10^-29 m^3 . Each molecule of KC1 is composed of 2 atoms. The volume, v' per atom is Then v' = (v/2) = 3.13 \u00d7 10^-29 m^3 . If we assume each atom to be centered in a cube of side d, then v' = d^3 = 3.13 \u00d7 10^-29 m^3 or d = 3.150 \u00d7 10^-10 m Thus the linear separation of atoms, i.e., the separation of the principal planes, is d = 3.150 \u00d7 10^-10 m = 3.150 \\AA.

It is very important to realize that Newton's Laws only hold in inertial frames. If we want to analyze this experiment from the point of view of an observer in a non inertial frame, we must use a modified form of Newton's Second Law, Ma\"^\\ding{217} = F^\\ding{217} - F'^\\ding{217}(1) where a\"^\\ding{217} is the acceleration of M as observed in the non-inertial frame (the elevator) ,F^\\ding{217} is the sum of all real forces acting on M (i.e., tensions, gravity, etc.) and -F'^\\ding{217} is the sum of all fictitious forces. These latter forces arise because we are doing our experiment in a non--inertial frame. (Fictitious forces include Carioles forces, centrifugal forces, etc.) In this particular problem, a\"^\\ding{217} = 0 because the mass M is at rest in the elevator. F^\\ding{217}, the sum of the real forces acting on M, includes Mg, the weight of M, and N, the normal force exerted by the floor of the elevator on the mass. Hence, F = N - Mg(2) where the minus sign appears because N and Mg are in opposite directions. We may now substitute equation (2) into equation (1) and solve the latter for F'^\\ding{217} : 0 = F - F' F' = F F' = N - Mg(3) Now, - F', the fictitious force, is defined as - Ma'^\\ding{217}, where a'^\\ding{217} is the acceleration of the non-inertial frame with respect to the earth (-g\\^{y}in our case). Hence, - F' = Mg(4) Inserting this in (3), we find - Mg = N - Mg(5) N = 0(6) Hence, the floor exerts no force on M.

To find the energy values of theeigenstatesof hydrogen, consider theSchroedingerequation expressed in spherical co-ordinates . \\psi(r, \\texttheta, \\textphi) = R (r) y (\\texttheta, \\textphi). In general, the total energy of the hydrogen electron is due to its angular momentum (rotation with radius r), its linear momentum along the variable radius r, and its potential energy due only to its distance r from the nucleus. TheSchroedingerequation for the radial part R(r) of the wavefunctioncan be obtained at once as follows. The angu-lar momentum equals L =mvr. The rotational energy of the particle at radius r is (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)m[(L/mr)]^2 = (L^2/2mr^2). Rotational energy, the angular motion of the particle, is related to the y(\\texttheta, \\textphi) part of thewavefunction. The angular momentum of the electron in a stable state around the nucleus (energyeigenstate) is quantized as L^2 = l (l + 1)h^2l = 0,1,2,... Wherehis Planck's constant divided by 2\\pi. As far as the radial motion along r is concerned, the contribution of the rotational motion to the total energy of the particle, [{L(L + 1)h^2}/2mr^2] , depends only on the radial position r. Potential energy can be viewed as any energy which de-pends on a distance r and reduces to zero at infinite dis-tance. This permits us to consider the energy due to rota-tion as a form of potential energy. Hence, the one- dimensional radial motion takes place in an effective potential (important since it is expressed in terms of only one variable r). U (r) = [L(L + 1)h^2)/2m_er^2] + v (r)(1) where V(r) is the electrostatic potential. The radial part of theSchroedingerequation is given by - (h^2/2m_e) (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2 R') + U (r) R (r) = ER (r)(2) where E is the total energy (eigenvalue) corresponding to an orbit (eigenstate) of radius r and R' = [{dr(r)}/dr]. For the lowest energy states, let l equal zero. Also, for an electron a distance r from a nucleus of charge Ze, the potential energy is U (r) = [(-KZe^2)/r] = (-Ke^2/r)(3) where K is the Coulomb constant and Z = 1 for hydrogen. We therefore have (-h^2/2m_e) (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2R') - (Ke^2/r)R = ER.(4) Let\\lambda^2 = (-2m_eE/h^2).(5) We assume \\lambda^2 is positive since the energy E must be negative if the electron is bound to the nucleus. Multiplying (4) by \\lambda^2/E we have (1/r^2) (d/dr)(r^2R') + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = \\lambda^2R.(6) A solution of Eq. (6) has to approach zero as r approaches \\infty since the energy is zero at infinite distance. Rewriting the equation, R\\textquotedblright + [(2R/r) + {(2m_eKe^2)/h^2} (R/r)] = \\lambda^2R.(7) For large r, the terms in parentheses are insignificant and we have R\" = \\lambda^2R(8) which is satisfied by R \\approx e-\\lambdar(9) which goes to zero when r, the distance of the electron from the nucleus, is infinite. This solution will be true for all r if the terms in parentheses in (7) cancel each other. To find the value of \\lambda which makes this true, we set these terms equal to zero. (2R'/r) + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = 0. We know that R' = -\\lambdae^-\\lambdar= -\\lambdaR. Therefore we have (-2\\lambdaR/r) + [(2m_eKe^2)/h^2] (R/r) = 0(10) and \\lambda = [(m_eKe^2)/h^2] = (1/0.529 A)(11) sinceh^2/m_eKe2 \\approx 0.529 A is the Bohr radius.

The pressure at the bottom of the pond is P_b = P_t + (\\rhog)h where \\rho is the density of water, g = 32 ft/s^2, and h is the depth of point b relative to the surface of the pond (point t). Therefore, p_b = 1atm+ (62.4 lb/ft^3) (34 ft) p_b = 1atm+ 2121.6 lb/ft^2 Since 1 lb/ft^2 = 1/144 lb/in^2 2121.6 lb/ft^2 = (2121.6/144) lb/in^2 = 14.73 lb/in^2 Because 14.7 lb/in^2 = 1atm 2121.6 lb/ft^2 \\approx 1 atm. Hencep_b= 2 atmospheres (29.4 lb/in.^2) It follows thatV_t/V_b= 2/1"}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA 5000-cm^3 container holds 4.90 gm of a gas when the pressure is 75.0 cm Hg and the temperature is 50\\textdegree C.
