Thus determine T_end. Since P_end is still 1000 psia, determination of any other end property will give the desired temperature. The additional property to be determined is the internal energy (or, equivalently, the enthalpy). Begin by picking a system for analysis and applying the energy equation to the system and process (as shown in the figure). Several choices of systems are available for this problem. Choice of the tank, the valve, and their contents as the system will lead to the most direct solution of the problem. Now assume that potential and kinetic energy changes are negligible during the filling process. In addition, no mass leaves the system during the filling operation, so that the energy equation around the system can be written as: (h\\deltaM)_in + \\deltaQ - \\deltaW = d(Mu)_sys The filling operation is adiabatic, so that \\deltaQ = 0. In addition, since no shaft passes through the system boundaries, and the system boundaries are rigid and immobile, \\deltaW = 0 and the energy equation reduced to: h\\deltaM_in = d(Mu)_sys Now this result must be integrated over the entire filling operation: \\inth\\deltaM_in = \\intd(Mu)_sys h_in is the enthalpy of the air entering the system, in this case, the enthalpy of the air in the supply pipeline. Since the supply pipeline conditions do not change during the filling operation, h_in is constant and may be removed from under the integral of the left-hand side. The integral of \\deltaM_in is the total amount of mass which enters the tank. The integral of the right-hand side is the total change in (Mu_sys) during the process. h_in(M_in) = [(Mu)_end - (Mu)_begin]_sys or h_inM_in = [M_endu_end - M_beginu_begin]_sys M_in may be eliminated by means of the mass balance: M_in = M_end - M_begin Substitution into the energy balance then gives: h_in[M_end - M_begin]_sys = [M_endu_end - M_beginu_begin]_sys or M_end[h_in - u_end] = M_begin[h_in - u_begin](1) Equation (1) contains five distinct variables: M_end, M_begin, h_in, u_begin, and u_end. M_begin is already known. h_i and u_in can be evaluated from the known pressure and temperature of these materials. Thus equation (1) contains two unknowns, and more equations will have to be developed before determining the missing unknowns. Relate the final mass of air in the cylinder to the cylinder volume by means of the final specific volume: M_end = (v_tank / v_end)(2) Equation (2) however adds another variable u_end to the system of equations and there is still one more unknown than the number of equations. The final specific volume, in turn, may be related to the final temperature and (known) pressure by means of the ideal-gas equation of state: v_end = [{RT_end} / {P_end(mol wt)}](3) Although equation (3) adds a fourth unknown, T_end, to our system of equations, the closing equation is now obtained by using the law which states that the specific internal energy of a gas which obeys the ideal-gas equation of state is a function only of the gas's temperature: u_end = f(T_end)(4) Since equation (4) adds no new unknowns, our system of equations is now complete. There are four equations with four unknowns. However, before solving these equations, develop the functional form indicated in equation (4): The constant-volume heat capacity C_v is defined by: C_v = (\\partialu / \\partialT)_v As indicated, however, the constant-volume restriction is unnecessary for a gas which obeys the ideal-gas equation of state.

A simple direct solution of equations (8) through (11) cannot be used. Therefore reduce the system of equations to a single nonlinear equation in T_end and this equation can be solved by appropriate means. Eliminate M_end between equations (8) and (9) [{(1213 Btu/lb_m - u_end)ft^3} / v_end] = 296 Btu(12) v_end is now eliminated between (12) and (10) [{(1213 Btu/lb_m - u_end)ft^3} / {3.70 \u00d7 10^-4 T_endft^3/(lb_m\\textdegreeR)}] = 296 Btu or (1213 Btu/lb_m - u_end) = 1.09 \u00d7 10^-1T_end (Btu / lb_m\\textdegreeR)(13) u_end is then eliminated between (13) and (11) to give a single equation in T_end.

The final expression for T_B must contain only a, b, and R.\n\nOptions:\nA. T_B = (a / bR)\nB. T_B = (aR / b)\nC.             T_B = (a / b)\nD. T_B = (b / aR)\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nIt is not easy to rearrange the van der Waals equation into the virial form, which would allow T_B to be evaluated by inspection. Therefore, the van der Waals equation to be used is P = [(nRT) / (V - nb)] - [(n^2a) / V^2](1) where P = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, T = temperature and R = gas constant. Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by V gives PV = nRT[V / (V - nb)] [(n^2a) / V^2](2) Differentiating equation (2) partially with respect to P, keeping T constant, gives [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T = [{(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2}](\\partialV / \\partialP)_T(3) At P = 0, [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T = 0. Therefore, [{(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2}] (\\partialV / \\partialP)_T = 0(4) Under all conditions (\\partialV / \\partialP)_T < 0; therefore, the expression in square brackets in equation (4) must equal to zero. That is {(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2} = 0(5) Multiplying equation (5) through by V^2(V - nb)^2 gives nRTV^2(V - nb) - nRTV^3 + n^2a(V - nb)^2 = 0 or nRTV^2(V - nb) - nRTV^3 = - n^2a(V - nb)^2. Therefore, RT= (a / b) [(V - nb) / V]^2 = (a / b)[(V / V) - (nb / V)]^2 = (a / b) [1 - (nb / V)]^2(6) At the Boyle point T = T_B, P = 0 and V = \\infty, so RT_B = (a / b) or T_B = (a / Rb). Another method of doing this is to set (n / V) = c. So, the van der Waals equation of state becomes P = [(cRT) / (1 - bc)] - ac^2(7) From equation (7), PV = n [{(RT) / (1 - bc)} - ac](8) Using the chain rule to differentiate equation (8) partially with respect to P gives [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T= [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialc]_T (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = n [{(bRT) / [(1 - bc)^2]} - a](\\partialc / \\partialP)_T(9) Observe that (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = [1 / {(\\partialc / \\partialP)_T}] = (\\partialP / \\partialC)_T ^-1.

The final expression for T_B must contain only a, b, and R.", "options": ["T_B = (a / bR)", "T_B = (aR / b)", "T_B = (a / b)", "T_B = (b / aR)"], "answer": "A", "solution": "It is not easy to rearrange the van der Waals equation into the virial form, which would allow T_B to be evaluated by inspection. Therefore, the van der Waals equation to be used is P = [(nRT) / (V - nb)] - [(n^2a) / V^2](1) where P = pressure, V = volume, n = number of moles, T = temperature and R = gas constant. Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by V gives PV = nRT[V / (V - nb)] [(n^2a) / V^2](2) Differentiating equation (2) partially with respect to P, keeping T constant, gives [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T = [{(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2}](\\partialV / \\partialP)_T(3) At P = 0, [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T = 0. Therefore, [{(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2}] (\\partialV / \\partialP)_T = 0(4) Under all conditions (\\partialV / \\partialP)_T < 0; therefore, the expression in square brackets in equation (4) must equal to zero. That is {(nRT) / (V - nb)} - {(nRTV) / [(V - nb)]^2} + {(n^2a) / V^2} = 0(5) Multiplying equation (5) through by V^2(V - nb)^2 gives nRTV^2(V - nb) - nRTV^3 + n^2a(V - nb)^2 = 0 or nRTV^2(V - nb) - nRTV^3 = - n^2a(V - nb)^2. Therefore, RT= (a / b) [(V - nb) / V]^2 = (a / b)[(V / V) - (nb / V)]^2 = (a / b) [1 - (nb / V)]^2(6) At the Boyle point T = T_B, P = 0 and V = \\infty, so RT_B = (a / b) or T_B = (a / Rb). Another method of doing this is to set (n / V) = c. So, the van der Waals equation of state becomes P = [(cRT) / (1 - bc)] - ac^2(7) From equation (7), PV = n [{(RT) / (1 - bc)} - ac](8) Using the chain rule to differentiate equation (8) partially with respect to P gives [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialP]_T= [{\\partial(PV)} / \\partialc]_T (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = n [{(bRT) / [(1 - bc)^2]} - a](\\partialc / \\partialP)_T(9) Observe that (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = [1 / {(\\partialc / \\partialP)_T}] = (\\partialP / \\partialC)_T ^-1. From equation (7), (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = [{(bcRT) / [(1 - bc)^2]} + {(RT) / (1 - bc)} - 2ac]^-1(10) Observe that equation (10) reduces to RT as P \\rightarrow 0 and c \\rightarrow 0 or (\\partialc / \\partialP)_T = (1 / RT). Since (1 / RT) \\not = 0 and n \\not = 0, the term in the square brackets in equation (9) must vanish at c = 0 and T = T_B.

Since N_P, a, c and T (T = max. temp.) are unknown, three more equations mustbe written. For the CO reaction, CO + (1/2)O_2\\rightarrow CO_2, K_CO = [(p_(_CO)2) / {(p_CO) / (p_(O)2)^(1/2)}], the second equation. For the CO_2, H_2 reaction, called the water gas reaction, CO_2 + H_2 \\rightarrow H_2O + CO, K_wg= [{(p_(_H)2(O)) (p_CO)} / {(p_C_(O)2) (p_(H)2)}], the third equation. Taking p as the total pressure at equilibrium and noting that at the beginningof combustion p_1V = N_RRT_1anat the end of combustion pV=N_PRT, p_CO= [(1 - a) / N_P] p = (1 - a) [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)], p_(_O)2= [(3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c] [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)], and p_C_(_O)2= [(ap_1T) / (N_RT_1)] atT,K_CO= [{(ap_1T) / (N_RT_1)} / {(1 - a) [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)] \\surd[((3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c) {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}] = [a / (1 - a)]\\surd[(N_RT_1) / {((3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c) p_1T}] p_(_H)2(O)= [(2cp_1T) / (N_RT_1)] p_(_H)2= [{2(1 - a) p_1T} / (N_RT_1)] K_wg= [{[2c {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}] [(1 - a) {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}]} / {(a {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}) [{2(1 - a) p_1T} / (N_RT_1)]}] = [{c(1 - a)} / {a(1 - c)}]. Now the energy balance must be used. The energy given off by combustionis equal to the energy absorbed by the products. Therefore, thefourth necessary equation is \\sumN_p(U_p _final - U_p initial) =H_C(_H)4 - N_COH_CO - N_(H)2H_(H)2. This equation is based upon combustion taking place at the initial conditions; the products absorb the energy liberated, causing their temperatureto increase from the initial to the final temperature, which is themaximum temperature of combustion. The equilibrium energy and the number of moles present depend on the temperature. However, there are four equations and four unknowns (N_p, a, c and T).Hence, they can be evaluated.

Since N_P, a, c and T (T = max. temp.) are unknown, three more equations mustbe written. For the CO reaction, CO + (1/2)O_2\\rightarrow CO_2, K_CO = [(p_(_CO)2) / {(p_CO) / (p_(O)2)^(1/2)}], the second equation. For the CO_2, H_2 reaction, called the water gas reaction, CO_2 + H_2 \\rightarrow H_2O + CO, K_wg= [{(p_(_H)2(O)) (p_CO)} / {(p_C_(O)2) (p_(H)2)}], the third equation. Taking p as the total pressure at equilibrium and noting that at the beginningof combustion p_1V = N_RRT_1anat the end of combustion pV=N_PRT, p_CO= [(1 - a) / N_P] p = (1 - a) [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)], p_(_O)2= [(3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c] [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)], and p_C_(_O)2= [(ap_1T) / (N_RT_1)] atT,K_CO= [{(ap_1T) / (N_RT_1)} / {(1 - a) [(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)] \\surd[((3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c) {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}] = [a / (1 - a)]\\surd[(N_RT_1) / {((3 / 2) - (a / 2) - c) p_1T}] p_(_H)2(O)= [(2cp_1T) / (N_RT_1)] p_(_H)2= [{2(1 - a) p_1T} / (N_RT_1)] K_wg= [{[2c {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}] [(1 - a) {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}]} / {(a {(p_1T) / (N_RT_1)}) [{2(1 - a) p_1T} / (N_RT_1)]}] = [{c(1 - a)} / {a(1 - c)}]. Now the energy balance must be used. The energy given off by combustionis equal to the energy absorbed by the products. Therefore, thefourth necessary equation is \\sumN_p(U_p _final - U_p initial) =H_C(_H)4 - N_COH_CO - N_(H)2H_(H)2. This equation is based upon combustion taking place at the initial conditions; the products absorb the energy liberated, causing their temperatureto increase from the initial to the final temperature, which is themaximum temperature of combustion. The equilibrium energy and the number of moles present depend on the temperature. However, there are four equations and four unknowns (N_p, a, c and T).Hence, they can be evaluated. From the combustion equation CH_4 + 2O_2 + 7.56N_2 \\rightarrow aCO_2 + (1 - a)CO + 2cH_2O + 2(1 - c)H_2+ [(3 / 2) - (a / 2) -c] O_2 + 7.56N_2 theenergy equation can be written, a(U_2^C(O)2 - U_1^C(O)2) + (1 - a) (U_2^CO - U_1^CO) + 2c (U_2^(H)2(O) - U_1^(H)2(O)) + 2(1 - c) (U_2^(^H)2 - U_1^(H)2) + [(3 / 2) - (a / 2) -c] (U_2^(O)2 - U_1^(O)2) + 7.56 (U_2^(^N)2 - U_1^(N)2) = H_C(H)4 - (1 - a) H_CO - 2(1 - c) H_(H)2 or a(U_2^C(O)2 - U_1^C(O)2) + (1 - a) (U_2^CO - U_1^CO) + 2c (U_2^(H)2(O) - U_1^(H)2(O)) + 2(1 - c) (U_2^(^H)2 - U_1^(H)2) + [(3 / 2) - (a / 2) -c] (U_2^(O)2 - U_1^(O)2) + 7.56U_2^(N)2 = H_C(H)4 - H_CO - H_(H)2 +aH_CO+ 2cH_(H)2 + 7.56U_1^(N)2.

Now, for laminar flow, theNusseltnumber is found as Nu_L= 0.664Re_L^(^1/2) Pr^(1/3) wherethe subscript L refers to the length of the laminar boundary layer. The condition 0.6 \\leq Pr \\leq 50 issatisfied. Then Nu_L= 0.664(5 \u00d7 10^5)^(^1/2) (0.701)^(1/3) = 417.09 Then the heat transfer coefficient in the laminar region is found using eq.(3). h_Lam= (Nu_Lamk/L_cr) = [{(417.09)(0.01995)} / 1.021] = 8.15 Btu/hr-ft^2-\\textdegreeF. Finally, the heat transfer out of the laminar region is q_Lam=h_LamA_Lam(T_s - T_\\infty) = (8.15)(1)(0.817)(500 - 100) = 2,663.3 Btu/hr. (b) Referring to eq.(1), the heat transferred from the turbulent boundary layerregion is easily found as q_turb=q_T-q_Lam= 10,104 - 2,663.3 = 7440.7 Btu/hr (c) If the boundary layer is turbulent from the leading edge on theNusellt numberis given by Nu_L= 0.037Re_L^0.8Pr^(^1/3) Substituting, Nu_L= 0.037(9.8 \u00d7 10^5)^0.8 (0.701)^(^1/3) = 2040.6 The heat transfer coefficient is then h_L= (Nu_Lk/ L) = [{(2040.6)(0.01995)} / 2] = 20.36 Btu/hr-ft^2-\\textdegreeF Therefore, the total heat transferred q_T= (20.36)(2 \u00d7 1)(500 - 100) = 16,288 Btu/hr (d) The difference between the two values of the total heat transfer may beexpressed as a percent error: % error = [(16,288 - 10,104) / (10,104)] \u00d7 100% \\approx 61% The overall turbulence assumed results in erroneous results and hence is tobe avoided."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nCarbon dioxide decomposes into carbon monoxide and oxygenby the following reaction: CO_2 \\rightleftharpoons CO + (1/2)O_2.

For the two blocks to attain the same final temperature, when the two blocks are brought into thermal communication heat is going to be rejected from the hotter to the colder block.
