Since the angular frequency, \\omega, is given by \\omega = (2\\pi / T) , then \\omega is the same for each wave. The phase difference between each successive pair can be represented by \\textphi.

This result is easy to interpret physically; any two waves of equal frequency and amplitude will interfere destructively (that is, cancel each other with a resultant amplitude = 0) when their phase difference is 180\\textdegree (the crest of one wave corresponds exactly to the trough of the other) . Thus, any even number of waves with equal amplitude and frequency will have a resultant amplitude of zero. Since this is a very general solution that holds for any even number of waves, let us proceed to try to find a more specific solution which holds for the given case; that is, for six waves.

When glass is subject to great strain, however, it becomes doubly refracting. A convenient test of the presence of such strains is found, therefore, by placing the specimen between a crossed analyzer and polarizer. If the glass has strains, it is doubly refracting, two beams are transmitted, and the strains are rendered evident by the appearance of interference colors.

Although, as far as extinction of transmitted light goes, the final result is the same as if there were no quarter-wave plates, this combination has the very great advantage that, if after this preliminary adjustment has been made, the combination of the analyzer and its quarter-wave plate is rotated, there is still no light transmitted for any position.

If it picks up 15,000 lb of water in 400 yd, determine the exact force and horsepower required.\n\nOptions:\nA. 3025lbw and 484 hp\nB. 2500lbw and 400 hp\nC.             3500lbw and 550 hp\nD. 2750lbw and 500 hp\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe speed of the engine is 60 mph or 88 ft /sec. It goes 400 yd in (400 \u00d7 3)/88 sec so that the time rate of picking up water is (15,000 \u00d7 88)/(400 \u00d7 3) = 1100lbw/sec. The force F which the engine must exert to pick up this water is given by Newton's second law as F = [{d(mv)} /dt] =v(dm /dt) = [v dm /gdt] = (88 / 32) \u00d7 1100 = 3025lbw since the velocity v is constant. The additional horse-power which the engine must develop to maintain its con-stant speed and pick up the water is equal to the force exerted times the velocity. The conversion factor from ft-lb/sec to horsepower is 550 ft-lb/sec = 1 hp. The additional power required is then (Fv / 550) = [(3025 \u00d7 88) / 550] = 484 hp. Now, it might be thought that the additional force neces-sary could be found from the relationship between the work done by the force F and the increase in kinetic energy of the water. An amount of kinetic energy K.E = (1/2)(w/g)v^2 = (1/2) \u00d7 (15000 / 32) \u00d7 88 \u00d7 88 = 1.815 \u00d7 10^6 ft.lbw is picked up in a distance of 1200 ft, so the force re-quired for this is F = [(1.815\u00d7 10^6) / 1200] = 1512.5lbw. This is exactly half the value obtained by using the rate of change of momentum. The discrepancy lies in the fact that the engine has done more work than that required to give the water kinetic energy. Some energy goes into heat and is exactly equal to the kinetic energy received. Thus, the total amount of energy received by the water in the 400 yd is double that given by the kinetic energy, or 3.63 \u00d7 10^6 ftlbw.
