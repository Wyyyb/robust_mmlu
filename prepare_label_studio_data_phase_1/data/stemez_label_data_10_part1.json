The serial anticipation method is the typical method employed in paired-associate task experiments. In this method, the first item of the pair is presented alone, followed by both items of the pair presented together.

Paired-associate tasks are often considered easier than serial tasks because half of the items do not have to be anticipated; they merely serve as cues to signal the other half of the items. Also, in the paired-associate task, an item of the pair serves only one function: stimulus or response. In the serial task sequence, the middle item of A-B-C (\"B\") serves two functions.

The paired-associate task also allows us to look at the learning of a pair independently of its position in the list, unlike serial tasks. Another reason why psychologists favor paired-associate learning is that its experimental method is similar to nonverbal learning and conditioning experiments. For example, the left-hand item of the pair serves as a stimulus that, evokes a response (the right hand item). The subjects' response is reinforced by the appearance of the complete pair.

The complexity of the tasks determines positive or negative transfer\nC.             The type of transfer is determined by the difficulty level of the tasks\nD. The duration of the tasks affects the type of transfer\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe degree of similarity of the stimuli and responses in two tasks is one of the most important variables determining whether transfer will be positive or negative. To investigate this variable, Bruce (1933) used paired-associate learning in his famous transfer experiment which has since been replicated by others. Bruce constructed lists of paired-associate stimulus-response items for two tasks. The condition of the paired-associate lists varied. In one experimental condition, the stimuli of tasks one and two were different, but the responses were identical. In another, the stimuli were identical but the responses were dissimilar. In other conditions, either the stimuli or responses in Task 2 were similar to those in Task 1. The results of this study show that very strong positive transfer results when the stimuli are similar and the responses are identical. In other words, the more that previous and future learning are similar, the more likely it is that positive transfer will result. In verbal learning, there is some positive transfer even when the stimuli are dissimilar but the response is the same. In general, the more similar the stimuli, the more likely it will be that positive transfer will occur. Positive transfer may also increase with the amount of similarity between responses in the original and new situation. For example, although the games of tennis and badminton are different, they require similar responses and skills which make learning easier. If, however, two responses are extremely dissimilar, negative transfer will result. For example, airplane accidents occasionally occur because a pilot will transfer a response he made on similar controls on a plane he flew previously to those of a new plane. Although the controls (stimulus) are similar, they require different responses. An accident created in this way is the result of negative transfer. In summary, some major points concerning stimulus-response similarity found in these experiments are: 1. Learning to make identical responses to new stimuli results in positive transfer. 2. Learning to make new (dissimilar, opposite or antagonistic) responses to similar or identical stimuli results in negative transfer. 3. The amount of transfer, regardless of whether it is positive or negative, is a function of stimulus similarity. 4. Whether transfer is positive or negative is largely dependent upon response similarity.",

Personality has no impact on test scores\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIntelligence is most often measured through IQ tests and performance on IQ tests is influenced by achievement drive (or achievement motivation according to Atkinson), persistence, value system, emotional stability, and other characteristics that are part of the psychological construct, \"personality\". In the evaluation and understanding of the results of an intelligence test it is necessary to consider the influence of personality variables. Thus, in order to determine if an IQ score will accurately predict an individual 's future academic achievement and intellectual development it is necessary to know if the individual's IQ score truly reflects his potential or his current intellectual development and academic achievement. If a child is \"depressive\" and therefore is poorly motivated then his performance on the IQ test may be impaired. The resultant IQ score may not reflect his true ability. The depressed child is often \"uncooperative\" in test situations. Similarly, an individual may not place any value on academic achievement or intelligence and therefore may not take the IQ test seriously. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the IQ score in measuring intelligence, the examiner must know the effects of intervening personality variables. The IQ score may deflate or even inflate the true extent of an individual's true intelligence. Moreover, even if the IQ score is accurate, an individual's personality may affect his future behavior in such a way as to prevent the accurate prediction of academic achievement based on the IQ score (the IQ score is usually used for the purposes of prediction). For example, in certain ethnic groups academic achievement is valued highly and therefore an individual belonging to that ethnic group may score near the mean on an IQ test but then perform above average in future academic achievement. Personality variables will always affect test behavior. So, even though there may not be a direct relation between intelligence and personality, it is almost certainly the case that personality affects test-taking behavior and therefore resultant scores may not be \"accurate.\" It is not the same to say that depressive people are less intelligent as it is to say that depressive people often receive lower intelligence test scores. One important relationship between personality and intelligence is the effect of high intelligence or high IQ on personality. More intelligent individuals tend to be more successful and success positively affects emotional adjustment, interpersonal relations, and self-concept. However, it is possible that only those intelligent people who are emotionally well adjusted, have a high self-concept, and who have good interpersonal relations are successful. It may not be possible to determine cause and effect in this case. The true relationship between intelligence and personality is uncertain.

The filter-amplitude theory implies that attention completely blocks out unattended information.\nD. The filter-amplitude theory suggests that attention works like a filter that attenuates rather than rejects information, allowing certain types of unattended information into the processing system.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nExperimenting with selective listening, Broadbent suggested that attention works like a filter that rejects certain input and passes other input along for further processing. The hypothetical filter mechanism can be tuned to any one or number of sensory channels (or types of sensory impressions). It only passes information on for further cognitive processing from channels to which it is specifically tuned. Only information that has passed through the filter can subsequently affect the subject's response or enter into memory. At first, this filter theory seems to fit the data from selective attention experiments, however, further experimentation has produced some difficulties for the theory. When subjects were asked to perform a shadowing exercise, (repeat a list of words presented to one ear, while other information is presented to the other ear), it was discovered that the rejected messages from the unattended ear did enter the subject's attention. This was especially true if the unattended message contained the subject's own name or if the message presented to the unattented ear included information that would contextually be expected in the message receiving the focus of attention. For example, if the information presented to the ear from which the shadowing was taking place was: \"Looking at the large birch/astronomic figures. . .\" while that from the unattended side was simultaneously: \"They could not believe/tree in the corner,\" the word \"tree\" was heard even though it came through the unattended side because the subject was expecting it due to the context. One may always be set for one's own name just as one is set for a particular input that corresponds to the context presented. Whatever the theoretical explanation for these interesting findings, it was necessary to modify the filter theory to include them. Treismanoffered the suggestion that the filter mechanism \"attenuates\" rather than rejects information. That is, the information that comes through the filter is weakened but remains strong enough to be picked up by other cognitive systems that are especially tuned to hear it. This filter-amplitude theory accounts for the introduction of certain types of unattended information into the processing system.",

When subjects were asked to perform a shadowing exercise, (repeat a list of words presented to one ear, while other information is presented to the other ear), it was discovered that the rejected messages from the unattended ear did enter the subject's attention. This was especially true if the unattended message contained the subject's own name or if the message presented to the unattented ear included information that would contextually be expected in the message receiving the focus of attention. For example, if the information presented to the ear from which the shadowing was taking place was: \"Looking at the large birch/astronomic figures. . .\" while that from the unattended side was simultaneously: \"They could not believe/tree in the corner,\" the word \"tree\" was heard even though it came through the unattended side because the subject was expecting it due to the context. One may always be set for one's own name just as one is set for a particular input that corresponds to the context presented. Whatever the theoretical explanation for these interesting findings, it was necessary to modify the filter theory to include them. Treismanoffered the suggestion that the filter mechanism \"attenuates\" rather than rejects information. That is, the information that comes through the filter is weakened but remains strong enough to be picked up by other cognitive systems that are especially tuned to hear it. This filter-amplitude theory accounts for the introduction of certain types of unattended information into the processing system."

Frequency and intensity have no relation to pitch or loudness\nD. Frequency is related to pitch and intensity is related to loudness\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nWe can distinguish between two tones when they differ with respect to certain variables. One such variable is loudness; one tone may be louder than the other. Another such variable is pitch. Different notes on the piano, for example, may be played equally loud. We would probably still be able to distinguish between them though each note's pitch is different. Our experiences of pitch and loudness are related to physical aspects of the actual stimulus. For instance, pitch is closely related to the 'frequency' of the stimulus. Sound is basically vibrations of particles in the air. These vibrations are wavelike and are called sound waves. They go up, down, up again, etc. The frequency of a vibration is a measure of how many times it goes up and down in a single period of time, usually a second. If a stimulus goes up and down many times in a second, we say it is a high frequency wave. We generally experience high frequency waves as high-pitched tones. Waves with low frequencies correspond to low-pitched tones. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is closely related to the intensity of the physical stimulus. Intensity is a measure of the amount of physical energy a stimulus sends to our senses. A high intensity sound sends a great deal of energy to our ear. We experience a high intensity sound as being \"loud.\" Similarly, a low intensity stimulus is perceived as \"soft.\" However, loudness is not directly related to intensity. Pitch is also not directly related to frequency. Other variables may participate in determining the loudness or pitch of a tone. For example, the intensity of a sound is also important in determining pitch. Increasing the intensity of a sound will often increase its pitch. Frequency may also play a part in determining loudness. In summary, frequency is very important in determining pitch. Intensity is closely related to experienced loudness.

That is, he does not pronounce each word silently to store it in verbal memory. Most adults read word for word only when the material is very difficult or when the print is hard to see. Even words of a well-learned phrase cannot be inwardly repeated more rapidly than at the rate of 600 per minute. The reading rate of many people is more rapid than 600 words per minute. One explanation of this phenomenon is the \"redundancy\" of the English language. It has been observed that English readers can fill-in missing letters and phrases in the language with remarkable accuracy. This is the \"redundancy effect.\" Some have estimated the redundancy of the language at 50 percent. This redundancy is thought to supplement what the reader sees with information from past experience so that the meaning can be correctly inferred without having to actually process each word. Because some readers can read more rapidly than even 1200 words per minute this explanation has been questioned as inaccurate or at least incomplete. It is possible to make an analogy between the recognition of words (without having to give attention to individual letters) and the reading of sentences (without processing each individual word). However, there is a higher process involved in the grasping of the meaning of a phrase that is not necessary for the identification and labeling of a single word.

Thus there are different intensities of sweetness. This applies to other tastes as well. Three major factors influence the intensity of a taste. These are the concentration of the stimulus, the area of the tongue's surface that is stimulated, and other tastes present at the same time. A glass of salt and water which contains only a pinch of salt will not taste very salty. However, one which contains much salt will taste quite salty. The second glass contains a more 'concentrated' mixture. This means it contains more salt in the same amount of liquid. The above salt solutions show that concentration affects the intensity of a taste. The higher the concentration, generally, the more intense is the taste experienced. Another variable factor is the amount of tongue that is in contact with the stimulus. This can also affect the intensity of a taste. In general, the larger the area of tongue that is stimulated, the more intense is the taste. In addition, a process called 'contrast' can affect taste intensity. Two different parts of the tongue may be stimulated by two different tastes at the same time. For example, one can put a weak sugar and water mixture on one side of one's tongue, and a weak salt water mixture on the other. You will find that the salt mixture tastes more intense than it normally would. That is, if the sugar mixture were not there, the salt mixture would not have tasted as salty. We see that we can increase the sensitivity to taste of part of our tongue. This can be done by stimulating another part of our tongue with a different taste.

Retroactive interference is the effect of new information on the recall of previously learned information\nD. Proactive interference is the effect of future learned items on the retention of information\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nIn studying the nature of retention and recall of information, one experiment presents three items to a subject and then distracts his attention for a brief period of time. After the first trial, retention is nearly perfect, but on subsequent trials recall deteriorates. It is thought that this occurs because the items that were stored in previous trials begin to confuse or interfere with the items from the current trial. This effect of prior learned items on the retention of information is called \"proactive interference.\" The type of item that is presented before a particular item also influences recall. This points strongly to the importance of classification in retention. If, for example, letters are presented for a number of trials and then numbers are presented, the numbers will be recalled with a high level of accuracy for the first few trials. This indicates that the memory of the letters does not interfere with the retention of the numbers and thus that they are likely to be stored in different parts of memory. This tendency for recall to improve when a change in category is made is called \"release from proactive interference.\" Interestingly, some of the categorical changes that produce release from proactive interference are not even noticed by the subjects. This may imply that items are stored in temporal order and that the difference in types of lists is used as a way to avoid confusion so that there is no interfering effect from a letter list when a number list is presented. One explanation for these findings is that different parts of memory handle different types of information and that temporal order is important. Whichever explanation is finally accepted, those findings are important to any theory about the development of memory structures (connected pieces of information which associatively give rise to one another). A study by Funkhouser showed further how classification at input affects retention. Subjects were shown pictures of simple objects such as chairs and trucks. The subjects were divided into groups. One group was asked to classify the objects by color, another by shape, and a third group was asked to make no classification. When this was completed, a brief distracting task was presented after which the subjects were asked to recall the items they had previously been shown. Some subjects were asked to recall using the same categories by which they had taken in the information; others were asked to recall using different categories. The speed and accuracy of recall for subjects who were permitted to recall using the same categories were far superior to that of the subjects who had to use different categories. This indicates that the classification that is made at the time of input of the material has a restricting influence on the way in which the material can be readily used. It is most accessible if it is associated with the same category; recall of the material becomes slow and laborious if it is needed in a different classification system. The term \"retroactive interference\" refers to the effect the last items learned have on the retention of information. Researchers have shown that the last few items learned tend to interfere with the earlier items. Thus, if the effects of proactive and retroactive interference are real, then the items in the middle of a long list should be the least likely to be recalled. This should be true because these items are subject to both proactive and retroactive interference. Experiments on memory have illustrated that this is exactly what happens when a subject is asked to recall a long list: the items at the beginning and at the end have a higher frequency of recall than those in the middle.",

A distinction is needed between active vocabulary and passive vocabulary. Active vocabulary refers to all the words the infant both understands and pronounces. Passive vocabulary includes the words he understands but cannot use when he speaks. When measuring a child's vocabulary acquisition, most psychologists measure the passive vocabulary. To record a child's progress, a researcher might use a normative table. The table would show the age of a child in one column and the average number of words acquired for each respective age in the next column. The problem with normative tables, however, is that they attempt to reflect a child's passive vocabulary, an element that is very difficult to pinpoint. The actual number of words a child knows and understands at a particular time is almost impossible to determine. Yet many researchers have produced tables which they believe to be accurate estimates. One of the best known normative tables for assessing language acquisition was constructed by M. E. Smith (1926). Smith based his findings on both active and passive vocabulary. He reported, for example, that a child knows one word by 10 months of age, three words by 12 months, 22 words by 18 months, and 272 words by his second birthday. Smith traced language acquisition up to 6 years of age; he reported that at this stage the child has acquired an average of 2,562 words in his vocabulary (passive and active). Several studies have been performed that use active vocabulary as the sole basis of measurement. These, however, underestimate the child's actual vocabulary. A second approach in the study of language acquisition is to examine the quality of the acquired language rather than measuring the size of the child's vocabulary.Landreth(1967) believes that linguists (language researchers) see the child not only as a developing being whose language acquisition can be measured but also as a guide who helps them understand the workings of language.",

            "text": "Question:\nIs the IQ a stable measure of intelligence ?\n\nOptions:\nA. The IQ is highly unstable.\nB. The IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence.\nC.             IQ has no relation with intelligence.\nD. The IQ is a measure of emotional stability.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nStability of IQ refers to the consistency of 2 or more IQ scores for one individual. There are two significant variables to be considered in the question of IQ stability. These are the interval between the initial test and the retest and the age of the individual. The shorter the interval between test and retest, the more stable the IQ. The age of the individual in question is important because the older the person is at the time of the initial IQ test, the more accurate will that IQ score be. Intelligence continues to change both qualitatively and quantitatively during development and the greatest changes occur early in development. Therefore, the difference in intelligence between a 3 - year-old and a 4 - year-old is greater than between a 14 year old and a 15 year old. In general the IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence. In a Swedish study,Husen(1951) found a correlation of .72 between the best scores of 613 3rd grade boys and the test scores of the same individuals ten years later. TheFelsResearch Institute (Sontag, Baker, & Nelson, 1958) conducted a study and found a correlation of .83 between the Stanford-Binetscores of the same individuals at three and four years of age. At age 12 the scores had a correlation of .46 with the scores from age 3.Bradway, Thompson, and Cravens (1958) conducted a study and found that initial IQ's had a correlation of. 65 with 10 - year retests and .59 with 25 - year retests. It should be noted that the stability of the IQ is effectively the same as its reliability. Despite whatever faults the IQ tests may have, they do have impressive reliabilities. One explanation for the increasing stability of the IQ with age is provided by the cumulative nature of intellectual development. An individual's intellectual skills at any one age include all the skills and knowledge acquired at an earlier age plus all newly acquired skills and knowledge. Predictions of IQ from age 10 to 16 would thus be more accurate than from 3 to 9, because scores at 10 represent more than half of the skills present at age 16 whereas scores at age 3 include a much smaller proportion of the skills and knowledge present at age 9. J. E. Anderson refers to the phenomenon of the increasingly close relationship between IQ scores at different ages as age increases as the 'overlap hypothesis'. Prerequisite learning skills also contribute significantly to the general stability of the IQ because they play an important role in subsequent learning. The more progress a child has made in the acquisition of intellectual skills and knowledge the better will he profit from subsequent learning experiences and the more stable his IQ. One reason behind childhood intervention programs (e.g.,Headstart) is that they help to provide children with prerequisite learning skills. Environmental stability, i.e. whatever intellectual advantages or disadvantages that an individual had at one stage in his development tend to persist, also accounts for the stability of IQ between tests. However, when there is a large upward or downward shift in the IQ it is usually attributable to a major environmental change. These IQ changes mean, of course, that the child is developing at a faster or a slower rate than that of the normative population on which the test was standardized. Drastic changes in family structure (divorce, loss of parents), adoption into a foster home, and severe or prolonged illness all have negative effects on a child's intellectual development. In general, children from culturally disadvantaged environments tend to experience a downward shift in IQ whereas children from culturally enriched environments experienced a relative gain in IQ. Parental concern with a child's educational achievement and with his general welfare is quite important in accounting for shifts in IQ. Without parental concern, children are unmotivated to achieve and to acquire intellectual skills and knowledge. During the preschool years, emotional dependency on parents seems to have a negative effect on intellectual development and seems to be the principal condition associated with IQ loss. During the school years, IQ gains are associated with high achievement drive, competitive striving, and curiosity about nature, that is, those attributes which are characteristic of an independent child. All of the above traits, including emotional dependency, can probably be attributed to parental attitudes and child-rearing practices. Emotional stability in general tends to have a beneficial effect on IQ. One study showed that accelerators (people who had a high positive change in IQ) had better coping mechanisms than decelerators (people who had a high negative change in IQ ). That is, accelerators had an objective, constructive, realistic approach to dealing with problems and frustrations whereas the decelerators approached problems and frustrations with defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms are characterized by withdrawal, denial, rationalization, and distortion. It can be seen that though the IQ is a reasonably stable measure of intelligence and usually a good predictor of future intellectual performance, one must consider an individual's emotional and motivational characteristics to be sure of the accuracy and relevancy of any individual IQ score. Environmental factors are also important in considering the probable nature of an individual's future intellectual development. The purpose of determining the stability of an individual's IQ is to be able to anticipate whatever problems he might encounter in his intellectual development. When problems are anticipated it is often possible to develop intervention programs and to perhaps alter the course of an individual's intellectual development.",

                "answer": "B",
                "solution": "Stability of IQ refers to the consistency of 2 or more IQ scores for one individual. There are two significant variables to be considered in the question of IQ stability. These are the interval between the initial test and the retest and the age of the individual. The shorter the interval between test and retest, the more stable the IQ. The age of the individual in question is important because the older the person is at the time of the initial IQ test, the more accurate will that IQ score be. Intelligence continues to change both qualitatively and quantitatively during development and the greatest changes occur early in development. Therefore, the difference in intelligence between a 3 - year-old and a 4 - year-old is greater than between a 14 year old and a 15 year old. In general the IQ is a fairly stable measure of intelligence. In a Swedish study,Husen(1951) found a correlation of .72 between the best scores of 613 3rd grade boys and the test scores of the same individuals ten years later. TheFelsResearch Institute (Sontag, Baker, & Nelson, 1958) conducted a study and found a correlation of .83 between the Stanford-Binetscores of the same individuals at three and four years of age. At age 12 the scores had a correlation of .46 with the scores from age 3.Bradway, Thompson, and Cravens (1958) conducted a study and found that initial IQ's had a correlation of. 65 with 10 - year retests and .59 with 25 - year retests. It should be noted that the stability of the IQ is effectively the same as its reliability. Despite whatever faults the IQ tests may have, they do have impressive reliabilities. One explanation for the increasing stability of the IQ with age is provided by the cumulative nature of intellectual development. An individual's intellectual skills at any one age include all the skills and knowledge acquired at an earlier age plus all newly acquired skills and knowledge. Predictions of IQ from age 10 to 16 would thus be more accurate than from 3 to 9, because scores at 10 represent more than half of the skills present at age 16 whereas scores at age 3 include a much smaller proportion of the skills and knowledge present at age 9. J. E. Anderson refers to the phenomenon of the increasingly close relationship between IQ scores at different ages as age increases as the 'overlap hypothesis'. Prerequisite learning skills also contribute significantly to the general stability of the IQ because they play an important role in subsequent learning. The more progress a child has made in the acquisition of intellectual skills and knowledge the better will he profit from subsequent learning experiences and the more stable his IQ. One reason behind childhood intervention programs (e.g.,Headstart) is that they help to provide children with prerequisite learning skills.

Johnson suggested that the stages of problem solving are analysis, implementation, and feedback.\nD. The stages of problem solving are production, judgment, and incubation.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAccording to Donald M. Johnson there are three stages in problem solving: preparation, production, and judgment. In the preparation stage, the individual assesses the problem: he determines its nature, evaluates the information available and considers the obstacles that may surface. The production stage involves a search for possible alternative solutions. Most research concerned with simple problem solving concentrates on this stage. The researcher measures the time a subject spends in solving the problem; the length of this interval reflects the subject's involvement in generating alternative solutions. The third stage of problem solving is judgment. At this level the person evaluates all the possible solutions to the problem and selects the one he thinks has the best chance of being correct. Some psychologists include a fourth stage in this scheme. They call it the \"incubation\" period. During this stage the person withdraws from the problem before a solution is found. He may need to engage in some other activity for some time before he can find the solution. Often when the individual returns to the problem he solves it with much ease. One explanation for this is that while the person is away from the problem the unconscious mind continues to work on it. Another explanation suggests that the incubation period allows the individual to \"clear his mind,\" that is, get over any short-sighted or repetitious behavior that is preventing him from finding the solution. The three basic stages of problem solving do not always occur in a neat, orderly fashion. Depending on the complexity of the problem, stages may warrant a number of repetitions. It may be necessary to reexamine the problem for new information, to repeat stages of production for different parts of the solution, or to evaluate possible solutions several times in the light of new information.",

A deprived environment enhances intellectual development\nD. Environment has no effect on intellectual development\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nSeveral studies have indicated that children who are raised in isolated regions, where they are deprived of the degree or quality of environmental stimulation which other children in less isolated areas receive, are intellectually inferior. One famous study concerning this aspect was done by Sherman and Key (1932) on a group of isolated mountain children which they call the \"Hollow Children.\" The Hollow Children lived in various isolated villages in the Blue Ridge Mountains about 180 miles west of Washington D.C. Interestingly, these villages had remained isolated in varying degrees for decades prior to the study. Sherman and Key chose four villages in the region to study. Each varied in its amount of contact with the outside world. For example, Colvin was the innermost village and was the most isolated. The other villages, in order of most isolation to least, were Needles, Rigby, and Oakton. Each of these villages varied in the amount of schooling available. The researchers found that Colvin provided the least amount of schooling. During the 12 years previous to the study, a school had been open a total of only 16 months. It was found that only three of the adult residents were literate. In Rigby, which was closer to civilization, a school had been open for 66.5 months during the same amount of time. Many of the adults here were literate and there was a post office which provided some contact with civilization. A village calledBriarsvillewhich was located at the foot of the mountain was much less isolated than the mountain villages and was used as a control group for the study. The researchers used various intelligence tests such as the Stanford-Binetand the Good enough Draw-A-Man test, to compare the intellectual ability of the extremely isolated children in Calvin to the less isolated children inBriarsville. Sherman and Key wanted to see if the environmental deprivation had any effect on intellectual development. Since most of the residents of the Blue Mountain area were of common ancestry (English and Scotch-Irish), it was assumed that the genetic pool was similar for most of the people in the region. Since heredity as a factor in intellectual development was more or less in check (controlled for), the researchers could more accurately gauge environmental influence as a factor. Two significant findings came out of this study. The first was that scores on the intelligence tests increased as one moved from the most isolated village to the least isolated. Hence, the children of Colvin had the lowest scores while the children ofBriarsville, the control group, had the highest. Secondly, it was found that older children (14 and 15-year-olds) performed worse than younger children. The very young children were not significantly below the test norms. This would indicate that a deprived environment has a detrimental effect on intellectual development. Both of these findings suggest that an individual's environment has an important influence on his ability to do well on these kinds of tests. As a cautionary note: there is no accurate definition of intelligence. In this study, it was defined as that which intelligence tests measure. One of Sherman and Key's most important and basic conclusions was that \"children develop only as the environment demands development.\"",

Operations such as reading, writing, game-playing, sewing, and many other skills must be learned. However, even here maturation plays a role, since there is a certain time in the course of development when the individual is ready to learn a particular skill. Maturation underlies the \"readiness\" or potentiality for learning such skills. Before this readiness is reached in the course of maturation, learning the particular skill is impossible. There are several kinds of readiness and these are reached at a characteristic age. For example, readiness for learning speech usually occurs around the age of 2 years, while readiness for learning how to read generally occurs at 6 years of age. Readiness comes to maturity fairly abrubtlyand when it does, learning occurs rapidly if ample opportunity is provided. One must remember, however, that rates of maturation differ among individuals.

                "solution": "There are several skills which must be learned. Operations such as reading, writing, game-playing, sewing, and many other skills must be learned. However, even here maturation plays a role, since there is a certain time in the course of development when the individual is ready to learn a particular skill. Maturation underlies the \"readiness\" or potentiality for learning such skills. Before this readiness is reached in the course of maturation, learning the particular skill is impossible. There are several kinds of readiness and these are reached at a characteristic age. For example, readiness for learning speech usually occurs around the age of 2 years, while readiness for learning how to read generally occurs at 6 years of age. Readiness comes to maturity fairly abrubtlyand when it does, learning occurs rapidly if ample opportunity is provided. One must remember, however, that rates of maturation differ among individuals. In general, if one ability develops or matures slowly, others will also, although there are exceptions to this rule."

Sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nSensory deprivation often occurs outside the laboratory, most notablyin social settings. The effects of sensory deprivation in such an environmentwere reported by Spitz (1945). He compared the developmentof children in an orphanage, where there was little sensory stimulation, to that of children who were raised in a nursing home and receiveda great deal more care and stimulation. The children in both homes received the same nutrition and medicalcare and lived in sanitary environments. The children in the orphanage, however, received less maternal stimulation, which has been foundto be a necessary factor in normal development. Here, six nurses caredfor 45 babies. In the nursing home, on the other hand, each mother tookcare of her own child. The babies in the orphanage received less visual stimulation than thebabies in the nursing home. In the nursing home, babies were often takenout of their cribs. From this vantage point they were able to see whatwas happening in the ward. The orphanage babies were sometimes takenout of their cribs when they were changed or fed. In addition, sheets weredraped over the bars of their cribs, preventing them from witnessing anyexternal events. This effect is similar to the one created by the use of translucentgoggles in laboratory experiments: light was admitted but objectscould not be discerned visually. Spitz's findings are important because they suggest that sensory andsocial deprivation during the first few years of life can adversely affect normaldevelopment. Spitz found that during the first four months of the babies' lives, scores on tests of development were the same for both groups. However, during the last four months of the first year, the orphanagebabies received lower scores on the same tests. This discrepancyin the scores shows that both groups began with basically the samepotential, but dissimilarities in their environments influenced differencesin test scores. Spitz found that several orphanage babies became greatly weakened, both physically and mentally. This led to a higher mortality rate amongthe orphanage children. Spitz also found that most of the nursing homebabies were walking and talking by ages two and three whereas onlytwo of the 26 orphanage babies could walk and talk at a comparable period.",

Learning is easier when the material is unfamiliar\nB. Learning is faster when there are fewer associations\nC.             The more meaningful something is, the easier it is to learn and retain it. Meaningfulness is measured by the number of associations they evoked.\nD. The more complex the material, the easier it is to learn\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nOne of the most important factors in verbal learning is the meaningfulnessof the material. An item is made meaningful by the associationsit evokes for the subject. These associations vary in their numberand in the way they are interrelated. Each item to be learned, a wordor nonsense syllable, evokes a number of associations. Some items elicitmore associations than others. For example, a subject may associate theitem BIK with bike, aBicpen or bicker. But the item BQR may mean absolutelynothing to him. The greater the number of associations elicited, the easier it is to learnand retain material because its meaningfulness is increased. If only avery few or no associations are evoked by an item, learning is difficult becausethe material is less meaningful to the learner. These points were illustratedby Noble (1952a, 1952b). The experimenters constructed a long listcontaining two syllable English words and two syllable nonsense words. An index of meaning was obtained for each word in the following manner: A group of subjects looked at the list, one word at a time, for 60 seconds, and reported their own lists of associations for each word. An indexof meaning was obtained for each item by counting the average numberof associations given by the group. Indices ranged from a low of 0.99 associations for the nonsense word \"govey\" to 9.61 associations for theword \"kitchen.\" On the basis of these indices, three lists of words were constructed. One list had an average \"meaningful index\" of 1.28, a second hadan index of 4.42, and a third had an index of 7.85. Subjects were then compared on their rate of learning the lists by theserial anticipation method. As required by the method, each word was presentedin a specific order a number of times. After the subject learned thelist, the first word was presented and the subject had to anticipate the nextone. When the following word was presented, he had to anticipate theone after that and so on. The list with the lowest \"meaningful index\" tookalmost three times as many trials to learn as the list with the highest index. The list with the intermediate index was between the extremes. The number of words in each list was the same. The only significantdifference was meaningfulness as measured by the number of associationsthey evoked. Therefore, the more meaningful something is, theeasier it is to learn and retain it. Other variables also affect the meaningfulness of verbal material. A verbalitem is more meaningful and easier to learn if it is similar to a word inthe subject's language. For example, an English-speaking subject may findthe word BIK easier to learn than BQR because the former is similar tothe types of words found in his native language. Meaningfulness also depends upon the familiarity the learner has withan item. An item which has been experienced more frequently will havegreater meaningfulness and will therefore be easier to learn. The lettersBIK have probably been seen more frequently by English-speakers thanBQR. Also, the more easily an item is pronounced, the greater meaningfulnessit has. BIK is easily pronounced as one unit but B-Q-R requiresthree separate responses. In paired-associate task experiments, the more meaningful the responseitem, the faster the learning rate. Meaningfulness can be facilitatedby coding material to make it more meaningful. For example, to learnBQR, it might be helpful to create a sentence such as Beautiful Queens are Rich. As the item takes on added meaning, learning becomes easier.",

Discrete tasks consist of a series of movements whichare separate from each other. Typing is an example of a discrete task. Rolling the knob to move the paper, striking a key, hitting the carriagereturn are all separate movements which comprise the task of typing.

An example of a continuous task is steering a drivingwheel in a car. The amount and direction of steering depends upon thecontinuous turning of the wheel various amounts depending upon the situationon the road. One characteristic of continuous skills is that they are not easily forgotten. A common example is bicycle riding. Most adults can ride a bicyclewithout too much difficulty even if the skill was not practiced in twentyor more years. One possible explanation for this is that continuous skillsare often practiced. Another reason may be that very little interferencefrom other tasks occurred during the intervals between the exerciseof the continuous skill.

As with so many perceptual processes, its nature is unknown though its measure has been taken and theorized about by a number of researchers. It is the capacity to attend to certain stimuli that has not yet been successfully programmed into any computer that may explain why pattern-recognition machines fall so far short of the human capacity. Traditionally, attention has been explained as a definite allocation of \"energy.\" No distinctions were made in types or degrees of attention; it was all considered part of the same process. This definition and approach to attention has been basically rejected by information-processing theorists who have tended to explain it as a focusing of analyzing neural mechanisms on a particular portion of the stimulus input field. Thus, when an organism pays attention to something he makes more careful and detailed analyses of the information coming into that part of the sensory receiving apparatus. Processing goes on with more sophisticated and limited mechanisms than he is using for the other incoming information. This analytic model presupposes two levels of attention: focal attention and a preattentive process. The preattentive process provides the material on which focal attention will act. An example of the more generalized activity of preattention is the fact that one can drive a car safely for 15 or 20 minutes without attending to the activity. Should a pedestrian suddenly cross in front of the car, the driver's attention would immediately focus on the mechanics of driving.",

Processing goes on with more sophisticated and limited mechanisms than he is using for the other incoming information. This analytic model presupposes two levels of attention: focal attention and a preattentive process. The preattentive process provides the material on which focal attention will act. An example of the more generalized activity of preattention is the fact that one can drive a car safely for 15 or 20 minutes without attending to the activity. Should a pedestrian suddenly cross in front of the car, the driver's attention would immediately focus on the mechanics of driving."

Sensory transduction for taste is the conversion of food textures into electrical signals.\nB. Sensory transduction for taste is the process where a physical stimulus from food or drinks are translated into an electrical message by the taste buds, which is then sent to the brain through three different nerves.\nC.             Sensory transduction for taste involves the translation of physical stimuli into sound waves.\nD. Sensory transduction for taste is processed by the olfactory system.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nSensory transduction is the process whereby a physical stimulus from the environment is translated into an electrical message which our brain can interpret or understand. Normally the physical stimuli for our experience of taste are chemical substances such as foods or drinks. Relatively little is known about how these chemical stimuli are converted into electrical messages. When food is taken into the mouth, it is mixed with the liquid present in the mouth, called saliva. The solution that forms may then flow into one of the many tiny 'holes' in one's tongue called taste pores. Each pore contains slender,hairlikestructures. These hairs are part of cells called taste buds, located underneath the taste pore. Taste buds cluster together, forming tiny bumps on your tongue. These bumps are called papillae. The taste buds are the receptor cells for taste. As a food solution flows into a taste pore, the hairs of the taste buds are stimulated. This somehow causes an electric event to occur. Nerve cells are located at the base of the taste buds. The electric event produced by the taste buds activates these nerve cells. The nerve cells then send electrical information about the original food solution along to the brain. There are three different nerves used to carry taste information to the brain. In addition some of these nerves carry information from other senses, such as touch.",

Standard scores and percentiles are used to find the mean score.\nC.             Standard scores and percentiles are not important in testing.\nD. Standard scores and percentiles are used to calculate the raw score.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nA standard score is a way of expressing an individual's raw score ona test in terms of its distance from the mean score of a tested group. The distance from the mean score is expressed in terms of the standard deviationof the distribution. The standard deviation is a measure of the variabilityor spread of scores in a group, that is a score of 1 corresponds towhatever score is 1 standard deviation above the mean. A score of - 1.7 is whatever score is 1.7 times the standard deviation below the mean. A score of 0 corresponds to the mean. Therefore if the mean in a distributionwas 100 and the standard deviation was 10 a standard score of1 would correspond to a raw score of 110. A standard score of - 1.7 wouldcorrespond to a raw score of 83. The examiner needs to know only thestandard score in order to interpret an individual's performance. He wantsto know where the individual stands in relation to the rest of the examinees; he does not need to know the raw score. From statistical tablesthe examiner can tell exactly what percentage of the people scored aboveand below the individual in question. Percentiles are a way of expressing scores in terms of the percentageof persons in the standardized sample who fall below a given rawscore. For example, if a raw score of 70 is in the 90th percentile, then 90 percent of the sample obtained raw scores below 70. Percentage scoresare not the same as percentiles. A percentage score refers to the percentageof problems answered correctly; percentages are expressed in termsof raw scores and percentiles are derived scores. A derived score, e.g. a percentile, gives the examiner information about an individual's relativestanding in a group. Raw scores cannot be interpreted in the same manner. Standard scores and percentiles are important in that they help the examinercompare different individuals on the same test and the same individualon different tests. A standard score of 1.0 always means the samething; it always corresponds to doing better than average (in fact, it alwaysmeans that an individual's score is in the 84th percentile and therefore84% of the examinees scored lower than he did). Regardless of thetype of test taken a score expressed in terms of percentiles or in terms ofthe standard deviation (standard scores) always has the same relative meaningvisavisgroup comparisons.",

The standard deviation is a measure of the variabilityor spread of scores in a group, that is a score of 1 corresponds towhatever score is 1 standard deviation above the mean. A score of - 1.7 is whatever score is 1.7 times the standard deviation below the mean. A score of 0 corresponds to the mean. Therefore if the mean in a distributionwas 100 and the standard deviation was 10 a standard score of1 would correspond to a raw score of 110. A standard score of - 1.7 wouldcorrespond to a raw score of 83. The examiner needs to know only thestandard score in order to interpret an individual's performance. He wantsto know where the individual stands in relation to the rest of the examinees; he does not need to know the raw score. From statistical tablesthe examiner can tell exactly what percentage of the people scored aboveand below the individual in question. Percentiles are a way of expressing scores in terms of the percentageof persons in the standardized sample who fall below a given rawscore. For example, if a raw score of 70 is in the 90th percentile, then 90 percent of the sample obtained raw scores below 70. Percentage scoresare not the same as percentiles. A percentage score refers to the percentageof problems answered correctly; percentages are expressed in termsof raw scores and percentiles are derived scores. A derived score, e.g. a percentile, gives the examiner information about an individual's relativestanding in a group. Raw scores cannot be interpreted in the same manner. Standard scores and percentiles are important in that they help the examinercompare different individuals on the same test and the same individualon different tests. A standard score of 1.0 always means the samething; it always corresponds to doing better than average (in fact, it alwaysmeans that an individual's score is in the 84th percentile and therefore84% of the examinees scored lower than he did). Regardless of thetype of test taken a score expressed in terms of percentiles or in terms ofthe standard deviation (standard scores) always has the same relative meaningvisavisgroup comparisons."

Retrieval can be of two kinds: it can occur rapidly with little or no active recall or it can require attention and effort. The first type of recall is \"effortless\" and occurs generally when the new information presented is identical or close to that which has been previously stored. The recognition of words that is required to read this paragraph is a good example of this type of retrieval. When the new information presented is not identical to that which has been previously stored it requires more effort to remember.

The information stored in the first instance was more strongly of a visual nature, while that of the second was more likely to be primarily verbal. Thus, the new information was in a form that was not identical to what was most strongly stored in memory. There appear to be stages of information retrieval. For instance, if asked to name the author of \"The Goldberg Variations\" or to describe the name of the nearest galaxy, some subjects would be able to do so effortlessly, others might require a clue and another group may be able to say immediately that they could not answer.

The experimental technique that has probably provided the most information in this area is one that involves the use of thetachtiscope.

The Thorndike-Lorge, which is a listing of the frequency of use of English words, is used to determine the frequency of a given word. The more commonly used words are more easily and quickly recognized than the rare words even if they have a similar shape and length. For example, \"yet\" is recognized more easily than \"yak,\\textquotedblright and \"accept\" more readily than \"accede.\" Many explanations for this phenomenon have been offered. The most commonly accepted today is the fragment theory. Fragment theory supposes that when a word is briefly presented to a subject he only sees a fragment of it. From this fragment he makes an educated \"guess\" as to what the word might be. He is much more likely to choose a familiar word, one that occurs frequently in common usage, that incorporates the fragment that he saw. Many predictions that can be made from this theory have been supported by experiment. Even rare words have low thresholds if there are no similar common words. If two words have the same general appearance, the rare word will have a higher threshold and the common word will be more often offered as an incorrect response to the stimulus. On the other hand, an equally rare word that does not have a common word similar to it, will not have such a high threshold.

Spearman maintained that all intellectual activities share a single common factor which he called the general factor, or \"g\". In addition to \"g\" there are numerous specific, or \"s\" factors each being strictly specific to a single activity.

Spearman claims that a two-factor theory implies that the aim of psychological testing should be to measure the amount of each individual' s \"g\". Both Raven's Progressive Matrices andCattell'sCulture Fair Intelligence Test were constructed as measures of \"g\". Multiple-factor theory accounts for another theory of intelligence. Here intelligence is viewed as consisting of a set of traits or factors. These traits are organized by group factors. A group factor is a factor that is common to a group of activities; a group factor may account for success in a number of related activities. For example, a verbal factor is a group factor that accounts for varying degrees of success on a vocabulary test, verbal analogies test, and a reading comprehension test.Thurstonewas one of the leading exponents of multiple-factor theory.Thurstone proposed about a dozen group factors which he designated as \"primary mental abilities\". These are: verbal comprehension, word fluency, number, space, associative memory, perceptual speed, and induction or general reasoning. A third theory of intelligence is referred to as a hierarchical theory of intelligence. Its proponents are Burt, Vernon, and Humphreys. Hierarchical theory is basically an alternative method of organizing the factors that determine intelligence. Spearman's g-factor is placed at the top of the hierarch. Two broad group factors, verbal- educational and practical-mechanical, are at the next level. On the next level there are other more specific group factors. Finally, on the last level there are a multiplicity of specific factors. Thus, the hierarchical theory of intelligence is basically an extension of Spearman's two-factor theory.",

Verbal materials are learned effectively based on the learner's interest\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are various characteristics of verbal materials which influencehow effectively they are learned: list length, item position, meaningfulness, similarity, frequency, concreteness and imagery. The abilityto transfer learning is also very important. The longer the list of items to be learned, the more difficult learning thelist becomes. The number of trials necessary increases very rapidly as thelist is lengthened, and the time required to learn the items increases correspondingly. The position of the items is also a very important factor. Subjects learnthe first and last items on a list best. This is called the primacy effect andtherecencyeffect, respectively. When a list contains a few items that aredifferent from the majority of items, the different items are learned morequickly. This is known as the isolation effect. The ease with which we learn something also depends on the meaningfulnessof the material. The more meaningful it is, the better it is learnedand retained. Meaningfulness of material is derived from how manyassociations the material can evoke and from the conceptual and hierarchicalrelations among its items. Similarity, though it sounds like a single variable, actually encompassesthree variables. Verbal units may be similar in that they look orsound alike, have the same meaning or belong to the same category. Studies have shown that learning a list of items becomes more difficultas the similarity in meaning or appearance of its items increases. A list containing the words sad, unhappy, depressed, miserable, burdened, withdrawn, gloomy and frowning is a much harder list to learn thana list containing adjectives which are not similar. Likewise, a list containingthe words bike, back, buck, bake, book is harder to learn than bike, front, cook, deer, read. Similarly in appearance, meaning or category between stimulus andresponse items also inhibits learning in paired-associate task experiments. It has been found that in paired-associate learning, similarity ofstimulus items has a greater inhibiting effect on learning than similarity ofresponse items. Frequency seems to act in the same way as meaningfulness. One isbetter able to differentiate the acquired characteristics of frequently seenwords so that they are easily recalled. If one encounters a word very often, one will learn it quickly and retain it for a very long time. Concreteness refers to a verbal item's position in a concrete-abstractdimension. For example, \"carrot\" is more concrete than \"vegetable.\" The more concrete a noun, the better the chances that it will elicita mental image (imagery). Therefore, it is easier to learn a concrete wordthan an abstract one. The type and amount of past learning a person has done affects his rateof acquisition of new material. Transfer of training may be positive or negative. What is learned in one situation is sometimes appropriate to anothersituation. When previous learning facilitates later learning or performance, it transfers positively. When previous learning interferes, it transfersnegatively. Positive transfer will probably take place if the new materialis similar to material previously learned. Positive transfer will make the learning of the new material an easier process.",

If one encounters a word very often, one will learn it quickly and retain it for a very long time. Concreteness refers to a verbal item's position in a concrete-abstractdimension. For example, \"carrot\" is more concrete than \"vegetable.\" The more concrete a noun, the better the chances that it will elicita mental image (imagery). Therefore, it is easier to learn a concrete wordthan an abstract one. The type and amount of past learning a person has done affects his rateof acquisition of new material. Transfer of training may be positive or negative. What is learned in one situation is sometimes appropriate to anothersituation. When previous learning facilitates later learning or performance, it transfers positively. When previous learning interferes, it transfersnegatively. Positive transfer will probably take place if the new materialis similar to material previously learned. Positive transfer will make the learning of the new material an easier process."

Perceptual-motor tasks are not affected by cultural influences.\nD. Perceptual-motor tasks are integrated, coordinated movements guided by perceptual input. Learning of these tasks depends on a combination of maturational limits and cultural determinants.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nRunning, riding a bicycle, knitting, and writing are examples of perceptual-motor tasks. These tasks require the performance of integrated, coordinated movements guided by perceptual input. Accomplishment of these skills relies equally on both the perceptual and motor systems. The many skills one learns in a lifetime which depend upon eye, foot and hand coordination are basically derived from the learning of two complex, basic patterns of motor functioning: bipedal locomotion (walking) and reaching-grasping-manipulation. Although it is \"natural\" for human beings to accomplish these skills, each individual must learn to coordinate his sensory, nervous and muscular functioning by exercise and practice. The development of many skills depends upon a combination of maturational limits and cultural determinants. The neuromuscular system of the child must be mature if he is to learn to walk, run and develop other more complex skills. The child's environment must also provide both opportunities and reinforcements for developing the skill. Elementary patterns of grasping and walking develop from a combination of maturation and learning. Running, jumping, hopping and skipping develop in pre-school years from the walking pattern. During school years both gross (e.g., swimming) and fine (e.g., writing) motor coordination are developed. Children all over the world are developing their motor skills during these years although the manner in which they develop them is culturally determined. A father in Canada may encourage his young son to ice skate while a father in a Pacific Island may decide it is more important for his son to swim. Traditional societies may culturally determine sex differences in motor skill learning. Boys have generally been encouraged to develop gross motor skills such as jumping, kicking and throwing. Girls have traditionally been encouraged to develop fine motor skills such as piano playing or sewing. These sex differences become most apparent in traditional cultures during the adolescent years. An illustration of how cultural determinants influence the learning of gross motor tasks, is shown in a study by McGraw (1935). McGraw found that children at two years of age could be taught to roller skate. Although they are physically mature enough to learn this skill, few two-year-olds know how to roller skate in our culture because it is not encouraged until a later age.",

Visual perceptions are a series of static images captured by the retina.\nD.

Normally, the eyes shift to a new fixation point every second.

For instance, as one reads this page, as many as three to four fixations may be occurring for each separate line of type. But one does not experience a confusingmelangeof visual impressions, one sees a solid, stationary page of print. This act of translating many different \"photographs\" on the retina into a comprehensible, consistent world has not been studied extensively, though it is one of the most basic and important processes in the human information transformation system. That visual experience is consistent and smooth even though actual physiological experience consists of a rapid succession of constantly changing impressions suggests that visual memory must provide a guideline to help the organism determine what is actually present. This memory has been conceptualized not as a series of many photographs, but as a schematic guideline to which each new fixation adds additional information. This can perhaps best be understood by comparing it to what is preserved of a sentence when one remembers only its meaning and not the exact words. This visual memory would serve to give consistency and orientation to new visual experiences and help one to correctly interpret ambiguous visual situations. Perception of movement aids the hypothesis that vision is a constructive process that occurs over time. Movements of the object itself along with movements of the head and eyes change the location of the stimulus that falls, on the retina, yet one perceives stable objects. These movements are actually an aid to certain types of depth perception. It must be the integration of retinal information over time that allows one to see a moving object as solid.

An IPSP is an inhibitory post synaptic potential. What are post synaptic potentials? Postsynaptic potentials refer to' changes in a nerve cell's charge relative to its environment. Normally, the inside of a nerve cell is negatively charged as compared to its surroundings. This is because there is a higher concentration of positive charges outside the cell than inside it. These positive charges cannot pass through the semi-permeable membrane of the cell. However, if a nerve cell is stimulated, this situation changes. The stimulation may be external, or it may come from within, for example, from another nerve cell. If the stimulus makes the nerve cell less negative, as would occur if the membrane now begins to allow positive charges to pass through, we say an excitatory postsynaptic potential has occurred. It is considered excitatory because if it is large enough, it may cause the neuron to fire; i.e., conduct the impulse along its axon. If, on the other hand, the stimulation causes the nerve cell to become more negative or hyperpolarized, we say an inhibitory postsynaptic potential has occurred. This stimulation is considered inhibitory because it will now take a larger excitatory stimulation to cause the cell to become sufficiently positive in order to fire. In summary, an EPSP causes the nerve cell to become less negative, thus making it more likely that it will fire.

A hormone is a type of organ\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe endocrine system constitutes the second great communicating system of the body, with the first being the nervous system. The endocrine system consists of ductless glands which secrete hormones. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. The hormone is carried via the circulation to other sites of the body where its actions are exerted. Hormones are typically carried in the blood from the site of production to the site(s) of action, but certain hormones produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus act directly on their target areas without passing through the blood. The distance travelled by hormones before reaching their target area varies considerably. In terms of chemical structure, hormones generally fall into two categories: steroids and amino acid derivatives. The latter ranges in size from small molecules containing several peptides to very large proteins. Hormones serve to control and integrate many body functions such as reproduction, organic metabolism and energy balance, and mineral metabolism. Hormones also regulate a variety of behaviors, particularly sexual behaviors. To determine whether a gland is responsible for a particular function or behavior, an investigator usually begins by surgically removing the gland and observing the effect upon the animal. The investigator would then replace the gland with one transplanted from a closely related animal, and determine whether the changes induced by removing the gland can be reversed by replacing it. When replacing the gland, the experimenter must be careful to ensure that the new gland becomes connected with the vascular system of the recipient. This must be done so that secretions from the transplanted gland can enter the blood of the recipient. The experimenter may then try feeding dried glands to an animal from which the gland was previously removed. This is done to see if the hormone can be replaced in the body in this manner. The substance in the glands will enter the blood stream via the digestive system and be carried to the target organ by the circulatory system. Finally, the experimenter may make an extract of the gland and purify it to determine its chemical structure. Very often the chemical structure of a substance is very much related to its function. Studying the chemical structure may enable the investigator to deduce a mechanism by which the gland-extract functions on a molecular level. The investigator may also inject the purified gland-extract into an experimental animal devoid of such a gland, and see whether the injection effected replacement of the missing function or behavior. Some hormonal chemicals have additive effects. The investigator may inject a dosage of the purified gland-extract to an intact animal to observe if there was any augmentation of the particular function or behavior under study.",

                "solution": "The endocrine system constitutes the second great communicating system of the body, with the first being the nervous system. The endocrine system consists of ductless glands which secrete hormones. A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. The hormone is carried via the circulation to other sites of the body where its actions are exerted. Hormones are typically carried in the blood from the site of production to the site(s) of action, but certain hormones produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus act directly on their target areas without passing through the blood. The distance travelled by hormones before reaching their target area varies considerably. In terms of chemical structure, hormones generally fall into two categories: steroids and amino acid derivatives. The latter ranges in size from small molecules containing several peptides to very large proteins. Hormones serve to control and integrate many body functions such as reproduction, organic metabolism and energy balance, and mineral metabolism. Hormones also regulate a variety of behaviors, particularly sexual behaviors. To determine whether a gland is responsible for a particular function or behavior, an investigator usually begins by surgically removing the gland and observing the effect upon the animal. The investigator would then replace the gland with one transplanted from a closely related animal, and determine whether the changes induced by removing the gland can be reversed by replacing it. When replacing the gland, the experimenter must be careful to ensure that the new gland becomes connected with the vascular system of the recipient. This must be done so that secretions from the transplanted gland can enter the blood of the recipient. The experimenter may then try feeding dried glands to an animal from which the gland was previously removed. This is done to see if the hormone can be replaced in the body in this manner. The substance in the glands will enter the blood stream via the digestive system and be carried to the target organ by the circulatory system. Finally, the experimenter may make an extract of the gland and purify it to determine its chemical structure. Very often the chemical structure of a substance is very much related to its function. Studying the chemical structure may enable the investigator to deduce a mechanism by which the gland-extract functions on a molecular level. The investigator may also inject the purified gland-extract into an experimental animal devoid of such a gland, and see whether the injection effected replacement of the missing function or behavior. Some hormonal chemicals have additive effects. The investigator may inject a dosage of the purified gland-extract to an intact animal to observe if there was any augmentation of the particular function or behavior under study."

            "text": "Question:\nWhat is involved in human discrimination learning?\n\nOptions:\nA. It is exclusively related to language acquisition.\nB. The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished.\nC.             It is only associated with punishment, not reward.\nD. It involves only the presence of a single stimulus.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe essential feature of discrimination learning is not whether a person can learn a particular response but rather, can he respond differentially to two or more stimuli? Infants learn discriminations in the same way that animals do during experimentation. The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished. In this way, after many occurrences, the infant learns to distinguish between a real puppy and a toy puppy, milk and solid food, etc. If the infant touches both a puppy and a toy puppy, the puppy will reward the infant by responding to his touch, whereas, touching the toy dog will result in an absence of reward (no response). Eventually, the infant learns to discriminate between the two types of dogs, real and toy. It is believed that these discriminations must take place before the acquisition of language; that is, before the infant can attach verbal labels to different stimuli. Since discrimination learning takes place during daily life, it is difficult to study its development. Therefore, psychologists have constructed situations where it can be studied in a controlled manner. Three of these situations are: probability learning, incidental learning, and reversal learning. The learning of discriminations in daily life is probabilistic. Both the stimuli to be discriminated and the reinforcements attached to them vary from situation to situation. For example, something white in a glass is probably milk, but not always. Human beings engage in a phenomenon known as probability matching, where the probability of a response matches the probability of an event. For example, a subject is presented with a panel which has two lights and is told to predict which light will come on first. The experimenter arranges the apparatus so that the second light comes on 75% of the time. The subject will start by predicting at a chance level (50% of the time), but as training progresses he will predict that the second light will come on just about as often as it actually does. An everyday typical discrimination situation is not only probabilistic, but it also involves multiple cues. The stimulus has more than one aspect which can be discriminated. For example, if a person is told that a certain movie theater is on the corner of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue, he will notice the street signs when he gets there as well as the different things he sees on his way: the coffee shops, people, and other aspects of the environment. In intentional learning the subject discriminates between the cues given to him. What he learns is determined by what he wants to learn, what instructions are given to him, and what his prior experiences are. Incidental learning refers to the formation of an unintended discrimination. In the example above, learning that the theater is on the corner of 86th Street and Lexington Avenue was intentional, but noticing that there were two coffee shops across the street and a boutique around the corner was incidental. In learning discriminations with multiple cues, one learns primarily those that one intends to learn. But depending on how much attention one is paying to other things, one might learn much about the other cues. In reversal learning more than one cue is involved in discrimination. In this process, after one discrimination has been established, the subject shifts to a task that is either the reverse of the first or is the same as the first but with a shift in the cues utilized. Kendler and Kendler's (1962) experiment illustrates this: Children were presented with two cups at a time. The cups were different in both size and color. On one trial a large black cup might be paired with a small white cup, or a large white cup with a small white cup, etc. In the first task, the children had to choose either large cup regardless of color. In the second task, one-half of the group was reinforced for making a reversal shift; the small cup was now the correct choice. The same attribute (size) was relevant, but its value was reversed. The other half of the group made a non-reversal shift: another attribute -- color -- became relevant. With lower organisms and young children, the reversal shift is difficult, and the non-reversal shift is relatively easy. But with older children and adults the opposite is true. The reason for this is believed to be the difference in verbal capacity. Young children do not depend upon language in mediational processes to the same extent that adults do. \"Mediation\" refers to the process of words, images or associations, internally aroused, acting as a link in making discriminations. For example, the mediating word for the attributes \"black\" and \"white\" is \"color.\" This is an abstract process which children find difficult or impossible to do. Because young children lack mediational facility, they learn non-reversal shifts more easily than reversal shifts. A reversal shift requires \"unlearning\" and then \"reversing\" original learning, but a non-reversal shift requires only that the relevant attribute of the first learning be ignored. As his verbal ability increases with age, the older person is better able to make discriminations which are linked to a verbal response. The discrimination task becomes one of classifying attributes according to a relevant concept (in this example, size). In a reversal shift, the same concept is required; nothing new has to be learned. For example, if the mediating concept is size and the original relevant attribute is \"large,\" the new relevant attribute would be \"small\" after a reversal shift. However, a non-reversal shift for the person with verbal facility requires that he extinguish his original learningthat size was important and recognize another attribute as being relevant to reinforcement, such as color. Thus, discriminations linked to a verbal response enable those with verbal facility (older children and adults) to learn reversal shifts with more ease.",

Anger is expressed through physical violence in adults\nD. Anger is caused by success in goal-directed activities\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nOne of the chief causes of anger in both children and adults is interference with goal-directed activity. Restriction of any desired activity will produce anger at any age. During infancy, any restriction in activity or exploratory motives causes anger as well as the compulsion to engage in tasks required by the parents. Physical constraints such as having to wash, having things taken away, losing an adult's attention, or failure at an attempted task all contribute to anger arousal in infancy and early childhood. In older children and adolescents the causes of anger shift from physical restrictions to social frustrations. Arguments, shunning, sarcasm, bossiness, and thwarting of social ambition are all common causes of anger for teenagers. Social frustration is also an important cause of anger for adults. Expression of anger, however, is much less overt in adults than in teenagers. Research has indicated that adults more frequently experience annoyance: mild feelings of anger. Like the causes of anger, expression of anger also changes with increasing age. Infants and young children express through temper tantrums, screaming, bullying, and fighting. Expression is usually direct, immediate, and physical. In adolescents, expression is subtle and in adults it is even more subtle. Increased social pressure makes physical and direct expression of anger undesirable; hence, expression becomes subtle, indirect, and verbal. Techniques include sarcasm, swearing, gossiping, and plotting.",

                "solution": "One of the chief causes of anger in both children and adults is interference with goal-directed activity. Restriction of any desired activity will produce anger at any age. During infancy, any restriction in activity or exploratory motives causes anger as well as the compulsion to engage in tasks required by the parents. Physical constraints such as having to wash, having things taken away, losing an adult's attention, or failure at an attempted task all contribute to anger arousal in infancy and early childhood. In older children and adolescents the causes of anger shift from physical restrictions to social frustrations. Arguments, shunning, sarcasm, bossiness, and thwarting of social ambition are all common causes of anger for teenagers. Social frustration is also an important cause of anger for adults. Expression of anger, however, is much less overt in adults than in teenagers. Research has indicated that adults more frequently experience annoyance: mild feelings of anger. Like the causes of anger, expression of anger also changes with increasing age. Infants and young children express through temper tantrums, screaming, bullying, and fighting. Expression is usually direct, immediate, and physical. In adolescents, expression is subtle and in adults it is even more subtle. Increased social pressure makes physical and direct expression of anger undesirable; hence, expression becomes subtle, indirect, and verbal. Techniques include sarcasm, swearing, gossiping, and plotting."

Decay Theory is supported if the experimental group recalls significantly less than the control group\nD. Both theories are supported if the control group recalls significantly less than the experimental group\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nIn order to devise an experiment to distinguish between the Decay and Interference Theories of forgetting, the hypotheses of both theories need to be clearly defined. Step 1: Definining the hypotheses. The Decay Theory, which states that memories fade with the passing of time, would expect no difference in the results of a retention test between subjects who rest during a retention interval, and subjects who remain active during the same retention interval. The Interference Theory would expect a significant difference in the amount recalled on a retention test, between the two groups of subjects. Those subjects who remain active during the retention interval are expected to suffer interference from the activity they engaged in after their original learning task. Following a statement of hypotheses, an experimental situation should be designed. Step 2: Experimental design method Subjects:Two groups of subjects should be employed: a control group - subjects who rest after an initial learning task, and an experimental group - subjects who enegage in an activity after an initial learning task. Procedure:(a) Present learning task A to the control and experimental groups. (b) During a given retention interval (e.g., 2 hours), allow the control group to rest, while the experimental group works on learning task B. (c) Present a learning task A retention test to both groups of subjects. Step 3: Results If the results of the learning task A retention test indicate that both groups of subjects recall the same amount from learning task A, then the findings would support the Decay Theory. The results would prove that regardless of the activities a subject engages in, the mere passage of time progressively fades memories, thus causing \"forgetting.\" In contrast, if the results of the learning task A retention test show that the experimental group recalls a significantly fewer amount than the control group, then the results would support the Interference Theory. It would provide evidence that learning task B caused response competition, indicating that interference from other memories causes \"forgetting.\"",

In tracing the history of this interest there can be seen three distinct periods in the development of social psychology as it exists today: the philosophical, statistical and analytical periods. The philosophical approach to individual behavior in social groupings can be found as far back as 2000 B.C. in the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi.

This philosophical tradition and approach, as we can see dominates the history of social psychology, for the next stage, the statistical or empirical stage, only began approximately 100 years ago with the work of Francis Galton on human genetics. During this stage in the development of social psychology emphasis was on the description of human traits and the conditions of human society. Generally, it relies upon systematic data gathering to obtain information about the conditions of human nature and life. Galton, inspired by Charles Darwin's views on natural selection, conducted research on the transmission of genius genetically by tracing the history of families whose members had attained great prominence. Also in this tradition is the work of Binet in standardizing tests for human intelligence; Durkheim, who collected statistics on suicide; and the work of the demographists--scientists who study population characteristics. Data gathering had begun. If the statistical stage began to provide factual descriptive characteristics of human characteristics, then the analytical period, which began at about the turn of this century, is the move toward probing beneath the descriptive data to understand the causal factors in that data.

The vestibular organs are the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans. They provide us with a sense of balance through information about the movements and position of our head.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nOur vestibular sense provides us with a sense of balance. It does this through information about the movements and position of our head. There are two groups of vestibular organs. These are the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans. There are three semicircular canals. They are located in the inner part of our ear. Each one lies in a different plane. That is, if they were lying on this paper, one canal would run from top to bottom. Another would run across the paper. The third canal would run through the paper and out the back of this book. The canals are filled with fluid. When our head is rotated, this fluid moves. Which fluid moves depends upon the particular head motion we make. For instance, we can move our head up and down. In this case, the fluid in the canal that is oriented up and down will move. When this fluid moves, it puts pressure on special cells with hairs that are located in the canals. These hair cells send information about our head's movements to the brain. The canals do not respond to continuous movement. Rather, the hair cells in the canals respond only to changes in the rate of motion of the head. Thus when a dancer is spinning, the semicircular organs are stimulated only when he/she speeds up or slows down. Theotolithorgans are smallstonelikecrystals. They are also located in the inner part of our ear. Unlike the semicircular canals, the otolithsdo not respond to movements o Rather, they respond to the actual position of one's head. If your head is upright, gravity stimulates the otolithcrystals in a certain way. They then send this information to the brain. The brain interprets this message and concludes that the head is upright. Together, the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans provide one with a sense of balance. You know that you instinctively straighten up when thrown off balance. This could not be done without the information provided by the vestibular organs.",

                "solution": "Our vestibular sense provides us with a sense of balance. It does this through information about the movements and position of our head. There are two groups of vestibular organs. These are the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans. There are three semicircular canals. They are located in the inner part of our ear. Each one lies in a different plane. That is, if they were lying on this paper, one canal would run from top to bottom. Another would run across the paper. The third canal would run through the paper and out the back of this book. The canals are filled with fluid. When our head is rotated, this fluid moves. Which fluid moves depends upon the particular head motion we make. For instance, we can move our head up and down. In this case, the fluid in the canal that is oriented up and down will move. When this fluid moves, it puts pressure on special cells with hairs that are located in the canals. These hair cells send information about our head's movements to the brain. The canals do not respond to continuous movement. Rather, the hair cells in the canals respond only to changes in the rate of motion of the head. Thus when a dancer is spinning, the semicircular organs are stimulated only when he/she speeds up or slows down. Theotolithorgans are smallstonelikecrystals. They are also located in the inner part of our ear. Unlike the semicircular canals, the otolithsdo not respond to movements o Rather, they respond to the actual position of one's head. If your head is upright, gravity stimulates the otolithcrystals in a certain way. They then send this information to the brain. The brain interprets this message and concludes that the head is upright. Together, the semicircular canals and theotolithorgans provide one with a sense of balance. You know that you instinctively straighten up when thrown off balance. This could not be done without the information provided by the vestibular organs."

Mead was particularly interested in the differences between the sexes in each society and found distinct differences in the expected modes of behavior for males and females among the three cultures. The three tribes Mead studied were theArapesh, theMundugumor, and theTchambulitribes. She found that both sexes in theArapesh culture were \"placid and contented, unaggressive andnoninitiatory, noncompetitive and responsive, warm, docile, and trusting.\" In contrast, Mead found that both the men and women of theMundugumortribe \"developed as ruthless, aggressive, positively sexed individuals, with the maternal cherishing aspects of personality at a minimum.\" In the third tribe, theTchambuli, she found a \"genuine reversal of the sex attitudes of our own culture.\" Hence, we see three cultures, each with its unique standard for appropriate behavior. In theArapeshtribe, \"feminine\" behavior is the norm for both sexes; in theMundugumor, \"masculine\" behavior is the norm for both; in theTchambuli, males are \"feminine\" and females are \"masculine.\" When discussing personality as it relates to culture, one should look at the environment of a society, since this largely determines the kind of society which develops. TheArapeshwere an agricultural tribe. They inhabited the sterile mountain regions some distance away from the coast of New Guinea. TheMundugumorwere cannibalistic. They lived along the banks of a fierce jungle river called the Sepik, which they greatly feared. Like theArapesh, theTchambuliwere an agricultural tribe. They were a highly artistic people. In this culture, where the appropriate behavior of the sex roles was \"reversed,\" the men were in charge of the artistic activities while the women were engaged in the practical work necessary for survival. While the men spent a great deal of their time practicing various ceremonial dances and experimenting with various art forms, the women gathered food. From her studies, Mead believed that the development of such personality traits as masculinity andfeminityare not dependent on the individual's sex, but rather on his particular cultural environment--the values, beliefs, and standards of behavior of the society in which he lives. This is not to say that everyone in a particular culture accepts and lives by its rules; there are always those individuals who are considered deviant.

Long-term memory has limited storage capacity.\nB. Long-term memory can only be measured through recall.\nC.             Long-term memory cannot be disrupted by interference effects.\nD. Long-term memory can hold large amounts of material permanently and can be measured through recall, recognition, and savings methods.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nIn contrast to STM, long-term memory (LTM) is capable of holding large amounts of material permanently. Information that is needed every day, as one's telephone number, vocabulary, one's birthdate, etc., is stored in LTM and retrieved when needed. Information that has been rehearsed in short-term memory is transferred to the more permanent LTM store. There are three ways to measure the amount of LTM retention: recall, recognition and savings. The recall method requires that the subject reproduce something learned in the past with a minimum of cues. This is the most difficult way to remember information; therefore, the smallest amount of retention is measured with this method. When a student is asked to take an essay examination, for example, the instructor is utilizing the recall method of retention. The recognition method is another frequently used method of measuring retention. The subject must recognize whether or not he has been exposed to the information before. This method is most frequently used in multiple-choice examinations. There is, however, a chance factor that the student may correctly guess the answer without really remembering the information, thereby inflating the amount of retention measured. The third method of studying long-term memory retention, and the one most frequently used by psychologists in experimental studies on retention, is the savings method. The subject is required to learn something that he has already learned before. The measure of retention is the difference between the time or number of trials required for original mastery and the time or number of trials required for the second learning. For example, if it took 40 tries to learn a list of digits the first time, but only 20 tries the second time, the savings would be 50 percent. The savings method shows retention long after other methods have stopped showing retained material. In one study (Burtt, 1941), a psychologist read his 15 month-old son passages in Greek each day for three months. When the boy was 8 years old, he was required to learn the same selections in addition to new ones. The results showed that the old selections were learned in less time than the new ones. Therefore, exposure (even in infancy) to complex \"nonsense\" material resulted in savings at a later date. Although it may be difficult to recall material previously learned, if the opportunity to relearn or use the material again is presented, a considerable amount of savings may be found. LTM may be disrupted by interference effects. Retroactive inhibition (interference) occurs when the retention of information is interfered with because of activities which occurred after the initial learning. For example, a person who goes to a big party and learns the names of many new people may forget names learned early in the evening because the ones learned later will interfere with the early learning. However, if he forgot the names of the people he learned later in the evening, proactive inhibition (interference) may be taking place. Here, the early learning interferes with the retrieval of material learned later. The less interference effects of any kind, the greater the probability of retaining information.",

Projective testing assumes that all psychologists believe in the concept of the unconscious.\nB. Projective testing assumes that all personality traits are observable.\nC.             Projective testing assumes that there are unconscious elements of the personality that can be determined by projective techniques and that responses are expressions of unconscious desires, conflicts, and impulses.\nD. Projective testing is based on the assumption that individuals are always aware of their unconscious aspects.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe fundamental assumption behind projective testing is that there are unconscious and therefore deeper and more complex elements of the personality that cannot be determined and measured by objective techniques but can be determined by projective techniques. Individuals are often not aware of these unconscious aspects of their personality and thus in self-report personality inventories (e.g., MMPI) they do not reveal any information about these aspects of their personalities. Since projective testing allows the subject to freely associate to the stimuli presented, it is assumed that the responses are expressions (projections) of unconscious desires, conflicts, and impulses. The subject \"projects\" into the stimulus material his needs and attitudes. It is assumed that when the individual's mind is \"free to wander\" then it will \"fix\" on those issues that are most important. Projective examiners often try to conceal the purpose of these tests so that the subjects will not be defensive. A defensive attitude on the part of the subject will prevent free expression of unconscious elements. The mostconflictualimpulses will be censored. Another basic assumption of projective methods is that the production of responses depends largely upon basic personality factors. An appropriate analysis of the productions can reveal the personality structure of the individual. While most psychologists agree that there are unconscious or \"deeper\" aspects to the personality, not all psychologists assume that these aspects can be determined and/or measured. Behaviorists and Learning Theorists continually stress that only observable behavior is scientifically meaningful, anything said about the \"unconscious\" is purely speculatory. Some psychologists (e.g.,Allport) think that if there are unconscious aspects of the personality, they are unimportant anyway; these psychologists stress the importance of current behavior patterns.",

                "solution": "The fundamental assumption behind projective testing is that there are unconscious and therefore deeper and more complex elements of the personality that cannot be determined and measured by objective techniques but can be determined by projective techniques. Individuals are often not aware of these unconscious aspects of their personality and thus in self-report personality inventories (e.g., MMPI) they do not reveal any information about these aspects of their personalities. Since projective testing allows the subject to freely associate to the stimuli presented, it is assumed that the responses are expressions (projections) of unconscious desires, conflicts, and impulses. The subject \"projects\" into the stimulus material his needs and attitudes. It is assumed that when the individual's mind is \"free to wander\" then it will \"fix\" on those issues that are most important. Projective examiners often try to conceal the purpose of these tests so that the subjects will not be defensive. A defensive attitude on the part of the subject will prevent free expression of unconscious elements. The mostconflictualimpulses will be censored. Another basic assumption of projective methods is that the production of responses depends largely upon basic personality factors. An appropriate analysis of the productions can reveal the personality structure of the individual. While most psychologists agree that there are unconscious or \"deeper\" aspects to the personality, not all psychologists assume that these aspects can be determined and/or measured. Behaviorists and Learning Theorists continually stress that only observable behavior is scientifically meaningful, anything said about the \"unconscious\" is purely speculatory. Some psychologists (e.g.,Allport) think that if there are unconscious aspects of the personality, they are unimportant anyway; these psychologists stress the importance of current behavior patterns."

These are considered the four skin senses. Psychologists are not certain that specific receptors in the skin correspond to specific skin senses. However, the following distinctions do appear fairly certain. It seems that free nerve fibers located in the skin are responsible for our temperature sensations. The temperature of our skin is generally slightly lower than that of our blood. Free nerve fibers in the skin respond to changes in the difference between skin and blood temperature. For example, the temperature of our blood is roughly 38\\textdegreeC. The skin temperature of our forearm is usually 33\\textdegreeC. This is a 5\\textdegree difference. If some ice is put on your arm, the temperature of your skin will be lowered. The difference between your skin and blood temperatures will be increased. The increase is what the free nerves respond to. You will then feel cold. It seems that there are specific nerve fibers responding to either heat or cold. Pressure, or touch, is another of the skin senses. There are a number of different receptors in the skin that signal that we have been touched. TheMeissnercorpuscle is one such structure. It is located in the hairless regions of our body. It may be found, for example, in the palms of your hands. The basket nerve ending is located at roots of hairs. It is believed to respond to touch in those body regions that have hair. Finally, small capsules calledPaciniancorpuscles are thought to respond when deep pressure is applied to the skin. The stimulus that the above pressure receptors respond to is the bending or deforming of part of our skin. Therefore, when one first puts a watch on, you feel it. Immediately after, though, you \"forget\" that it is there. The initial bending of the skin that the watch caused was relayed to your brain by one of the pressure receptors. Therefore, you felt it. However, once the watch is on, your skin remains in the same place. It is no longer being actively bent. The pressure- receptors do not respond to this constant pressure. Therefore, you do not feel that you are constantly being touched' by your watch. Pain is the last of the skin senses. It appears that unspecialized free nerve endings in the skin respond to pain. Scientists are not certain exactly what stimulus is needed in order for us to feel pain. It was first thought that damage to a part of the body causes pain. This is not entirely true. We know that as parts of our body are destroyed, the body repairs them as quickly as it can. It appears, then, that we feel pain when our body is damaged faster than it can be repaired.

The classical view only considers discrimination/detection/recognition ability.\nD. TSD considers only the subject's ability to detect a stimulus\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe Theory of SignalDetectability(TSD) is a theory which maintains that the classical view of the \"threshold\" is an oversimplification. Proponents of TSD argue that anytime a subject reports that a signal is present, the subject is actually telling the experimenter two things: the subject's ability to detect the stimulus (e.g. how good is his eyesight ?) and the subject's motivation to detect the stimulus (e.g. will he receive $100 for detecting the signal). The classical view, however, maintains that the subject is telling the experimenter only one thing: discrimination/detection/recognition ability. The classical psychophysicists did include \"catch trials\" (trials where no stimulus was presented) in their experiments, but they used them only to assure that their subject would maintain vigilance. No attempt was made to analyze catch trials systematically or statistically. Proponents of TSD maintain that it is essential to analyze these \"false alarms\" to separate \"bias\" from \"sensitivity.\" Consider the following experiment: a blind man is placed in a room before a light which the experimenter controls. The experiment involves asking the blind man to tell the experimenter whether the light is on (which he is told will be the case 50% of the time) or off (which he knows will be the case the other 50% of the time). The blind man will receive $1 every time he says that the light is on, when it is in fact on. There is no penalty for incorrectly reporting the presence of the light (not unlike the classical psychophysics experiment). The blind man, if he's smart, will of course report that the light is on every trial. He never misses the \"signal.\" He wins $50. By classical methods of data analysis, he can see perfectly. The TSD, however, takes into account statistically the fact that the blindmanmade as many \"false alarms\" as \"hits.\" He cannot see better than chance. He succeeds at the game because of his \"response bias.\" Consider the less extreme case of a situation where a \"normal\" subject receives $1 for hits, but is penalized $1 for false alarms. But this time he is told that the signal will be present 80% of the time. It may be expected that the normal subject will not say \"present\" every time, but probably more than 80% of the time. He will most likely avoid saying a signal is present when he is certain it is not, but reports its presence when there is some chance that it occurred. None of this hypothetical decision making (at least in the latter example) need be conscious. It is not assumed that the subject is lying, simply that given an ambiguous situation (like a detection experiment) the uncertainty of whether a stimulus is present or not is resolved both by sensory discrimination and by motivation/expectation/bias . The TSD is probably the dominant view in contemporary psychophysics. The fact that a given subject's responses to identical stimulus arrays can be manipulated by expectation and bias is compelling (subjects of course often insist that there was no change in their strategies; they are not lying; the stimulus is ambiguous). It should be noted, however, that even though proponents of TSD can, by employing statistics, separate out the effects of bias from actual sensory ability, the threshold values (actually their range in normal subjects) obtained by classical psychophysicists over the years appear to be remarkably accurate. TSD may thus be seen most profitably as an extension of, rather than a replacement for, the classical concept of threshold.",

There is often a common element in the different events that permits this concept formation. For example, we learn to respond to a number of different two and three-dimensional impressions with the label \"man,\" and to many different four-legged animals as \"cat.\" \"Iconic\" or visual concept formation appears to be of an abstractive nature. A visual image presented to a person appears to be compared to memories of similar past events and finally stored or assimilated as part of the overall concept of which it is a part.

Subjects were shown lists of visual patterns of familiar objects in common categories such as \"tables.\" One group of subjects was required to name the object at the time of learning and the other was not. Subjects were then tested either immediately after exposure to the lists or six weeks later. They were first asked to recall the name of the particular objects and then they were asked to pick out from a group of similar objects the exact item they had seen. The group that had verbalized the names of the items did much better with verbal recall of what they had seen when they were tested immediately, but when the testing occurred after six weeks, there was no difference in the verbal recall of the two groups. Apparently, the ability to recall after six weeks was strongly related to the calling forth of a visual image and then finding the name that corresponded to the image. It was also discovered that the ability to remember the name of the object was completely unrelated to the ability to select the correct table from the many tables presented. Further, subjects had an extremely difficult time recognizing the precise table. They seemed to have placed the impression of the table into the general category of \"tables\" so that the name could be recalled, but not the exact representation of the table. It was concluded from these results that the objects that were seen had become a part of a visual system--or iconic structure--that represented the concept of table. This ability of the mind to go from the particular to the general reduces the probability that one will be able to rememberthe exact details of what was seen. However, it does make it possible to handle more information and provides an economical storing mechanism. It also gives a code with which to think. Since the nervous system stores highly abstracted representations of what has been seen or experienced, the existence of iconic concepts which represent the real world in a derived manner, begins to answer the question of how \"universals\" (general categories) are represented in memory.

The tonotopic organization refers to the spatial representation of tones in the brain and on the basilar membrane in the ear, enabling the brain to distinguish between different tones.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe termtonotopicorganization refers to the way auditory information is organized in our brain. Specific tones are thought to be represented by specific places in the parts of our brain that deal with hearing. For instance, a low tone may activate cells to the right. A higher tone, on the other hand, may activate cells further left. This is an example of atonotopicorganization. Different tones create different kinds of vibrations in the air. These vibrations are translated into electrical messages for our brain by special hair cells. These hair cells are located on a membrane called the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane lies in the innermost part of our ear. It has been found that high tones stimulate hair cells which are closer to the middle part of our ear. Lower tones, on the other hand, affect hair cells farther away from the middle ear. Thus we have a spatial representation of tone at the level of the basilar membrane. This means that a specific tone is represented by a specific place on the basilar membrane. This arrangement continues in the brain.

                "solution": "The termtonotopicorganization refers to the way auditory information is organized in our brain. Specific tones are thought to be represented by specific places in the parts of our brain that deal with hearing. For instance, a low tone may activate cells to the right. A higher tone, on the other hand, may activate cells further left. This is an example of atonotopicorganization. Different tones create different kinds of vibrations in the air. These vibrations are translated into electrical messages for our brain by special hair cells. These hair cells are located on a membrane called the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane lies in the innermost part of our ear. It has been found that high tones stimulate hair cells which are closer to the middle part of our ear. Lower tones, on the other hand, affect hair cells farther away from the middle ear. Thus we have a spatial representation of tone at the level of the basilar membrane. This means that a specific tone is represented by a specific place on the basilar membrane. This arrangement continues in the brain. Specific places on the basilar membrane appear to stimulate specific corresponding places within the brain. Thus there is a spatial organization of tones in the brain. It is thought that this organization enables our brain to distinguish between different tones."

Encoding and Retrieval\nC.             Interference and Time-Decay\nD. Rehearsal and Forgetting\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nMaterial in short-term memory has a very short life span if it is not reinforced by conscious rehearsal (repeating the information to oneself). Two theories that explain the brief recall ability of this memory system are the \"interference\" and the \"time-decay\" explanations. The interference model can be understood by assuming that short-term memory has a set number of spaces in which it can hold information. When the information that is entering is greater than the space available, some items are forgotten or replaced by the new information. Generally, the items that are forgotten are those in the middle of the list. This is because what is learned first usually interferes with what comes later (proactive interference) and what is learned later usually interferes with what came earlier (retroactive interference). Thus, it is the items in the middle that are most susceptible to forgetfulness. Some theorists have also tried to explain the limited capacity of short-term memory by supposing that the longer an item stays in memory, he weaker it becomes until finally it can no longer be recalled at all. This process would be analogous to an electricalcapacitatorwhose charge decays with time: each unit of time would weaken the traces of the previously acquired information. The test of these two theories is difficult to devise because it is very difficult to design an experiment in which a subject is \"doing nothing,\" which would be necessary to test for the time decay theory. If the subject is not given a task to do, he might be rehearsing the material. Therefore, a perfect memory of the material could be explained by rehearsal or lack of interference. A poor memory also proves nothing, time decay or interference could explain it, particularly if another task is given. In experiments that have been designed to present a task that would involve different material and not interfere with retention, such as the task of detecting a weak signal in noise for a subject who had just heard a set of letters, the results indicate that both theories may be somewhat correct, but neither exclusively. Thirty seconds after the material is presented, the subjects retain it quite well, but after these thirty seconds, the information becomes very weak--the smallest amount of interference will destroy it. Therefore, it appears that rapid forgetting in short-term memory is due both to the passage of time and to interference from new information. Of course, from one point of view, time and new information are synonymous to the nervous system which is continually processing the input from the environment.",

The five mental processes necessary in problem solving according to the component process theory of cognitive development are encoding, memory, evaluation, deduction, and mediation.\nC.             The five mental processes are encoding, retrieving, decision making, reasoning, and perceiving.\nD. The five mental processes are problem solving, decision making, perception, attention, and memory.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nPiaget described cognitive development as a sequence of operations through which a child progresses. American psychologists, however, prefer the component process theory of cognitive development. The theory is based on the assumption that a child's cognition develops as he reaches certain levels of competence in various cognitive skills. As the child gains cognitive abilities, they are integrated into a general cognitive ability. The component process theory is concerned with problem solving. The degree of success achieved is used as an index for measuring cognitive ability. Before a child is fully competent to solve problems, he must be capable of using five mental processes: encoding, memory, evaluation, deduction, and mediation. Encoding refers to the acknowledgment, understanding, and labeling of stimuli encoded as images. At this point in development, the child can imagine a particular object or sensation--he does not need to perceive it directly. When he acquires language, words are used in the encoding process. A child's success at problem solving is contingent on his ability to encode stimuli properly--he must be able to recognize it and know what it is called. The next step in the problem solving process is called memory. The child must be able to remember stimuli he has encoded and be able to draw on that information when it is needed to solve a problem. Language increases the child's memorization capacity to a large degree. Generally, it is the child's repetition of the words that describe a particular experience or stimuli that later enables him to remember the stimuli. Research indicates that the extensiveness of the child's vocabulary is an important factor in problem solving ability. The third mental process of problem solving is called evaluation. At this level the child sets up a hypothesis and weighs its advantages and disadvantages. The process of evaluation can begin at age 2. The next step in the problem solving process consists of the twin processes of deduction and hypothesis generation. Here, the child draws on hypotheses he has already made in order to arrive at a decision or make a deduction when confronted with a problem. For example, a child may know that both scissors and razor blades can be used to cut paper. If one of these instruments is not available, he will use the other. Hence, the hypothesis--both scissors and razor blades can cut paper--leads to the deduction: use one to cut paper; if it isn't available, use the other. The last of the problem solving mental processes is mediation. Mediation refers to the use of various tools or mediators to facilitate internalization of thought. Mediators include words, images, and concepts. The use of mediators is necessary in solving reversal-shift problems where the subject is asked to do the opposite of what he did in an earlier identical situation. For example, a child is presented with two containers filled to different levels with liquids of different colors. He is then asked to choose the container with the greater amount of liquid. To solve the problem he must disregard the color of the liquid. Once he learns to do this, he is asked to select the container with the least amount of liquid. If the child has good verbal mediation skills he will do this successfully. He can use words as mediators to tell himself which container has the least amount of liquid. Children's use of language as a cognitive tool usually occurs between the ages of 5 and 7.",

            "text": "Question:\nCan intelligence tests be used for diagnosing psychopathology ?\n\nOptions:\nA. Intelligence test scores can be used for diagnosing psychopathology.\nB. Intelligence test scores can determine the type of psychopathology.\nC.             Intelligence test scores can accurately predict future psychopathological behavior.\nD. It has not proven possible to make psychiatric diagnoses on the basis of intelligence test scores.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nWechsler has described a number of diagnostic uses for his intelligence tests. First of all, he claims that the amount of scatter (variance) or the discrepancy among the various subtest scores is higher for the psychopathological (psychopathological meaning being mentally disturbed) than fornormals. Wechsler also maintains that various score patterns, i.e., lower scores in performance than in verbal etc., can be associated with particular clinical syndromes such as schizophrenia, brain damage, anxiety states, and delinquency. Decades of research have failed to produce data that corroborates Wechsler's claims for his intelligence test. Wechsler failed to take into account several methodological requirements in making his claims. First of all, before Wechsler can claim that there is scatter among the subtest scores he must determine what the minimum statistically significant difference between subtest test scores would be. The reason for doing this is that the test scatter may be attributable to normal chance factors (error variance) rather than to specific individual differences (e.g., psychopathology). It may in fact be normal for subtest scores to differ by 10 - 15 points. Another point that Wechsler failed to consider was that statistical analysis shows that differences of 15 points or more between only two subtests will occur on the average of five times in every normal person's record (there are 55 possible inter-test differences). Therefore, unless a person has more than 5 or 6 large inter-test differences it is not possible to determine if he is psychopathological. Wechsler also failed to cross-validate his original findings. When Wechsler compared a pathological sample's test scores to a normal sample's test scores he did not recognize that the differences he found could easily have been attributable to sampling error. When other researchers submitted Wechsler's findings to cross-validation they discovered that Wechsler's initial findings were invalid. Another problem with Wechsler's contentions is that there are other conditions that could have accounted for atypical variations among subtest scores besides psychopathology. Such variations may result not only from pathology but also from differences in educational, occupational, cultural, or other background factors. For example, language handicap due to cultural deprivation could account for lower verbal than performance scores. The diagnostic categories that Wechsler used in his studies were imprecise, unreliable, and somewhat crude. Designations like brain damage and schizophrenia are associated with varied behavior and thus are not always useful in identifying typical test patterns. All in all, it has not proven possible to makepsychiatriatic diagnoses on the basis of intelligence test scores. Since psychopathological behavior is not consistent or specifically identifiable it may not be possible to associate a clinical syndrome with specific test behaviors. Moreover, the relationship between intelligence and personality is elusive at best and it does not seem possible at this time to state with any certainty how personality characteristics interact with intelligence.",

Wechsler also maintains that various score patterns, i.e., lower scores in performance than in verbal etc., can be associated with particular clinical syndromes such as schizophrenia, brain damage, anxiety states, and delinquency. Decades of research have failed to produce data that corroborates Wechsler's claims for his intelligence test. Wechsler failed to take into account several methodological requirements in making his claims. First of all, before Wechsler can claim that there is scatter among the subtest scores he must determine what the minimum statistically significant difference between subtest test scores would be. The reason for doing this is that the test scatter may be attributable to normal chance factors (error variance) rather than to specific individual differences (e.g., psychopathology). It may in fact be normal for subtest scores to differ by 10 - 15 points. Another point that Wechsler failed to consider was that statistical analysis shows that differences of 15 points or more between only two subtests will occur on the average of five times in every normal person's record (there are 55 possible inter-test differences). Therefore, unless a person has more than 5 or 6 large inter-test differences it is not possible to determine if he is psychopathological. Wechsler also failed to cross-validate his original findings. When Wechsler compared a pathological sample's test scores to a normal sample's test scores he did not recognize that the differences he found could easily have been attributable to sampling error. When other researchers submitted Wechsler's findings to cross-validation they discovered that Wechsler's initial findings were invalid. Another problem with Wechsler's contentions is that there are other conditions that could have accounted for atypical variations among subtest scores besides psychopathology. Such variations may result not only from pathology but also from differences in educational, occupational, cultural, or other background factors. For example, language handicap due to cultural deprivation could account for lower verbal than performance scores. The diagnostic categories that Wechsler used in his studies were imprecise, unreliable, and somewhat crude. Designations like brain damage and schizophrenia are associated with varied behavior and thus are not always useful in identifying typical test patterns. All in all, it has not proven possible to makepsychiatriatic diagnoses on the basis of intelligence test scores. Since psychopathological behavior is not consistent or specifically identifiable it may not be possible to associate a clinical syndrome with specific test behaviors. Moreover, the relationship between intelligence and personality is elusive at best and it does not seem possible at this time to state with any certainty how personality characteristics interact with intelligence."

Emotional responsivity is not inherited, but learned\nC.             Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions\nD. Heredity has no impact on emotional responsivity\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nResearch has indicated that emotionalresponsivitycan be inherited in animals. Significant differences can be seen in the degree of savageness between wild and domesticated animals. Wild animals such as gray rats, wolves, and lions are innately savage whereas their domesticated counterparts--white rats, dogs, and cats are innately tame. Even if these animals' environments are changed, they still retain their respective potentials for tameness and savageness. A wild animal raised by humans from birth will always remain potentially savage and will never become as tame as a domesticated animal. A domesticated animal released to the wild may become relativity savage, but will remain more \"tamable\" than animals whose ancestors were wild. Several experiments have been conducted to detect emotional inheritance. In one study, Hall (1938) tested the level of emotionality in 145 rats by using a device called an \"open field\"--a large compartment that usually elicits fear. Of these rats, Hall mated 7 of the most emotional females with the 7 most emotional males. Likewise, the 7 least emotional females were mated with the 7 least emotional males. This inbreeding continued for several generations. It was found that the offspring of the emotional rats were a great deal more emotional than the offspring of the unemotional rats. This difference was considerable, even in the first generation of offspring. In Hall's test of emotionalresponsivity, he found that the scores of the emotional offspring were seven times those of the unemotional offspring. The inheritance of emotions has also been studied in humans, although not as extensively as in animals because of practical and ethical considerations. In one experiment,Jostand Sontag (1944) studied children between 6 and 12 years of age over a period of 3 years. The researchers measured various bodily states which are known to at least partly reflect emotion. Among these were skin resistance, pulse and respiration rates, and salivation. For subjects, the researchers chose pairs of identical twins, pairs of siblings, and pairs of unrelated children. They wanted to see whether twins (who have identical heredity) are more similar in emotionalresponsitivity--as reflected in bodily states associated with it--than siblings and unrelated children. Using a correlation coefficient (a number between + 1.00 and - 1.00 used to express the degree of relationship between two sets of measurements arranged in pairs) the researchers combined the correlations of the scores on the different measures of bodily states. It was found that the correlations between identical twins were consistently higher than those for siblings, and the correlations for siblings were higher than those for unrelated children. Overall, the relationships clearly showed that heredity is influential in bodily states associated with emotion.",

If a student strikes up a friendship with a person in his astrology class, it is likely that the next time he wants to discuss astrology, this person will come to mind. The person has many other qualities by which other people relate to him. However, the student's first experience caused him to classify the person in the part of his memory associated with astrology.

Disadvantages: may not accurately measure intelligence\nD. Advantages: provides a universal standard for intelligence. Disadvantages: may favor certain cultures over others\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nRecently, there has been much concern about the fairness of applying available intelligence tests to culturally disadvantaged groups. Culturally disadvantaged means that an individual is not assimilated into or knowledgeable about the culture he is living in. He often comes from another, different culture or is segregated from those cultural groups that dominate the society as a whole. It seems unfair to judge these individuals on the basis of their performances on tests that are inherently \"culturally biased.\" There appears to be no question that IQ tests, achievement tests, and aptitude tests are culturally biased. The mere fact that one needs to be fairly proficient in English language skills to do well on these tests is evidence of cultural bias. Thus, the advantage of developing cross-cultural tests is that it is possible to compensate for the disadvantages many individuals have been subjected to and to measure innate abilities, including general intellectual ability. In this way it is possible to compare people from different cultures fairly on the basis of innate ability. The disadvantage of cross-cultural tests is that the predictive and diagnostic value of the intelligence test is often lost. The most valuable characteristic of the IQ test, especially the Stanford-Binet, is its ability to predict accurately an individual's future academic achievement. There is little gained by administering culture-fair tests if they do not provide useful information. Educators are primarily interested in using IQ tests to identify those students who will have difficulty succeeding within the system, i.e. within the culture. A poor score on an IQ test suggests that an individual may need special assistance if he is to succeed within the culture. Notice that this says little about innate intelligence. The culturally biased information is in a very real sense necessary information for succeeding within the culture. IQ tests, especially the Wechsler series, can also help to pinpoint specific problem areas for individuals. Culture-fair tests may be able to measure some innate ability but this measure is useless in a society where success is dependent on cultural assimilation and knowledge. Thus, the problem is not with IQ tests per se; the problem is with their interpretation. IQ test scores should not be interpreted as being indicative of inherent, unchangeable intellectual differences. IQ scores do predict success within the society.

Aptitude and achievement tests serve the same purpose\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIt is not true that achievement tests measure solely the effects of learning and that aptitude tests measure solely \"innate capacity\" independent of learning. The distinction between aptitude and achievement tests is not absolute; it is a loose distinction. Examiners usually apply the term aptitude to tests which measure the effects of learning under uncontrolled or unknown conditions. Moreover, the people who are taking aptitude tests have not usually undergone a uniform prior experience as have people who are taking \"achievement tests.\" An example of a uniform prior experience is a geometry class; the New York State Regents Examination in geometry is an achievement test given to all who have undergone the uniform prior experience of taking a geometry class in a New York State public high school. The Scholastic Aptitude Tests' (SAT) math section is a math aptitude test because it is administered to students nationwide with a variety of unknown mathematical backgrounds. The respective uses of achievement and aptitude tests are also different. Aptitude tests serve to predict subsequent performance, e.g., to determine if an individual will profit from the education at a particular college, if someone will perform well in a particular training program, etc. Achievement tests, on the other hand, are usually administered after training in order to evaluate what the individual has gained through training. Since achievement tests and aptitude tests have different uses, they are usually validated in different ways. It is most appropriate to use content validity to assess an achievement test because having content validity assures that the test will be measuring an adequate and representative sample of the material covered during training. Criterion- related validity is used to determine if a test will accurately reflect future performance. Therefore, aptitude tests are assessed by criterion-related validity; that is, the test results are checked with a future measure of the same behavior which the test is designed to measure. For example, the SAT is designed to predict college performance; therefore, SAT scores are checked against college grades to make sure that high SAT scores mean that an individual will probably have high college grades. It must be remembered, however, the distinctions between achievement and aptitude tests are not strict. Achievement tests can be used to predict performance. The College Board's (CEEB) Achievement Tests in specific subjects, physics, for example, will predict an individual's future performance in college physics with some degree of accuracy, even though the test was not designed to predict future performance but past achievement.",

Cutaneous receptors, Visceral receptors, Muscle receptors, Joint receptors\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nInformation from the environment (e.g., Is it light or dark outside, did something just fall on your foot, etc...) enters our body through units called sensory receptors. Four basic types of sensory receptors can be distinguished. First, there are receptors that relay information about stimuli that originate outside the body: these are theexteroceptors.Exteroceptorsare classified as distant when the source of stimulation is far removed from the receptor, as when you see a star. They are classified as contact exteroceptorswhen the source of stimulation is in actual physical contact with the receptor, an example being the taste buds in your mouth--you do not taste food until it makes actual contact with the receptors on the tongue. In direct contrast,interoceptorsare sensitive only to internal stimulation that originate within the body itself. They are usually located in the walls of internal organs. In the stomach, for example, they are sensitive to stomach distention (stretching). These receptors are hypothesized to play a role in satiety. Proprioceptors, located in muscles, tendons, and joints, are sensitive to movements of the muscles, tendons, or joints, such as flexion, when a limb is bent. These provide what we call our \"kinesthetic sense\" or sense of motion; they are of much importance in performing complex coordinated activities and in helping us maintain our balance. The fourth class of receptors is concerned with the vestibular senses--those of balance and orientation of the body and head in space. It includes the hair cells of the semicircular canals in the ears, which provide us with information regarding our head position. In summary, the following four classes of receptors were distinguished:exteroceptors, which deal with stimuli originating outside the body,interoceptorswhich deal with stimuli originating within the body, proprioceptorswhich are sensitive to movement of muscles, tendons, or joints, and vestibular receptors, concerned with balance and orientation of head and body in space.",

Associations to pictures are more often related to the active performance with the object in the picture, for example, \"bicycle--ride.\" Whereas the association to the word is more likely to be a category, \"bicycle--transportation.\" Also, the .time it takes for associations to pictures to form is greater than that for words.

Emotional frustrations, spiritual frustrations, and financial frustrations\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nFrustration can be classified into three major categories depending on its source. These are environmental frustrations, personal frustrations, and conflict frustrations. Environmental frustration refers to frustration produced by environmental obstacles blocking the attainment of certain goals. These obstacles may be in the form of objects or people. For example, a flooded road may prevent a driver from reaching his destination and hence produce frustration. People, especially those in positions of authority, are also an important source of frustration, especially for children. Parents, teachers, and legal authoritative figures often prevent others from attaining goals. Personal frustration is the result of being unable to attain learned goals. Learned goals are those which the individual comes to regard as important and desirable as a result of socialization. The individual normally adopts those goals which are shared by most people in his society. These may include high scholastic achievement or a good, high-paying job. An individual may wish to pursue various activities or goals but may refrain feeling he lacks the necessary ability. Frustration results when the person feels his goals or levels of aspiration are too high for his level of performance. Personal frustration is common in both children and adults. Motivational conflict--a conflict of motives--is the most important source of frustration. Conflict frustration commonly results from the individual's desire to engage in a particular activity, but because of societal attitudes or sanctions against that behavior, the person refrains. Hence, we have a conflict of motives. An individual, for example, might like to express his anger by striking the person he is angry at, but will experience conflict because he feels social disapproval will result if he vents his anger. Conflict frustration is the most deep-seated and persistent of the three types of frustration, and is usually the most important source of anxiety.",

The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is probablyfamiliar to everyone: It involves a word or name that one has difficultyretrieving; the search for the word often leaves the person in an uncomfortablestate. The evidence that the person knows the word is two-fold: (a) either the person is eventually successful in retrieving the word, or, (b) if a wrong word is presented, the subject in the tip-of-the-tonguestate is often able to reject it and can explain its similarity withthe target word. Brown and McNeill (1966) studied this phenomenon in a laboratory setting. They read dictionary definitions of somewhat uncommon words to subjectsand asked the subjects to provide the correct word associated withthe definitions Whenever a tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon occurred, thesubject was asked to write down words similar in sound or meaning to thetarget word, the number of syllables, and the initial letter of the word.

Thus, the characteristics of the target word that were recalled by thesubject served as cues in tapping the memory for the eventual retrievalof the word. The more phonetic and semantic features the subject wasable to think of, the more opportunity the subject had to narrow the wordsdown, eventually producing the one that was defined by a particular feature. This experiment provides evidence that people use semantic and phoneticcharacteristics associated with a word for the retrieval process in memory.

A typical information processing sequence model includes stages such as Iconic or echoic storage, Image representation or encoding, Short-term memory storage, and Long-term memory storage.\nB. Information processing model consists of input and output only.\nC.             Information processing model doesn't include short-term memory.\nD. Information processing sequence model only includes hearing and visual senses.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThere are many highly sophisticated information processing models available. The following is a brief and general outline of the major stages that might be included in a typical model that explains how the human perceptual and cognitive systems process the flow of stimulation from the environment. Stage 1: Iconic or echoic storage. This stage represents a fleeting experience that is of great importance in the study of information processing. In the visual realm the iconic image is that which occurs during a single glance. Usually lasting approximately 1/15 of a second, iconic storage consists of a series of successive glances each representing a small section of a larger object. In hearing, the duration of different echoic codes are less distinct, but each is a sample of a larger auditory event. Stage 2: Image representation or encoding. The momentary sensory experience provides an abundance of information that when combined with other experiences can lead to the recognition of a particular image or sound. For example, momentary glances provide color, texture, density, movement and shape. At stage two this information would be examined and compared. Essential features would be extracted so that the pattern might be recognized as the word \"car.\" By the encoding of this word, other information such as color, brightness and shape can be discarded. Stage 3: Storage: Short-term memory. It is here that the encoded information resides until it can combine with information coming from the next moment or until it can be transferred to long-term memory. Short-term memory has a limited capacity; it can usually store up to about 8 items. Stage 4: Storage: Long-term memory. Not all information is finally stored in long-term memory. But whatever memory is not within short-term memory can be said to be in long-term memory where it is available for use as needed. Attention processes play an important role in determining whether information will be transferred from short to long-term memory.",

                "solution": "There are many highly sophisticated information processing models available. The following is a brief and general outline of the major stages that might be included in a typical model that explains how the human perceptual and cognitive systems process the flow of stimulation from the environment. Stage 1: Iconic or echoic storage. This stage represents a fleeting experience that is of great importance in the study of information processing. In the visual realm the iconic image is that which occurs during a single glance. Usually lasting approximately 1/15 of a second, iconic storage consists of a series of successive glances each representing a small section of a larger object. In hearing, the duration of different echoic codes are less distinct, but each is a sample of a larger auditory event. Stage 2: Image representation or encoding. The momentary sensory experience provides an abundance of information that when combined with other experiences can lead to the recognition of a particular image or sound. For example, momentary glances provide color, texture, density, movement and shape. At stage two this information would be examined and compared. Essential features would be extracted so that the pattern might be recognized as the word \"car.\" By the encoding of this word, other information such as color, brightness and shape can be discarded. Stage 3: Storage: Short-term memory. It is here that the encoded information resides until it can combine with information coming from the next moment or until it can be transferred to long-term memory. Short-term memory has a limited capacity; it can usually store up to about 8 items. Stage 4: Storage: Long-term memory. Not all information is finally stored in long-term memory. But whatever memory is not within short-term memory can be said to be in long-term memory where it is available for use as needed. Attention processes play an important role in determining whether information will be transferred from short to long-term memory."

            "text": "Question:\nWhen an adult mouse or bird is castrated, its sexual behavior virtually disappears. Compare the effects of castration of highly developed primates with the less developed animals.\n\nOptions:\nA. In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.\nB. Primates can't learn sexual behavior through experience\nC.             Castration affects the ability to perform sexual acts in all animals\nD. Castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nIn simple behavior, animals respond to a particular stimulus in the environment with an appropriate response. However, few animals respond so automatically; stereotyped behavior can be modified. Sometimes the animal does not respond; sometimes it responds differently than expected. Its actions often depend on other controlling factors, such as hormone levels and previous experience. This question involves the use of these two factors in modifying sexual behavior. Hormones modify behavior by affecting the level of an animal's motivational state. They alter the animal's physiology, which can then alter behavioral patterns. For example, the breeding term in birds is initiated by physiological changes in the reproductive organs which produce the sex hormones. These sex hormones cause the development of special breeding plumage which subsequently affects reproductive behavior. The male hormones also induce courtship displays like bowing and cooing upon sight of the female. The female responds to these courting displays by the release of its own reproductive hormones which affect egg production. Eventually nest building occurs and copulation results. In each step of this reproductive behavior, hormones lead to behavior acts which cause further release of other hormones directing further behavior. However, as animals have evolved, there is less hormone-directed behavior, and more learned responses. Learning is the change in behavior as a result of experience. Only higher animals with larger and more complex brains demonstrate the process of learning. Learning affects man's behavior, very little of which is stereotyped. In man, hormones play a minor role in modifying behavior; learning plays a major role. When a mouse is castrated (testes removed), it can no longer produce any male reproductive hormones. As in the bird, these hormones are necessary for the reproductive behavior of the mouse. Removal of the hormones thus causes the sexual behavior of the mouse to decline and eventually disappear. The mouse apparently cannot learn its sexual behavior. In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced. This is because the behavior has been learned through experience.",
