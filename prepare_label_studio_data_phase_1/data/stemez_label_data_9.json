At high altitudes, the percentage of nitrogen in air increases\nB. At high altitudes, the amount of hemoglobin in blood decreases\nC.             At high altitudes, the barometric pressure and the partial pressure of oxygen decrease, leading to less saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen, causing hypoxia, or deficiency of oxygen at the tissue level.\nD. At high altitudes, the percentage of carbon dioxide in air increases\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nBarometric pressure progressively decreases as altitude increases. The air is still 21% oxygen, but the partial pressure of oxygen decreases along with barometric pressure. At sea level, the barometric pres-sure is 760 mm Hg, and thus, the partial pressure of O_2 is about 160 mm Hg. Arterial blood, under these conditions, contains nearly fully saturated hemoglobin . At an alti-tude of 9000 ft. the barometric pressure is about 525 mm Hg, and thus, the partial pressure of oxygen is 110 mm Hg. Under these conditions, there is only 90% saturation of the hemoglobin in arterial blood . It must be understood that 90% saturation does not mean that some hemoglobin molecules are carrying less than four O_2 (recall that each hemoglobin molecule binds four O_2 molecules). The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative; that is, the binding of the first oxygen molecule facilitates the binding of the second molecule, which in turn makes it easier to bind the third molecule, and so on. Therefore, through cooperative binding, a hemoglobin molecule binds four O_2 or none at all, and 90% saturation means that 10% of the hemoglobin molecules have no oxygen bound to them at all. The higher the al-titude, the lower the percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen. Thus at high altitudes, hypoxia, or the deficiency of oxygen at the tissue level, becomes a problem. The effects of oxygen deprivation vary with indi-viduals. Most persons who ascend rapidly to altitudes of about 10,000 ft. experience breathlessness , nausea, fatigue, decreased mental proficiency, and ultimately become comatose if the lack of oxygen is too severe. These symptoms will disappear if an individual remains at high altitudes for several days, but full physical capacity will be diminished. The initial acute responses to high altitudes are increased rate and depth of breathing, increased cardiac output and increased heart rate. The latter increases the rate and volume of blood flow to the alveoli,enhancing enhancing CO_2 and O_2 exchange and insuring enough oxygen for every cell. As ventilation increases, thereby in-creasing the oxygen supply, the heart rate returns to normal. During this same time, erythrocyte and hemoglobin syntheses are stimulated by erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidney . Consequently, the total circu-lating red cell mass increases considerably . The produc-tion of more red cells, and the synthesis of more hemoglobin together compensate for the low partial pres-sure of oxygen. There are now more cells transporting oxygen, although each cell is carrying less oxygen than at atmospheric pressure. Compared to the rapid increases in respiratory rate and heart rate, erythropoiesis is a slow process. A second adap-tation of the body to an even greater altitude involves an increase in capillaries. The mechanism that stimulates the growth of new capillaries is unknown, but the result is a decrease in the distance which oxygen must diffuse to reach the tissues. Also, a compound 2,3-DPG increases in red blood cells. DPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen which eases the unloading of oxygen at the cells.

Typhoid fever is character-ized by a fever, inflammation of the intestine, intestinal ulcers, and a toxemia (presence of toxins in the blood). The presence of Salmonella is therefore ample reason for concern. Typhoid fever, like most intestinal infections, is transmitted from one person to another through food and water. Transmission may be indirect . For example, wastes from an infected person can pollute drinking water or food, or the infected person may handle food at some point in its processing or distribution, and contaminate it, af-fecting the consumer. The common housefly can also trans-mitSalmonellafrom wastes to food. Typhoid fever occurs in all parts of the world. In locations where good sanita-tion (proper disposal and treatment of biological waste, and water purification ) is practiced, typhoid fever inci-dence is very low.

The presence of E .coliin the stool should not cause any alarm, since it is one of the many types of bacteria that normally inhabit our intestine. The genusSalmonella, however, includes several species which are pathogenic to man and other animals.Salmonellatyphi, for example, causes the acute infectious disease known as typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is character-ized by a fever, inflammation of the intestine, intestinal ulcers, and a toxemia (presence of toxins in the blood). The presence of Salmonella is therefore ample reason for concern. Typhoid fever, like most intestinal infections, is transmitted from one person to another through food and water. Transmission may be indirect . For example, wastes from an infected person can pollute drinking water or food, or the infected person may handle food at some point in its processing or distribution, and contaminate it, af-fecting the consumer. The common housefly can also trans-mitSalmonellafrom wastes to food. Typhoid fever occurs in all parts of the world. In locations where good sanita-tion (proper disposal and treatment of biological waste, and water purification ) is practiced, typhoid fever inci-dence is very low. Carriers are people who are infected withSalmonellatyphi, but who have had only a slight intestinal infection, and hence do not knowthayharbor the pathogenic organism. Carriers should not be allowed to handle or prepare food ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nIn the popular nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\", her lambwould follow Mary wherever she went.

Viruses have the same metabolic machinery as cells\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAll living things possess organization. The fundamental unit of organization is the cell. Living cells are variably bounded by a membrane, which regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell. Viruses do not have any membranes because they have no need to take in or expel material. Viruses lack all metabolic machinery while cells possess this machinery in order to extract energy from theenviromentto synthesize their components. All cells produce ATP but viruses do not. Cells utilize ATP to build complex materials and to sustain active in- teractions with their environment. Viruses do not perform energy-requiring processes . Cells are capable of growth in size but viruses do not have this capacity . Most living things respond in complex ways to physical or chemical changes in their environment. Viruses do not. Most importantly, livingthinqspossess the cellular machinery necessary for reproduction. They have a complete system for transcribing and translating the messages coded in their DNA. Viruses do not have this system . Although they do possess either RNA or DNA (cells possess both ) they cannot independently reproduce, but must rely on host cells for reproductive machinery and components. Viruses use their host's ribosomes , enzymes, nucleotides, and amino acids to produce the nucleic acids and proteins needed to make new viral particles. They cannot reproduce on their own. However, viruses are unlike non-living things in that they possess the potentiality for reproduction.

Increasing water intake to counteract dehydration\nD. Administering glucose to increase blood sugar levels\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nDiabetes mellitus is a disease which results from a hyposecretion of insulin. Insulin stimulates glu-cose uptake by all cells with the exception of brain cells. Hyposecretion of insulin reduces the cellular uptake of glucose, leading to an accumulation of glucose in the blood. The blood glucose may rise to such a level that a good deal of it cannot be reabsorbed by the kidney tubules. When this happens the level of glucose excreted into the urine increases tremendously. The osmotic force exerted by glucose in the urine retains water and prevents its reabsorption. Thus, the volume of water excreted is also abnormally high in people with diabetes. This loss of wa-ter, if sufficiently great, can ultimately reduce blood pres-sure to such an extent that there is a marked decrease in blood flow to the brain, resulting in coma and possibly death. In our specific example, coma is induced by the afore-mentioned means. Emotional stress stimulates the release of glucose from the liver through the action of epinephrine, thereby resulting in a rapid increase in blood glucose.In the case of a person with diabetes, this increased blood glucose results in a large amount of water loss, which in turn leads to a decreased blood pressure. Blood flow to the brain is reduced owing to the drop in blood pressure. Coma usually results as blood supply to the brain cells becomes insufficient. Insulin should be given as treatment for this comatose person. Insulin will stimulate glucose uptake, thereby reducing its level in the blood. Glucose concentration in the urine subsequently declines, and water loss is diminished. The pressure of the blood is thereby restored to normal. It is important to note that the dosage of insulin injected is critical. If an overdose of insulin is ad-ministered, the situation is equally fatal had no insulin been injected. This is because insulin cannot enter the brain, and hence the brain cells will not alter their rate of glucose uptake. Thus they are greatly dependent on the blood supply for glucose to maintain their energy metabolism. When too much insulin is given to the diabetic, his blood stream is essentially depleted of glucose units which have entered most of the body cells excepting the brain cells.

Theprotozoansare grouped into the phylum Protozoa within the Animal Kingdom, although this classification remains controversial. Some biologists still believe that theprotozoanshave more in common with the KingdomProtista. Protozoa live either singly or in colonies. These organisms are usually said to be unicellular.

Certainprotozoans have interesting plant-like characteristics in both structure and physiology. Reproduction among theprotozoansis variable. An individual may divide into two, usually equal halves, after which each grows to the original size and form. This form of reproduction is called binary fission and can be seen in the flagellates, among the ciliates, and in organisms such as the amoeba. Multiple fission, orsporulation, where the nucleus divides repeatedly and the cytoplasm becomes differentiated simultaneously around each nucleus resulting in the production of a number of offspring, is also seen among theprotozoans.

Budding is another reproductive process by which a new individual arises as an outgrowth from the parent organism differentiating before or after it becomes free. All thereproductorymechanisms thus far mentioned illustrate asexual means of reproduction. Sexual reproduction may also occur by the fusion of two cells, called gametes, to form a new individual, or by the temporary contact and nuclear exchange (conjugation) of two protozoans (for example, two paramecia).

Large size and complex structure\nD. High metabolic rate and rapid multiplication\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAmong the major characteristics of bacterial cells are their shape, arrangement, and size. These characteristics constitute the morphology of the bacterial cell. Although there are thousands of different species of bacteria, the cells of most bacteria have one of three fundamental shapes: (1) spherical or ellipsoidal, (2) cylindrical or rodlike, and (3) spiral or helically coiled. Spherical bacterial cells are called cocci (singular, coccus). Many of these bacteria form patterns of arrangement which can be used for identification. These patterns can be explained by peculiarities in the multiplication processes of the different bacteria. For example, diplococcal cells divide to form pairs. Streptococcal cells remain attached after dividing and form chains. Staphylococci divide three dimensionally to form irregular clusters of cocci, resembling bunches of grapes. Each of the cells in a diplococcal, streptococcal, or staphylococcal aggregate is an independent organism. Cylindrical or rod like bacterial cells are called bacilli (singular, bacillus). These do not form as wide a variety of arrangements as do cocci, but occasionally they are found in pairs or chains. These patterns do not arise from the multiplication process, but only from the particular stage of growth or growth conditions present, and hence bacilli usually appear as single, unattached cells. There are many variations in the thickness and length of these rod like bacteria. Spiral-shaped bacterial cells are called spirilla (singular, spirillum). Like the bacilli, they usually occur as unattached, individual cells. The spirilla exhibit considerable differences in length and in the frequency and amplitude of the spirals. The average bacterial cell has dimensions of approximately 0.5 to 1.0 \\mum by 2.0 to 5.0 \\mum. (\\mum is the abbreviation for micrometer, which is 1/1000 of a millimeter or 10^-6 meter.) An important consequence of the very small size of a bacterial cell is that the ratio of surface area to volume is extremely high. This ratio allows a very large portion of the bacterial cell to be in contact with its environment.The result is that bacteria are able to rapidly ingest nutrients and growth factors and excrete wastes; their metabolic rate is correspondingly high. This high metabolic rate enables bacteria both to adjust to and to introduce changes in their environment in very short periods of time. These changes may be beneficial to the bacteria producing them, or to other species of bacteria. For instance, the release of carbon dioxide by certain bacteria increases the acidity of the growth medium and favors the growth of bacteria requiring a low pH environment. The most important factor involved in the ability of bacteria to alter their environment is their ability to multiply rapidly. Within the multitudes of bacteria produced by a newly settled bacterium there will be a handful of mutants. Natural selection may allow one of these mutants to be most fit for survival in the changing environment and numerous offspring will be derived from it.

This psychological state can lead to antisocial behavior. Researchers of this phenomenon believe thatdeindividuation results from feelings of anonymity, lessened responsibility and arousal. Working from the premise that a large city would produce more anonymity and a lessened sense of responsibility than a smaller city, Zimbardoconducted an identical experiment in New York City and in Palo Alto, California. He placed an apparently abandoned car with the license plates removed and the hood raised on streets in the two cities, and then he and his associates hid in order to observe people's reactions. In New York, within ten minutes a man, woman and child about nine years old came by, and immediately began to remove parts of the car. Within twenty-four hours the car was completely ransacked, the tires were slashed, the windows broken, the doors beaten in. In Palo Alto, the scene was a different one. After seventy-two hours the car remained untouched, except for one passer-by who politely put the hood down when it began to rain. This experiment supported the hypothesis that the anonymity of a large city gave rise to anti-social behavior. The chances of a person being recognized by someone in a city with a population of 8 million is much less than in a city with a population of 100,000. In a large city there is also a norm of noninvolvement which the New York City vandals probably recognized: people do not get involved in other people's affairs. By the way, the vandals in the New York City experiment were not gangs as might be expected but were most often well-dressed adults. There is, however, also evidence that proves that group membership does contribute todeindividuationand subsequent anti-social behavior. It increases a sense of anonymity, gives an individual a feeling of having less responsibility for his or her actions, and the presence of others creates greater arousal. One Halloween experiment demonstrates: Trick-or-treaters are shown into the dining room after they ring the bell, where they see a table with two large bowls--one full of candy and the other with coins. They are told to take one piece of candy; then the adults leave the room. Of the children who came into the dining room with a group of others, over 60% either took more than one piece of candy or some of the coins.

Apparently, the presence of a group lessened personal responsibility, and in some cases, presented behavior to imitate. Eighty-five percent of the children modeled the first child that approached the table. If he or she committed a transgression (took money or extra candy) the others did also. To test the role anonymity played in the children's behavior, half the children who entered the house were asked their names and addresses, the others were asked nothing. The names and addresses were slowly repeated by the adults. Almost three times as many unidentified children took more candy or money than those who had identified themselves, whether they were in a group or not.

Psychoanalysis and client-centered therapy\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nPsychotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for neuroses. Although there are different forms of psychotherapy, a major prerequisite formost is the establishment of an interpersonal relationship between the therapistand patient. Psychoanalysis, as developed by Freud, is the classic form of psychotherapy. As is seen in the description of the genetic hypothesis of symptomsubstitution, Freud contended that all neuroses could be traced torepressed conflicts experienced in infancy and early childhood. To determinethe nature of the repressed conflict the patient engages in the processof free association. Free association is the means by which repressedconflicts are brought into the consciousness. The analyst is trainedto know which parts of the free association are symbols for the innerconflict. As therapy progresses a relationship known as \"transference\" develops whereby the therapist replaces the parental figures, thus enabling the patient to resolve childhood conflicts.

Although there are different forms of psychotherapy, a major prerequisite formost is the establishment of an interpersonal relationship between the therapistand patient. Psychoanalysis, as developed by Freud, is the classic form of psychotherapy. As is seen in the description of the genetic hypothesis of symptomsubstitution, Freud contended that all neuroses could be traced torepressed conflicts experienced in infancy and early childhood. To determinethe nature of the repressed conflict the patient engages in the processof free association. Free association is the means by which repressedconflicts are brought into the consciousness. The analyst is trainedto know which parts of the free association are symbols for the innerconflict. As therapy progresses a relationship known as \"transference\" develops whereby the therapist replaces the parental figures, thus enabling the patient to resolve childhood conflicts.

To aid in quicker, more reliable classifications, the American Psychiatric Association outlined the symptom types of neuroses into seven kinds of reactions. As in all psychological diagnosis, it is rare to find an individual who fits neatly into one classification area. Most individuals tend to exhibit multiple symptoms, usually with one being more dominant than the others. Anxiety reaction is usually characterized by a free-floating anxiety which lends itself to feelings of insecurity and fear for no apparent reason. Increased sensitivity to external stimuli, rapid pulse rate and insomnia are also related symptoms of the anxiety reaction. Phobic reactions are irrational but very real fears. Although the individual knows what he is afraid of, the cause is not as evident. The danger in phobic reaction is that they may expand to include more and more fears, thus incapacitating the individual. If the individual is fortunate, the phobia will direct itself at something which is easily avoided. Depressive reactions are characterized by feelings of uselessness, apathy, and a lack of self-worth. Physical reactions include a lack of energy and constant lethargy. The persistence of this reaction distinguishes it from normal bouts of depression. Such a reaction is difficult to treat because the symptoms extend themselves to inhibit the motivation required to enter and complete therapy. Dissociative reactions are always characterized by a loss of personal identity. In most instances the patient selectively chooses to forget about things associated with the original conflict. In an extreme dissociative reaction the individual develops amnesia. It is rare that an individual will take on a \"new\" identity to replace the lost one but it is possible.

The experiment is usually considered the best method for studying causal relationships between events. In an experiment, two groups are chosen randomly. One is designated to be experimentally manipulated (the treatment, condition, that is to be evaluated) while the other condition, called the control group, does not receive the experimental manipulation. The control subjects serve as a basis for comparison. In this way, causes of any changes that occur during the experiment to the first group can be distinctly attributed to the experimental condition. Of course, there are many complex issues involved in experimental design. These will be covered in another chapter. Using an experiment to study abnormal psychology is quite often not possible due to ethical considerations. It would be highly unethical to create abnormal behavior in human subjects in order to obtain knowledge of its causes.Correlationalstudies are often used as a less than perfect alternative. Here, the main concern is the relationship of one variable with another. For example, height and weight are usually positively correlated, i.e. tall people tend to be heavier than short people. To obtain this correlation methodically, pairs of observations (such as height and weight of numerous individuals) are obtained. In abnormal psychology it is possible to determine the relationship between social class and schizophrenia, for example. However, even if an extremely high positive correlation between lower class individuals and schizophrenia were found, i.e. if it were found that schizophrenics had a very strong tendency to be from the lower classes, it could not be stated that one is the cause of the other. Hence the axiom \"correlation does not imply causation.\" This is the main drawback tocorrelationalstudies, as the knowledge obtainable from any one study is strictly limited. In a research method called mixed design, experimental and correlationaltechniques are combined. The purpose of a mixed design study is to identify precisely to which subjects the experimental condition can best be applied. The different types of populations used are considered thecorrelationalaspects of the study, while the applied conditions or treatments are the experimental factors.

Generally, the subject is observed, the subject's experience is manipulated by the experimenter (the experimental condition) and then the subject is observed again in the \"precondition state.\" If the subject's behavior returns to the pre-condition state, it is assumed that the experimental manipulation produced the change.

Sex role learning is only learned.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nAs in most areas of human development, the acquirement of appropriate sex role behavior is both genetically determined and learned. Psychologists, however, have only recently acknowledged this view as plausible. Many sex differences which we now know to be learned were at one time thought to be inherited. The psychological viewpoint has undergone a marked shift from a biological determinist view to a more environmentalist one. Still, sex role characteristics which are inherited cannot be overlooked. In every animal species, males behave differently from females. Harlow (1962), for example, found that young male monkeys engage in rough play more frequently than female monkeys. Young, Goy, and Phoenix (1964) found that young female monkeys, whose mothers were injected with the male hormone immediately before birth, were more rough or \"masculine\" in their play. Psychology offers two theories to account for sex role learning. One theory is based upon the principle of reinforcement. Children are rewarded for behaving in a mode which is considered appropriate for their particular sex and are punished for inappropriate behavior. The other theory is based upon imitation and identification with the same-sexed parent. The child adopts the behavior patterns of the parent of the same sex and becomes as masculine or feminine as the parent. Because reinforcement and imitation are both processes of socialization, sex role learning is a type of socialization.

The development of sex-related behavior is also dependent upon the parents' interaction with their children. In the United States, sex-stereotyping is common. It begins at birth with the sending of blue cards to announce the birth of a male child and pink cards to herald the arrival of a female. Several studies have indicated that there are marked differences between the way that parents interact with male and female children. For example, three psychologists from Tufts University administered questionnaires to parents of newborn babies. The questionnaire asked them to rate their child on such qualities as size, skin texture, temperament, etc. The study indicated that parents of daughters considered their children to be smaller, softer, and more delicate than parents of males. In another study, two groups of mothers were chosen to interact or play with a 6-month-old boy. The infant was presented to the first group of mothers dressed as a boy, but he was presented to the second group of mothers dressed as a girl. The mothers who thought that the child was a girl smiled at him more than the other group of mothers.

Erikson's stages are: (1) oral-sensory, (2) muscular-anal, (3) locomotor-genital, (4) latency, (5) adolescence, (6) young adulthood, (7) adulthood, and (8) maturity.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nErik Erikson, an American psychoanalyst, devised a comprehensive theory for explaining psychosocial development. He believes that human behavior and personality result from a combination of heredity and cultural influences. He divides development from birth to maturity into eight basic stages. Each stage consists of a crisis which indicates a major turning point in the individual's life. This conflict is usually one between individual instinct and the restraining forces of external institutions. The individual must decide between two alternatives--one that is beneficial and another that is detrimental. Success in development is dependent upon successfully choosing the right alternative. Erikson's stages are: (1) oral-sensory (birth to one-and-a-half years), (2) muscular-anal (one-and-a-half to four years), (3) locomotor-genital (four to six years), (4) latency (six to eleven years), (5) adolescence, (6) young adulthood, (7) adulthood, and (8) maturity. During the first stage, the oral-sensory stage, the basic crisis centers on the development of either trust or mistrust. An infant is almost completely dependent on others for the fulfillment of his needs. If these needs are consistently satisfied and if he receives love and stimulation with those he comes in contact with, he will develop a sense of trust, not only in others but in himself and in his ability to handle his needs. If, on the other hand, his needs are not satisfied regularly and he receives little love, attention and stimulation, he will develop a sense of mistrust. If the mistrust is severe, the child may become timid and withdrawn since he has given up hope of ever achieving his goals. Erikson believes that the development of a healthy personality is contingent upon the formation of a basic trust--the individual's belief that his existence is meaningful. The second stage of psychosocial development, according to Erikson, is the muscular-anal which occurs in early childhood. During this period, the basic crisis is between establishing autonomy and dealing with doubt and shame. The child who has developed a healthy sense of basic trust begins to see himself as a separate and autonomous being capable of doing things for himself. He has now gained some control of his bodily functions. He begins to assert himself, as can be seen in his response when asked to do something--he'11 often reply, \"no.\" Erikson believes parents should allow small children to do some things for themselves and should encourage exploration so that the child can develop a sense of autonomy or separateness. In addition, parents should assist their child in acquiring bodily control in such activities as walking and bowel movement. Erikson contends that if parents are overprotective of their child (i.e., if they don't let him do things for himself), and are over-demanding with regard to his bodily functions, the child will develop feelings of shame and selfdoubt. He will be shameful of not living up to his parents' expectations and will doubt his ability to live as a free, autonomous being. Individuals who successfully pass through this stage develop into independent adults who are able to make decisions for themselves and guide their own lives. The third stage of Erikson's theory is called the locomotor-genital stage, which occurs between the ages of four to six. This period is characterized by the formation of either initiative or guilt, the development of motor skills resulting in increased locomotion, increase in language development as well as imagination and curiosity. Curiosity is especially evident in the child as reflected by his interest in exploring his (and others') bodies and differences between males and females. Erikson maintains that this interest is part of an \"infantile sexuality.\" This includes an attraction to the opposite-sexed parent. (Note Freud's influence.) The parent's response to the child's curiosity is an important factor in determining the degree of confidence and initiative the child will develop. A basic sense of guilt emerges if the child receives a negative or indifferent parental response to his questions or if he finds himself in an environment with little to explore. He may become anxious about asking questions and thereby stifle his curiosity. A child who receives positive and attentive parental response will develop a sense of confidence and initiative. He will feel happy and secure about his curiosity and will be eager to explore his environment. Successful resolution of this \"initiative vs. guilt\" crisis enables the child to take initiative and use his imagination in adulthood. He is equipped to deal with new, unfamiliar situations without the restrictions that result from guilt feelings. The fourth stage in Erikson's scheme is called latency which occurs from ages six to eleven. The basic crisis in this period is industry vs. inferiority. A child develops a sense of industry if he receives attention and praise for various accomplishments. For example, his parents might praise him for drawing a picture well or receiving a good report card or his teacher might commend him for writing the best composition in the class. As a result of such reactions, the child will actively pursue various projects since feedback from others assure him he can successfully execute them. In contrast, a child who fails consistently at various tasks or who receives little or no attention and praise develops a sense of inferiority. He avoids tackling new projects because he feels he will not handle them successfully. He puts little effort and enthusiasm into his work because he believes he is bound to fail. A child who successfully resolves this crisis and develops a sense of industry will come to find enjoyment in his work and will experience a sense of pride in his accomplishments. This attitude is carried into adulthood. During this stage the child comes to define himself and others in terms of occupations--doctors, lawyers, teachers. The child defines his future self in terms of one such occupation. Erikson's fifth stage of psychosocial development is adolescence which begins at puberty. The major problem in this stage is the identity crisis. The adolescent keeps asking, \"Who am I?\" Confusion about his role can cause him much stress and anxiety. According to Erikson, the adolescent is very fickle about his self- image. This is reflected in constant fluctuations in preferred tastes and in styles of dress and haircut. In an effort to offset confusion and allay some anxiety, the adolescent may align himself with an individual or group that can provide simple answers to his questions. In his quest for stability, he may devote himself to the guidelines of a teenage gang, a religious group or a political organization. Adopting a lifestyle defined by others and living by others' codes may, however, produce some resentment. He may come to feel that he wants to do what he wants. If, however, the adolescent can't decide what he wants to do, he returns to the identity crisis. Resolution of the identity crisis occurs when the adolescent receives support from others and is encouraged to seek answers to questions on his own. If he experiments with various lifestyles, he will eventually find one that best suits him. In some cultures, such experimentation usually lasts until the individual reaches his mid-twenties. Successful resolution of the identity crisis results in a positive identity wherein the individual is confident of himself and his lifestyle. The sixth stage of Erikson's plan is young adulthood. The basic crisis of this period is intimacy vs. isolation. At this time, the individual is concerned with establishing intimate, long-term relationships with others. If he has successfully resolved the identity crisis, he will be open and warm toward others, willing to share parts of himself and respond to others who wish to share themselves with him. If the identity crisis is not resolved, he will not be willing to open himself up to others. A person with an uncertain or unhealthy identity will not want to share himself with others. Erikson believes that individuals who refrain from intimate relationships do so because they fear the emotional risks involved. To support his statements, he points to hermits who elude intimacy to avoid being hurt and to pseudo-intimates who have many superficial friends but never let anyone get close enough for intimacy to develop. Successful resolution of the crisis in young adulthood leads to a healthy intimacy with another. A successful marriage is evidence of this. The seventh stage of psychosocial development is adulthood. Here, concern for the next generation is of major concern. Having passed the stage of intimacy and concern for only a close few, the individual becomes preoccupied with his children and community. Through such active concern he avoids stagnation because he receives new stimulation in return. Hence, the basic crisis of this stage is generativity vs. stagnation. Success in resolving this crisis is evident in someone who takes an active role in parental guidance of the next generation and in community affairs. The eighth and final stage of Erikson's scheme is maturity. The basic crisis during this stage is ego integrity vs. disgust and despair. A sense of integrity develops if the individual, having looked back on his life, believes it has been meaningful and relatively successful. He feels good about his past and is prepared to live the rest of his life in peace. A feeling of disgust, however, may arise if the individual sees his life as meaningless, wasted, and generally unsuccessful. He will feel despair if he believes it is too late to change or that his personality is so rigid that he can never change it.", "ref_id": 1857, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "List and describe Erikson's stages of psychosocial development.", "options": ["Erikson's stages are: (1) trust vs. mistrust, (2) autonomy vs. shame and doubt, (3) initiative vs. guilt, (4) industry vs. inferiority, (5) identity vs. role confusion, (6) intimacy vs. isolation, (7) generativity vs. stagnation, and (8) ego integrity vs. despair.", "Erikson's stages are: (1) birth to 18 months, (2) 18 months to 3 years, (3) 3 to 5 years, (4) 5 to 12 years, (5) 12 to 18 years, (6) 18 to 40 years, (7) 40 to 65 years, and (8) 65 years and older.", "Erikson's stages are: (1) infancy, (2) toddlerhood, (3) preschool, (4) school age, (5) adolescence, (6) young adulthood, (7) middle adulthood, and (8) late adulthood.", "Erikson's stages are: (1) oral-sensory, (2) muscular-anal, (3) locomotor-genital, (4) latency, (5) adolescence, (6) young adulthood, (7) adulthood, and (8) maturity."], "answer": "D", "solution": "Erik Erikson, an American psychoanalyst, devised a comprehensive theory for explaining psychosocial development.

Discuss three types of social power.\n\nOptions:\nA. Three types of social power are coercive social power, economic social power, and political social power\nB. Social power is the ability to change the social status of an individual\nC.             Social power is the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual. Three types of social power are legitimate social power, referent social power, and reward or coercive social power.\nD. Social power is the ability to control the economic status of an individual\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nAfter the great experiments by Asch andSherifestablished that people do conform, researchers began to try and determine why. One of the most common explanations is based on the concept of social power. Social power is the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual. There are several different types of social power which have been postulated and studied extensively by French and Raven. The most complex form of social power is \"legitimate\" social power in which an individual obeys a person or group because of the power legitimately vested in that person. Obeying a police officer or a court order are examples of being influenced by legitimate social power. Many questions have been raised as to how far this type of power can be allowed to go, particularly in light of the horrors of Nazi Germany. Millions of Jews were murdered by order of the Fuhrer--the legitimate source of social power. Experiments on typical middle-class Americans (Milgram) have also indicated that this tendency to obey a legitimate source of power, even to the point of inflicting harm on others, is alarmingly strong. While legitimate social power is necessary for a society to function effectively, the exercise of individual conscience must be encouraged as an equal value to obedience to social power sources. Another type of social power, \"referent\" social power, is an individual's or group's ability to control the behavior of a person or group based on the desire of the person or group to identify with that source of power. This type of social influence depends on a person's own desire to gain satisfaction or approval or personal identity. The member of the motorcycle gang continues to wear his black leather jacket with the red eagle even when he is no longer with his companions because his identity is connected with being recognized as part of the group. The doctor answers the call over the loud speaker for a doctor to come for emergency help, even though he is on his vacation and has vowed to not work; his idea of the appropriate behavior for a person in his position--the role of a doctor--is to be ever ready to respond to the health needs of other people. This demonstrates the power of the reference group to influence behavior through the identification process. A third type of social power is \"reward\" or \"coercive\" social power. This is the ability to influence a person's behavior through having control of the rewards or punishments the person could receive. A child-parent relation is a classic example of this type of social power at work. Groups, when administering rewards and punishments to both compliant and deviant behavior can use quite subtle methods. Reward can take the form of receiving positive regard and acceptance from the group members, being made to feel comfortable, being given high status and attention.

Discuss three types of social power.", "options": ["Three types of social power are coercive social power, economic social power, and political social power", "Social power is the ability to change the social status of an individual", "Social power is the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual. Three types of social power are legitimate social power, referent social power, and reward or coercive social power.", "Social power is the ability to control the economic status of an individual"], "answer": "C", "solution": "After the great experiments by Asch andSherifestablished that people do conform, researchers began to try and determine why. One of the most common explanations is based on the concept of social power. Social power is the ability to change the attitudes or behavior of an individual. There are several different types of social power which have been postulated and studied extensively by French and Raven. The most complex form of social power is \"legitimate\" social power in which an individual obeys a person or group because of the power legitimately vested in that person. Obeying a police officer or a court order are examples of being influenced by legitimate social power. Many questions have been raised as to how far this type of power can be allowed to go, particularly in light of the horrors of Nazi Germany. Millions of Jews were murdered by order of the Fuhrer--the legitimate source of social power. Experiments on typical middle-class Americans (Milgram) have also indicated that this tendency to obey a legitimate source of power, even to the point of inflicting harm on others, is alarmingly strong. While legitimate social power is necessary for a society to function effectively, the exercise of individual conscience must be encouraged as an equal value to obedience to social power sources. Another type of social power, \"referent\" social power, is an individual's or group's ability to control the behavior of a person or group based on the desire of the person or group to identify with that source of power. This type of social influence depends on a person's own desire to gain satisfaction or approval or personal identity. The member of the motorcycle gang continues to wear his black leather jacket with the red eagle even when he is no longer with his companions because his identity is connected with being recognized as part of the group. The doctor answers the call over the loud speaker for a doctor to come for emergency help, even though he is on his vacation and has vowed to not work; his idea of the appropriate behavior for a person in his position--the role of a doctor--is to be ever ready to respond to the health needs of other people. This demonstrates the power of the reference group to influence behavior through the identification process. A third type of social power is \"reward\" or \"coercive\" social power. This is the ability to influence a person's behavior through having control of the rewards or punishments the person could receive. A child-parent relation is a classic example of this type of social power at work. Groups, when administering rewards and punishments to both compliant and deviant behavior can use quite subtle methods. Reward can take the form of receiving positive regard and acceptance from the group members, being made to feel comfortable, being given high status and attention. Punishment might take the form of being ostracized, ignored, ridiculed, rejected or being given low status. Though these forms of social power may appear distinctly different, people usually conform because an agent has more than one form of social power."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nIf you rub your eyes long and hard enough, you would eventuallysee some type of visual pattern.

The six major categories of abnormal behavior in DSM-II are mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, personality disorders and other nonpsychotic mental disorders, and psychophysiological disorders.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe 1968 manual of the American Psychiatric Association lists the following general categories of abnormal behavior: (1) mental retardation, (2) organic brain syndromes, (3) psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, (5) personality disorders and othernonpsychotic mental disorders, and (6)psychophysiologicaldisorders. Mental retardation is defined as subnormal intellectual functioning associated with impairments in learning, social adjustment, and maturation. The impairment may be caused by one of several factors such as infection, gross brain disease, chromosomal abnormality, and environmental deprivation. There are various degrees of retardation, ranging from borderline to profound. Organic brain syndromes are mental disorders in which intellectual or emotional functioning or both are impaired through a dysfunction of the brain. Intelligence, memory, and affect may be affected by brain dysfunction. Within this category, a distinction is made between psychotic andnonpsychoticdisorders. A psychotic organic brain syndrome (also referred to as an organic psychosis) impairs mental functioning to such a degree that the individual is seriously out of contact with reality. Brain dysfunctions that are not severe enough to produce behavior categorized as psychotic constitutenonpsychoticbrain syndromes. Psychoses not attributed to physical conditions (sometimes called functional psychoses) are defined in the same way as psychoses attributable to brain dysfunctions. The important difference is that they are not considered to be caused by the physical conditions that produce organic brain syndromes. Included in this category are schizophrenia, the major affective disorders, and paranoid states. Neuroses comprise another general category of abnormal behavior. The principal characteristic of a neurosis is conscious or unconscious anxiety. There are no gross distortions of reality and the personality is not significantly altered. Personality disorders and certain othernonpsychoticdisorders are a fifth category of abnormal behavior in DSM-II. Personality disorders are defined as deeply ingrained maladaptive patterns of behavior that are different from those observed in psychoses and neuroses. Included in this category are motivational and social maladjustments such as sexual deviations, drug dependencies, and alcoholism. In addition, many disorders included in the psychotic and neurotic categories are found within this category in their less severe forms. For example, within this general category are subcategories such as paranoid personality (distinguished from psychotic paranoia) and obsessive-compulsive personality (distinguished from an obsessive-compulsive neurosis). Psychophysiologicaldisorders are characterized by physical symptoms produced in part by emotional factors. Various organ systems may be affected. For example, the respiratory system may be debilitated by asthma, the cardiovascular system by high blood pressure, the gastrointestinal system by ulcers, the genitourinary system by impotency, and the skin by hives.", "ref_id": 1878, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Briefly describe the six major categories of abnormal behavior as given in the 1968 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II) of the American Psychiatric Association.", "options": ["The six categories are psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders, mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, and mood disorders.", "DSM-II categorizes abnormal behavior into neuroses, personality disorders, psychoses, cognitive disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders.", "DSM-II divides abnormal behavior into organic brain syndromes, mental disorders, psychoses, neuroses, personality disorders, and sociocultural disorders.", "The six major categories of abnormal behavior in DSM-II are mental retardation, organic brain syndromes, psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, personality disorders and other nonpsychotic mental disorders, and psychophysiological disorders."], "answer": "D", "solution": "The 1968 manual of the American Psychiatric Association lists the following general categories of abnormal behavior: (1) mental retardation, (2) organic brain syndromes, (3) psychoses not attributed to physical conditions, neuroses, (5) personality disorders and othernonpsychotic mental disorders, and (6)psychophysiologicaldisorders.

In the anxietydisorders, some form of anxiety is either the most predominant disturbancein the clinical picture--as with panic disorder and generalized anxietydisorder--or anxiety is experienced if the individual tries to resist givingin to his symptoms--avoidance of a dreaded object or situation in a phobicdisorder, and obsessions or compulsions in an obsessive-compulsivedisorder. The chief features of panic disorders are recurrent anxiety attacks (atleast three within a three week period) and nervousness. The panic attacksoccur at times other than during marked physical exertion or a life- threateningsituation. During such an attack, the patient may feel as ifhe isout of control or about to die, or he may have premonitions of impending disaster. Generally there are many physiological correlates such as rapid heartrate, irregular breathing, excessive sweating, choking, dizziness, or trembling. Chronic (at least six months), generalized and persistent anxiety characterizesa generalized anxiety disorder. The anxiety in this disorder isnot manifested in the specific symptoms that characterize the other anxietydisorders. In order for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder tobe made, evidence of anxiety should be present in at least three of the followingfour categories: (1) motor tension-the individual may be jittery, restless, and easily startled; (2) autonomic hyperactivity--the patient may reportsymptoms such as excessive sweating, heart pounding, dizziness, hotand cold flashes, or trembling; (3) apprehensive expectation--the individualcontinually worries and anticipates something terrible happening eitherto himself or to his loved ones; (4) vigilance and scanning--the patient, because he is on edge, may complain of difficulty in concentrating, irritability, or even be insomniac. Phobic disorders are characterized by strong, irrational fears of specificobjects or situations. For example, when a person is extremely fearfulof heights, closed spaces, snakes or spiders, provided there is no objectivedanger, the label phobia is likely to be applied to his avoidance andfear. A person suffering from a phobic neurosis knows what he is afraidof and almost always recognizes that his fear is irrational, but he cannotaccount for his fear or control it. Two common phobias, both of whichare discussed in some detail in DSM-III, are agoraphobia--fear of leavinghome, and social phobia--fear of social situations . Although they are separate symptoms, obsessive and compulsive reactionsoften occur together as an anxiety disorder. Obsessions are persistent, often unreasonable thoughts that cannot be banished. A personmay become obsessed with the idea that he will swear, make obscenegestures, or even commit murder. A compulsion is a persistent actwhich is repeated over and over. Virtually any behavior can be viewed asa compulsion if the individual reports an irresistible urge to perform it andexperiences considerable distress if prevented from doing so. The category of atypical anxiety disorder is used when the individualappears to have an anxiety disorder that does not fulfill the criteriafor any of the conditions specified above.

Most psychologists today agree with this definition, although manyexpand upon it. Some psychologists further describe it as the study ofexperience that which occurs inside an individual which may or may not bereported by him. Other psychologists object to such an inclusion.

This definitionwas changed when it was agreed that the mind is not entirely opento scientific analysis. The workings of the mind can only be known throughthe observation of the behavior it controls. Recent efforts to make thediscipline more objective and scientific have resulted in the definition ofpsychology as the study of behavior. The next step in understanding psychologyis to define behavior. Behavior refers to any observable action or reaction of a living organism. Psychology is the study of several levels of behavior, each of whichis of special interest to various types of psychologists. For example, somepsychologists focus on the behavior or actions of nerve cells, sweat glands, and adrenal glands. Other psychologists concentrate on behaviorsthat exist on a higher level such as aggression, prejudice, or problemsolving. Thus the field of psychology is complicated by its several subspecialties, each of which has its own set of approaches. A key word in the definition of behavior is \"observable.\" Behavior refersto movement, activity, or action that is overt. Some behaviors are moreeasily observed than others. An EEG machine is needed to observe brainwave movement, whereas aggressive behavior can be witnessed withthe naked eye. To explain and understand behavior accurately, one must go beyondthe mere reporting of observable movement. Four fundamental characteristicsmust be taken into account. These are: the organism, motivation, knowledge and competence. Differences in behavior are explained in terms of differences in one of thesefactors. The first factor, the organism, refers to the living biological entity--a human being or lower animal--and its biological characteristics andlimits. Behavior cannot be studied properly without accounting for the organism'sbiological capacity. Its nervous system, endocrine system and otherbiological structures must be examined. Knowledge of its biological historyand heredity are also necessary. Motivation must also be accounted for in the study of behavior. Motivation is the immediate cause of behavior. Psychologists define it as theimmediate forces that act to energize, direct, sustain, and stop a behavior. To understand behavior, we must examine its motivational underpinnings. In psychology, the word \"cognition\" is often used in place of \"knowledge\"--that is, what the organism knows. To examine a particular behaviorin its proper perspective, one needs to understand the organism'sperception of his environment and what he knows, thinks, and remembers. Competence is the fourth factor necessary in the understanding of behavior. Competence refers to the skills and abilities of an organism-- howwell he can perform a certain task. Psychology is not as simple as it first appeared. The science of behavioris very complex.

The increased involvement and participation of employees inthe management process has been attempted through such programs asjob simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign. Probably the most popular program designed to involve employees more activelyin management is the goal-setting process called management-by-objectives. First explored and explained by PeterDruckerinThePracticeof Management, this program attaches a great deal of importance to mutual goal-settingbetween employees and supervisors or between different levelsof management. It is assumed that when employees have the opportunityto contribute to the organizational goal-setting, they will be morelikely to understand and accept the objectives as they relate to their ownparticular work and will be more likely to accept them as valid and will, therefore, be more motivated to work for them. The mutual goal-setting process is likely the most important aspect ofthe practical application of the management-by-objectives approach. Either the superior andthe subordinate work together to develop a list of objectivesfor the subordinate or they work individually on the list of objectivesand later compare their work. Important to the success of this procedureis that the manager not disregard the input of the employee and stillprovide leadership and direction in the final formulation of goals. The managermust be willing to take the time necessary to think through his expectationsregarding the subordinate and' must be willing to modify thesegoals somewhat after interaction with the subordinate. This is just the first step in the implementation of this approach. Once agreed upon goals have been constructed, a specific plan for their completionmust be discussed. This plan sketches out in detail how the subordinatewill proceed and usually includes a timetable for completion of specificgoals. One other condition that must be present in an effective management-by-objective(MBO) program is a clear definition of the rewardsthe subordinate will receive as a result of completing the stated goals, These usually take the form of pay raises, promotions, additional authorityor increased staff help, job title, office space or vacation time. The specific rewards must be in keeping with the needs and desires of the individualemployee. This aspect of the approach assumes thattotruly motivatea subordinate toward the achievement of certain goals, the subordinatemust see how the reward system within the organization will tie in with these goals. Finally, after the implementation of the above steps, a management-by-objectiveprogram calls for a review process at which timeboth the manager and subordinate can discuss progress or problems. Reasons for lack of progress can be discussed at this time and specific stepsfor improved future performance discussed. Every effort should be madeto end the session on a positive note so that the subordinate does notfeel a sense of failure or lack of achievement. If carefully carried out, this process by defining the relationship betweenperformance and rewards enables both manager and subordinateto deal more effectively with the eventual merit and performanceappraisal review related to promotions and pay raises.

Either the superior andthe subordinate work together to develop a list of objectivesfor the subordinate or they work individually on the list of objectivesand later compare their work. Important to the success of this procedureis that the manager not disregard the input of the employee and stillprovide leadership and direction in the final formulation of goals. The managermust be willing to take the time necessary to think through his expectationsregarding the subordinate and' must be willing to modify thesegoals somewhat after interaction with the subordinate. This is just the first step in the implementation of this approach. Once agreed upon goals have been constructed, a specific plan for their completionmust be discussed. This plan sketches out in detail how the subordinatewill proceed and usually includes a timetable for completion of specificgoals. One other condition that must be present in an effective management-by-objective(MBO) program is a clear definition of the rewardsthe subordinate will receive as a result of completing the stated goals, These usually take the form of pay raises, promotions, additional authorityor increased staff help, job title, office space or vacation time. The specific rewards must be in keeping with the needs and desires of the individualemployee. This aspect of the approach assumes thattotruly motivatea subordinate toward the achievement of certain goals, the subordinatemust see how the reward system within the organization will tie in with these goals. Finally, after the implementation of the above steps, a management-by-objectiveprogram calls for a review process at which timeboth the manager and subordinate can discuss progress or problems. Reasons for lack of progress can be discussed at this time and specific stepsfor improved future performance discussed. Every effort should be madeto end the session on a positive note so that the subordinate does notfeel a sense of failure or lack of achievement. If carefully carried out, this process by defining the relationship betweenperformance and rewards enables both manager and subordinateto deal more effectively with the eventual merit and performanceappraisal review related to promotions and pay raises. This contributesgreatly to the aims of both the organization and the individual employee."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat implications does the theorizing of B.F.

It was the duty of every individual to redeem himself from the evil into which he was born. Overcoming temptation and resisting evil tendencies were the most important lifelong goals. At this time, a newborn infant was considered a miniature adult. Hence, it was believed that development was merely quantitative. A child at birth was thought to be qualitatively like an adult.

When children did not do this, the adults concluded that their innate evil tendencies were at work. Parents often punished (sometimes cruelly) their children in order to purge them of their wickedness. In the last half of the eighteenth century, J. J. Rousseau promulgated a theory which opposed the medieval view. He believed that children are innately good and that they are naturally endowed with a blueprint for development ; hence they are not preformed at birth.

One hundred years later, Granville Stanley Hall expressed the view that individual development parallels the evolution of the species. This was part of the doctrine of recapitulation. The first major figure to stress the importance of environment in influencing human development was John Locke in the seventeenth century.

One is that social skills become increasingly important to the youth as he begins to make more frequent contact with members of the opposite sex. The child progresses from middle childhood, where he sought companionship with members of his own sex, to a more mature stage where he learns the social etiquette necessary to behave appropriately in the adult world. A second observation that can be made from adolescent social development is that the teenager's parents begin to play less critical roles in his social circle. The child's peers become increasingly important to him. Lefrancois(1973) derived three general stages of social development which reflect the child's shift of reliance for psychological and emotional support from the parents to friends. During the first stage, the young adolescent is quite dependent upon his parents. They continue to be his chief source of physical, emotional and psychological support. A 12-year-old is likely to seek consolation from his parents if he is upset about something. Hence, the parents' word still holds considerable weight although the extent of dependency is not as great as it was when the child was younger. The second stage of social development is marked by conflict. After the onset of puberty, the child's peers begin to exert a great amount of influence over him. He is torn between responsibilities to his parents and his desire to be accepted by peers. This conflict usually results in the child's forming an allegiance with his peers. The adolescent wants to spend much more time with his friends and much less time with his parents. During this intermediate stage, conflict arises from a number of factors including parental interference in social life and school work. The parents may criticize the child's friends and tell him whom to associate with. They may also reprimand him about his grades in school. Adding to these conflicts is the fact that the child is financially dependent on the parents and therefore, must succumb to their wishes most of the time. During this period, the adolescent gradually alienates himself from his parents. This alienation continues to grow until the last stage of adolescent socialization. The third stage of social development is characterized by a relative independence from the parents. This independence does not mean that the adolescent severs all ties with his parents; it simply means that he is now operating in the social realm of his peers whose acceptance continues to be of utmost importance.

These results have, however, come under question as it was found that women who are intellectually and professionally successful show as much n Ach as do men.

Content validity, criterion validity, construct validity, face validity\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe four types of reliability most commonly referred to are: test-retest, split-half, alternate or parallel form, and scorer reliabilities. Test-retest reliability is measured by administering the same test to thesame individual on a second occasion and determining the extent to whichthe score fluctuates. (The reliability is measured by the reliability coefficientwhich is the correlation between the two scores.) This seems likea reasonable method, but there are many problems with it. First of all, ifthe interval between the tests is too long then the behavior being sampledwould be expected to change due to any number of factors includingeducation and maturation or development. If the interval betweentests is too short then there will be practice effects (i.e., the subjectmay have an improved score since he had the practice of taking thefirst test) or the subject might remember some of his answers from the firsttest (whether they were right or wrong) and thus the results would not beindependent. The reliabilitycoefficient,then will be spuriously high. Moreover, there may be variations in the test conditions that cannot be controlled(weather, sudden noises) which may account for most of the variance. Alternate or parallel form reliability avoids many of the problems encounteredin test-retest reliability. The problem of practice effects is reduced(as is the problem of the subject remembering his answers from thefirst test). In alternate-form reliability a subject is tested with one form ofthe test on the first occasion and with a comparable, but different form onthe second occasion. The reliability coefficient is represented by the correlationbetween the score on the first form and the score on the secondform. The use of alternate-form reliability allows the examiner to obtaina measure for two different types of reliability. He will obtain not onlythe measure of the consistency in an individual's score over time, but alsoa measure of consistency in response to different item samples. That is, the examiner has a way of determining if the two forms are actually equivalent; if they are, scores on the second form should not deviate too muchfrom the scores on the first form. Alternate-form reliability also has theadvantage of reducing error variance due to content sampling. Error variance due to content sampling refers to the problem of the subject beingparticularly familiar or unfamiliar with a particular test's content. It is oftenimportant to know to what extent scores on a test depend on factors specificto the particular selection of items. Thus, on a vocabulary test, the subjectmay, by chance happen to know most of the words and his score maynot be indicative of the true extent of his vocabulary. In alternate-form reliability, the examiner obtains two samples of the subject's behavior and canthus be more certain that there is less error variance due to content sampling. Alternate forms of tests should be constructed independently and shouldcontain the same number of items as the first form. Obviously, the rangeand level of difficulty of the items should be equal. Instructions, time limits, and other testing conditions should also be the same. The period of timebetween the administration of the two forms must also be specified. If thetwo tests are administered successively then the advantage of obtainingconsistency of scores over time is lost. When the two forms are administeredsuccessively there is also the problem of fatigue. The subject maybecome tired by the time he takes the second form and thus may not doas well. The reliability may therefore be spuriously low. The problem of practiceeffects was only reduced, not eliminated. Certain problems may involvegeneral principles which if learned once will result in the subject beingable to apply them more easily on a second form. In general, however, alternate-form reliability is a desirable quality. Split-half reliability involves the examiner obtaining two scores for thesubject with one administration of a test. The correlation between thesetwo scores is the reliability coefficient. Usually, the examiner uses thescores on the odd and even items as the two scores. This procedure is preferredto comparing the scores on the first and second halves of the testbecause it reduces the problems of fatigue, boredom, and practice, effectswhich might occur during the second half of the test. Thus, the scoreon the second half might be either spuriously high or spuriously low. Moreover, tests are often constructed such that the items increase with difficultyfrom beginning to end. (The reasoning is that this prevents a subjectfrom \"getting stuck\" on an early item and being unable to reach thoseitems that he could answer successfully.) Thus, if the scores from thefirst and second halves were compared, the scores on the second half mightbe spuriously low due to the greater difficulty of the second half of thetest. Clearly then, splitting the test according to odd-even items is preferable. The split-half reliability coefficient is often called the coefficient ofinternal consistency because the comparison of the two halves of the testindicates whether the items on the test have an underlying consistency. Scorer reliability is used when the scoring on the test is subjective, asin projective testing or tests of creativity. In this case it is essential to knowwhether the scoring technique is sufficiently well-defined so that two scorerscan arrive at the same conclusions.", "ref_id": 1897, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "Name and describe four types of reliability.", "options": ["Test-retest, internal consistency, content validity, concurrent validity", "The four types of reliability are test-retest, split-half, alternate or parallel form, and scorer reliabilities.", "Test-retest, split-half, inter-rater, test validity", "Content validity, criterion validity, construct validity, face validity"], "answer": "B", "solution": "The four types of reliability most commonly referred to are: test-retest, split-half, alternate or parallel form, and scorer reliabilities.

This procedure is preferredto comparing the scores on the first and second halves of the testbecause it reduces the problems of fatigue, boredom, and practice, effectswhich might occur during the second half of the test. Thus, the scoreon the second half might be either spuriously high or spuriously low. Moreover, tests are often constructed such that the items increase with difficultyfrom beginning to end. (The reasoning is that this prevents a subjectfrom \"getting stuck\" on an early item and being unable to reach thoseitems that he could answer successfully.) Thus, if the scores from thefirst and second halves were compared, the scores on the second half mightbe spuriously low due to the greater difficulty of the second half of thetest. Clearly then, splitting the test according to odd-even items is preferable. The split-half reliability coefficient is often called the coefficient ofinternal consistency because the comparison of the two halves of the testindicates whether the items on the test have an underlying consistency. Scorer reliability is used when the scoring on the test is subjective, asin projective testing or tests of creativity. In this case it is essential to knowwhether the scoring technique is sufficiently well-defined so that two scorerscan arrive at the same conclusions."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDiscuss and distinguish between discrete and continuous values.\n\nOptions:\nA.

As a measure of variation it measures the deviationsof scores about the mean. For example, let a distribution be givenby 1, 3, 7, 9, 10. The mean is [(1 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 10) / 5] = (30 / 5) = 6. One measure of deviation would be to subtract each observation from the meanand add the resulting numbers. This gives (1 - 6) + (3 - 6) + (7 - 6) + (9 - 6) + (10 - 6) = - 5 - 3 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 0.

It is thought that most suicides are the acting outof an intolerance for existence rather than a longing for death.

Baumrind's study found that a child's personality is related to the type of discipline he receives from his parents.\nD. The family is the least important socializing agent.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe family is the first important and most powerful socializing agent with whom the child comes into contact. The child receives from the family those things that are necessary for survival; the family fulfills his physiological and psychological needs. The child learns culture from his family: the rules which govern acceptable and unacceptable modes of behavior in his society. He is introduced to the religion of the family (if any), and adopts the values, beliefs and customs of his parents and siblings. (A distinction should be made here between a nuclear family and an extended family. A nuclear family consists of the parents and children alone. An extended family includes the other relatives. In the United States, the nuclear family is the most characteristic family structure. In this discussion, \"family\" refers to the nuclear family.) Baumrind(1967) was interested in the effects of the parent-child relationship on the development of the child's personality.

Overemphasis on individual experiences\nB. Freud's lack of empirical evidence\nC.             Lack of consideration for cultural contexts\nD. Views on sex, the unconscious, and early childhood experience; methods of patient treatment; lengthy and costly process of psychoanalysis\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nFreud's theories have been repeatedly attacked both by those outside the psychoanalytic circle and those psychoanalysts who differ from him on certain theoretical and practical points. Despite the large number of criticisms, classical psychoanalysis remains the favored approach of most psychiatrists and psychoanalysts--even those that doubt the validity of parts of Freud's theory still use his methods of patient treatment. The concepts that have been under fire most often have been his views on sex, the unconscious, and the critical determining character of early childhood experience. Because he was living and working in an age in which the mores were unusually strict concerning the expression of natural sexuality, his strong emphasis on sex has been seen by many to be a reaction to this repressive environment. Today, sex is seen as only one of many basic human needs. His assignment of sexual significance to early childhood experience has also suffered severe attack. Cross-cultural studies have failed to confirm the universality of the Oedipus Complex. Also, studies designed to test other hypotheses regarding early parent- child relations have proved inconclusive . The psychoanalytic method has been criticized because the techniques of free association, dream analysis and transference demand that the patient be relatively healthy to start with, highly motivated to improve and quite skilled at expressing and interpreting his thoughts and feelings. It has also been demonstrated that the lengthy, costly process of psychoanalysis is no more effective than shorter, less costly procedures that are more widely applicable.

Despite the large number of criticisms, classical psychoanalysis remains the favored approach of most psychiatrists and psychoanalysts--even those that doubt the validity of parts of Freud's theory still use his methods of patient treatment. The concepts that have been under fire most often have been his views on sex, the unconscious, and the critical determining character of early childhood experience. Because he was living and working in an age in which the mores were unusually strict concerning the expression of natural sexuality, his strong emphasis on sex has been seen by many to be a reaction to this repressive environment. Today, sex is seen as only one of many basic human needs. His assignment of sexual significance to early childhood experience has also suffered severe attack. Cross-cultural studies have failed to confirm the universality of the Oedipus Complex. Also, studies designed to test other hypotheses regarding early parent- child relations have proved inconclusive . The psychoanalytic method has been criticized because the techniques of free association, dream analysis and transference demand that the patient be relatively healthy to start with, highly motivated to improve and quite skilled at expressing and interpreting his thoughts and feelings. It has also been demonstrated that the lengthy, costly process of psychoanalysis is no more effective than shorter, less costly procedures that are more widely applicable.

For learning to occur the organism must be in a relatively high state of arousal. No important or significant learning can take place during sleep. An organism must not only be aroused it must also be motivated. Motivation is important because it allows behavior to be elicited. It is assumed that children learn in a school environment because it motivates them in some way. Some psychologists contend that children learn in school because of an innate need to achieve mastery. Others claim that children learn because they are motivated by the approval or love they receive for success. Thus, motivation and reinforcement are closely linked and are perhaps inseparable. Reinforcements come in two forms, positive and negative (or reward and punishment). Despite what some educators or parents might feel, positive reinforcement or reward has been shown to be significantly more effective in changing behavior than negative reinforcement or punishment. Some psychologists strongly believe that all learning is reinforced. Sometimes the reinforcements are not obvious; they are nevertheless present. It is important to note that the principle of reinforcement is practically universal in psychology, even among psychoanalysts.

The term association implies a connection in time and place between two events. The formation of associations is the function of the brain.

The startle response takes its name from the reaction of the subject. A startle response is usually experimentally elicited by a loud and sudden noise presented to an unsuspecting subject. The entire response occurs very quickly and has the most consistent pattern of any emotional response pattern. The response begins with a rapid closing of the eyes followed by a widening of the mouth. The head and the neck then thrust forward while the muscles of the neck stand out with the chin tilting up. Many investigators believe this to be an inborn response, thus requiring little learning or experience. Facial and vocal expressions are much less consistent than the startle response. There is wide variety in the facial and vocal reactions of different individuals to the same stimulus. However, there are three different dimensions of emotional expression which can be observed. These are pleasantness--unpleasantness, attention--rejection, and sleep--tension. In pleasant emotions, in general, the eyes and mouth slant upward; in unpleasantness both slant downward. On the second dimension, attention is characterized by wide-open eyes, and often by flared nostrils and open mouth, while in rejection, eyes, nostrils, and mouth are all tightly shut. In sleep, for the most part, there is no facial expression and the eyes are closed. At the other extreme, tension, there is a great deal of emotional expression in the face. The voice is also an important instrument for indicating emotion. In general, laughter indicates enjoyment; sobbing indicates sorrow; screaming can express fear or surprise; and groans denote pain or unhappiness. A low voice or a break or tremor may indicate deep sorrow. Anger is usually expressed by a sharp, loud, high-pitched voice. Posture and gestures are the third important means of emotional expression.

In happiness or pleasantness, the head is usually held high and the chest out; in sorrow, posture is often slumped with the face tilting downward; in anger, aggressive gestures are often made such as fist clenching; and in fear, the individual either flees or remains frozen in one spot."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDescribe the two major physiological theories of depression.\n\nOptions:\nA.

Both theories implicate biochemical factors. The first theory is concerned primarily with electrolyte metabolism and the second with the chemicals involved in neural transmission. Electrolytes dissolve and dissociate into electrically charged moving particles which carry electric current. Two of the most important electrolytes are sodium and potassium chlorides. The positively charged sodium and potassium particles are distributed differently on either side of the membrane of a nerve cell. There is a higher concentration of sodium outside the neuron and a higher concentration of potassium within it. This difference helps maintain what is referred to as the \"resting potential\" of the cell. Alterations in the distribution of sodium and potassium produce changes in the resting potential, which in turn affect the excitability of the neuron, that is, whether it is readily excited and thus fired by impulses transmitted from another neuron. Research has found that in depressed patients there is an elevated concentration of sodium within the neuron. The effect of such a relatively high concentration is to lower the resting potential of the neuron, making it more excitable. Data in addition to those on intracellular sodium levels (e.g. studies which show a higher than normal arousal pattern in the EEGs of depressives) indicate that the depressive' s nervous system is hyperexcitable, even though his behavior patterns might make us expect it to be less excitable than that of the normal individual. Not enough is known about the specific relationships between the nervous system and behavior to explain how the apparenthyperexcitabilityof the depressive's nervous system causes the symptoms of depression. However, the data indicating that the depressive has a greater than normal intracellular level of sodium, and thus a more excitable nervous system, suggests that electrolytes may play a causal role in depression. The other physiological theory of depression is in almost opposition to the preceding one. This theory suggests that depression results from retardation of the transmission of impulses from one neural fiber to another. It should be noted that whereas the theory discussed previously applies to the entire nervous system, this theory applies only to the sympathetic nervous system and its neurotransmitternorepinephrine. Several pieces of evidence support this theory indirectly. Experiments performed with dogs have shown that \"depressed\" dogs have low levels of norepinephrine.

The three predominant models of abnormal behavior are the statistical model, the medical model, and the learning model. The Statistical Model is concerned with distribution of specific behavioral and mental characteristics in the population. Almost by definition, a low frequency of occurrence of a certain characteristic within the general population results in this characteristic being seen as \"abnormal.\" Thus, the statistical model can provide at most a partial description of what we mean by \"abnormal.\" A more useful model is the Medical Model. The critical assumption here is that abnormal behavior can be likened to a disease. Both somatogenic (originating in the body) and psychogenic (originating in the mind) causes, are considered in this model. Both can occur internally (systemic or infectious) or externally (traumatic). Psychoanalytic theory can be considered an example of a psychogenic diseasemodel. There are both systemic and traumatic disease components in Freudian theory. Systemic causes are exemplified by an innately weak \"instinct,\" while traumatic components would include the varied and individually specific effects of external experiences on people. The third major model in use is a Learning Model, which is closely related to \"behaviorism.\" Here, the crucial assumption is that abnormal behavior is learned behavior and that is learned in the same way as is most other human behavior. In this model the importance of biological and genetic factors is minimized, so that the learning model is primarily psychogenic in nature. B. F. Skinner, an extreme behaviorist, does not refer to internal states (mental processes) at all in his writings, but other learning model theorists do use a \"mediational approach\" and do consider intervening mental and emotional processes. The viewpoint of these latter theorists is somewhat closer to a disease model of mental illness than Skinner, who rejects the medical models outright. As yet, there are no overwhelming and conclusive data in support of any one model. Indeed, it is unlikely that any one of the above models will ever be able to fully account for all abnormal behaviors as the behaviors being dealt with, the varied experiences of people, and the people themselves, are so very complex.

Adorno then tried to identify people's personality characteristics by first looking at their ideology. To do this, he developed what is now called the California F (fascist) Scale for measuring the \"authoritarian personality.\" He began with the idea that fascist ideology is comprised of three things: anti-Semitism, ethnocentrism (tendency to reject other ethnic groups than one's own), and political and economic conservatism. Initially, he gave separate scales for these items to large numbers of Americans. He predicted that scores on these scales would correlate, which they did. Conservatism, however, had a much lower correlation than ethnocentrism and anti-Semitism. Next, Adorno collected biographical information from the people who scored high on the scales and gave them additional tests until he developed a personality profile for the trait of \"authoritarianism.\" As it is used today, scores on the F (fascist) Scale correlate highly with anti-Semitism and ethnocentrism and correlate moderately with political-economic conservatism. The F Scale also predicts ethnic prejudice. The F Scale is an attitude-trait scale. Attitude-trait scales usually have to do with others in the person's social world. The responses are taken to be indicative of a characteristic mode of reacting to others. Examples of questions from the F Scale are: Obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn.

Discuss.\n\nOptions:\nA. Only biological factors\nB. Only social factors\nC.             Genetic factors\nD. Biological and social factors\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThis classic phrase \"anatomy is destiny\" reflects the basic premise in Freud's theory that biological, anatomical differences in the sexes are responsible for their personality differences. A central concept in the different early experiences of boys and girls that contributes greatly to adult personality structure, according to Freud, is that girls experience \"penis envy\" upon discovering that they are differently constructed than boys which leads to, among other things, feelings of inferiority, jealousy, weak moral sense and desire to have a baby to substitute for the lack of a penis. Followers of Freud have developed and refined this basic idea. Eric Erikson set forth a less psychoanalytic theory, but one that was still based on anatomy. He felt that due to their different biological roles men were more motivated to achieve, while women had a greater need to be accepted by other people. This position that biological differences explain the differences in personality of men and women has also traditionally been supported by examples from the animal kingdom. Since anatomical and behavioral differences exist in almost all other species, they must also exist in humans. There are obviously differences anatomically in men and women, but how much do they account for the psychological differences we assign to the two sexes? Let us look at the facts surrounding this question. Men are generally larger and more muscular than women at birth; they are also more aggressive; women are more verbal earlier than men; men do have better visual, spatial and mathematical abilities. However, no evidence has been found by the most recent researchers in this area (Maccoby, et al.) that girls are more sociable, more suggestible, less achievement-oriented, or less self-caring than boys. Similarly, there seems to be no differences between men and women in simple memory, intellectual, or analytic abilities. There appears to be much evidence, in fact, that while in lower animals a great deal of behavior is attributable to hormones, the influence of biology decreases as one goes up the phylogenetic scale. Experiences after birth seem to be much more important in determining a person's sex- role typing behavior. Studies with hermaphrodites--people born with both ovaries and testes--have proven most interesting in this regard. Money, et. al. studied 105 biological hermaphrodites whose parents decided which sex the child would be assigned at birth and raised him or her as either a boy or a girl. If anatomy were destiny we would expect that a large number of these people would have demonstrated behavior different than that which their parents assigned them. This, however, was not the case. Only 5 of the 105 individuals studied deviated from the sex assigned them by their parents. The decision as to whether these children would be raised as a boy or a girl, then, appears to be much more important than the biological sex in determining behavior. Margaret Mead's anthropological studies of different tribes in the South Pacific also puts the biology-as-determinant question in a weak position. She discovered tribes in which women were the dominant force, the leaders, and men were docile, dependent and seductive. If nothing else, her research has helped to prove that sex-linked behavior is not universal and therefore does not appear to be genetically-linked. Rather, stereotyped sex-role behavior seems to result much more from the socialization practices of a society.", "ref_id": 1938, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "\"Anatomy is destiny,\" claimed Sigmund Freud when he characterized personality differences in men and women.

Observational learning, Direct instruction, and Punishment\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nOften, especially in childhood, learning occurs by imitation without obvious reinforcement or an intention to teach. Hence, children often take on the behavior and the attitudes of their parents. There has been relatively little research on how people acquire attitudes through imitation or modeling (observation of a model of behavior), but it seems reasonable that children acquire many of their attitudes through this process. A father who is often referring to household chores and cooking as \"women's work\" is likely to produce children who see those activities as more appropriate for women than men. Although the family has the strongest early impact on the formation of attitudes through observation, later on, one's peer or reference group becomes of equal, if not more, importance. Theodore Newcomb's now classic study of Bennington College student's attitudes form their first year through their graduation demonstrated the strong effect a reference group can have on attitudes. Most of the students in their first year held conservative political attitudes, much as their parents did. By the time these same students graduated, they had acquired significantly more liberal attitudes--like those of their classmates. Attitudes are also sometimes acquired by the process of classical conditioning. If you repeatedly give a person a neutral word and immediately follow it with a word that evokes a strong negative or positive reaction from the person, this will eventually cause the same type of reaction to the previously neutral word. Thus, a person's attitude toward an object or a situation can in part be determined by the connotative meaning the person has attached to it. The connotative meaning is the emotional coloring which is often acquired by some process of nonlaboratory classical conditioning. For example, political candidates with the last name \"Kennedy\" in the years after the Kennedy administration were thought to have a marked advantage simply because of the positive connotations publicly associated with the name \"Kennedy.\" The learning of attitudes can also take place through operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, a subject emits a behavior in the apparent absence of any stimulus. If the behavior is reinforced positively, the likelihood that it will be repeated is increased; if it is punished, the chances of it occurring again are lessened. If, after watching a television cartoon in which there were both Caucasian and black children represented, your five-year-old exclaims, \"I want a black friend like Johnny,\" you respond with a smile and a warm assurance that maybe one day he will have such a friend, you have rewarded him with your smile and reinforced his positive attitude toward darker-skinned children. If, on the other hand, you scowl and admonish him for even considering such a thing, telling him that he should \"stick to his own kind,\" you have punished his response, and if others in his environment make similar comments about appropriate playmates, chances are that he will develop negative attitudes about children that are at all different from him in appearance. Though it may seem that the principles of attitude acquisition are simple, the actual process is quite complex. An adult's attitudes are quite difficult to trace to their source. This is complicated still more by the fact that attitudes can change, even quite significantly in the course of a person's lifetime.

Five categories of dissociative disorders are listed in DSM-III: (1) psychogenic amnesia, (2) psychogenic fugue, (3) multiple personality, (4) depersonalization disorder, and (5) other dissociative disorders Psychogenic amnesia involves loss of memory for a period of time, during which the amnesiac cannot remember his name or anything abouthis previous life, but retains his knowledge of how to function in the world. Amnesia begins suddenly, usually following severe psychosocial stress. The stress often involves the possibility of physical injury or death. In other instances, the stress is due to the unacceptability of certain acts orimpulses, such as engaging in a homosexual affair. In still other instances, the individual is in a subjectively intolerable life situation, such asabandonment by a spouse. The essential features of psychogenic fugue are the sudden onset oftravel away from one's customary surroundings and an inability to recall one'sprior identity. Frequently a person with this disorder will move to a newgeographic location and start an entirely new life. This new identity willusually be more gregarious and uninhibited than his prior personality (whichis typically quiet and very ordinary) . Like amnesia, a fugue is usuallyprecipitated by psychosocial stress. Marital quarrels, personal rejections, and conditions of military conflict or natural disaster are commonexamples.

Multiple personality, the presence of separate and different personalitieswithin the same individual, is perhaps the most dramatic type ofdissociative reaction.

Depression is a lack of gratification\nD. Depression is a result of childhood trauma\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nFreud's theory of depression stems from his views on development and on the unconscious processes involved in mourning. In order to understand his theory of depression, we must first describe these views. Freud saw the potential for depression being created early in childhood, specifically during the oral period. During this stage, which lasts through the first year of life, the anatomical location of the sexual instinct is the mouth. The child is presumed to enjoy stimulation of the mouth region through touch and taste and use of muscle. If the child receives too little or too much \"oral gratification\" in this stage, he may develop an \"oral fixation,\" which may result, according to Freud, in his being overly dependent on other people for the maintenance of hisselfesteem. Freud's view of mourning also plays a role in his theory of depression. Freud hypothesized that after the loss of a loved one the mourner \"introjects\" the lost person into himself; that is, he identifies with the lost one. Because, as Freud asserted, we often unconsciously harbor negative feelings against those we love, afterintrojectionthe mourner becomes the object of his own hate and anger. In addition, the mourner may also resent being deserted by the lost one and may feel guilt concerning real or imagined sins against the lost person. The period of introjectionis normally followed by the period of mourning work, during which the mourner recalls memories of the lost one and thereby separates himself from the deceased individual. The normal process of mourning work may go astray in overly dependent individuals (individuals fixated at the oral stage) and develop into an ongoing process ofselfblameand depression. Such an individual does not loosen his emotional bonds with the deceased loved one and instead continues to castigate himself for the perceived faults in the (still introjected) loved one. Thus, the mourner's anger toward the lost one continues to be directed inward upon himself. Using the above analysis Freud maintained that depression is anger turned against oneself. However, it appears that many people become depressed and remain so without having recently lost a loved one. In order to maintain the viability of his theory in the face of evidence suggesting that this was indeed so, Freud invoked the concept of \"symbolic loss.\" For example, a person may unconsciously interpret a rejection as a total withdrawal of love. A symbolic loss must be worked through in the same way as a real loss. In each case, the unconscious processes ofintrojectionand mourning work are brought into play. In overly dependent individuals, these processes can go astray and result in depression, whether the loss be real or symbolic. There are several problems in Freud's theory. First, since the person presumably hates and loves the individual he has lost, why is it that only the hate and anger are turned inward and not the love ? If the mourner directed his positive feelings concerning the lost one inward, he would be a happy rather than a depressed person. Freud fails to explain why only negative feelings towards the lost one areintrojected. A second difficulty lies in Freud's hypothesis that the seeds of depression are sown in an oral fixation. Freud states that fixation at the oral stage is caused by either too much or too little gratification; however, he gives no indication of how much gratification is enough to prevent fixation. Freud's theory, beingnonquantitative, does not adequately deal with the question of what amount of gratification is involved in fixation.

The criticisms include that the diagnostic classes are not homogeneous, the system is not reliable, and the system lacks validity.\nD. The classification system is too complex\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe American Psychiatric Association (APA) has developed a classification system of mental illnesses known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The most recent is the DSM III. The classification system has been criticized on the grounds that: (1) the diagnostic classes are not homogeneous, (2) the system is not reliable, and the system lacks validity. Whenever a class is formed, the behavior of all its members should be similar along the dimensions distinguishing the classification. That is, there should be some behavioral homogeneity. For example, one of the defining characteristics of an obsessive-compulsive are the intrusive thoughts which the patient seems unable to control. If we were to examine a group of people who had been classified as obsessive-compulsives, we would expect them to all display the symptom of intrusive thoughts. However, many studies have found that knowing what diagnostic category a patient falls into tells relatively little about the actual behavior of the patient. It is commonly found that certain symptoms appear in a number of diagnostic categories, thus making it difficult to predict reliably what the diagnosis will be given the occurrence of a symptom. The problem is that the current diagnostic system does not adequately specify how many of these various symptoms must be present or the degree to which they must be manifest in order to make a diagnosis. The second criticism refers to the reliability of the classification (diagnostic) system. Whether or not different diagnosticians will agree that a given diagnostic label should be applied to a particular person is the test of reliability. For a classification system to work, those applying it must be able to agree on what is and what is not an instance of a particular class. There are 3 major reasons why diagnosticians do not always agree: (1) inconsistencies on the part of the patient, such as giving certain information to one diagnostician and not to another, (2) inconsistencies on the part of the diagnostician, such as differences in interview techniques and interpretation of the symptoms, and (3) inadequacies of the diagnostic system, such as unclear criteria. Either too fine a distinction was required or the system forced the diagnostician to choose a category that was not specific enough. In diagnosing abnormal behavior, no infallible measurement device exists; the only means of assessing reliability is whether or not diagnosticians agree. The third criticism of the classification system is its lack of validity. Whether or not predictions (or valid statements) can be made about a class once it has been formed is the test of validity. Validity has a very specific relation to reliability: the less reliable a category is, the more difficult it is to make valid statements about the category.

The preoperational stage involves logical thinking and reasoning.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAccording to Piaget, a preschooler's cognitive development is at the preoperationalstage. The preoperational stage consists of twosubstages: Thepreconceptualwhichlasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought whichextends from ages 4 to 7. In contrast to the intelligence of an infant, a preschooler's intelligenceallows him to internalize objects and events in his environment. Whereas an infant understands only what he immediately perceivesand can perform activities only on objects immediately present, thepreschooler employs symbolism. Symbolism includes the use of symbolsand language to represent the world. The child can now think and speakof objects that are not immediately perceived. He develops concepts- actually, \"preconcepts,\" since they are not fully developed. These preconcepts, or the beginnings of cognitive thinking, enable the childto divide objects in the world on the basis of common properties. For example, a preschooler can recognize and name an elephant because of itsmassive size, gray color, floppy ears, and trunk. However, the preschoolercannot distinguish among different objects of the same class oranimals of the same species. For example, a child who sees an elephantin a zoo and later sees another elephant in a circus would probablythink that it was the same animal. The child's reasoning ability during thepreconceptualperiod can be dividedinto two types:transductivereasoning andsyncreticreasoning. Transductive reasoning occurs when the child bases his inferences onone particular occurrence or on a single attribute of an object. For example, a child might conclude that trucks and cars are the same objects sinceboth have wheels. Likewise, if he sees a chicken lay an egg, he mightassume that all animals lay eggs. Syncretic reasoning reflects the child's constantly changing criteria forclassification. This reasoning leads him to classify objects together that aredisparate. For example, to distinguish among trucks, cars, and buses, thechild would group all the trucks together. But he might also group blue carswith the trucks if one of the trucks is blue.

The preoperational stage consists of twosubstages: Thepreconceptualwhichlasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought whichextends from ages 4 to 7. In contrast to the intelligence of an infant, a preschooler's intelligenceallows him to internalize objects and events in his environment. Whereas an infant understands only what he immediately perceivesand can perform activities only on objects immediately present, thepreschooler employs symbolism. Symbolism includes the use of symbolsand language to represent the world. The child can now think and speakof objects that are not immediately perceived. He develops concepts- actually, \"preconcepts,\" since they are not fully developed. These preconcepts, or the beginnings of cognitive thinking, enable the childto divide objects in the world on the basis of common properties. For example, a preschooler can recognize and name an elephant because of itsmassive size, gray color, floppy ears, and trunk. However, the preschoolercannot distinguish among different objects of the same class oranimals of the same species. For example, a child who sees an elephantin a zoo and later sees another elephant in a circus would probablythink that it was the same animal. The child's reasoning ability during thepreconceptualperiod can be dividedinto two types:transductivereasoning andsyncreticreasoning. Transductive reasoning occurs when the child bases his inferences onone particular occurrence or on a single attribute of an object. For example, a child might conclude that trucks and cars are the same objects sinceboth have wheels. Likewise, if he sees a chicken lay an egg, he mightassume that all animals lay eggs. Syncretic reasoning reflects the child's constantly changing criteria forclassification. This reasoning leads him to classify objects together that aredisparate.

Sampling statistics are approximations of the population parameters. For example, the sample mean is said to approximate the population mean. The most important sampling statistics are the sample mean and the samplevariance. To illustrate the meanings of these terms, consider the followingexample. A psychologist selects a sample of 32 rats and records thetime they take to complete a maze. The times are X(Time) f(x) # of rats xf (x) 29 1 29 31 1 31 32 2 64 33 2 66 34 3 102 35 4 140 36 5 180 37 5 185 38 4 152 39 2 78 40 2 80 41 1 41 The sample average (mean) is found by adding up thexf(x) column and dividingby 32. Thus, x (mean) = 35.9. The computation of the sample varianceis more involved but can be found to be 7.6 using the formula s^2 = [{\\sumf_i(x_i -x)^2} / (n - 1)]. Where each value (x_i) is subtracted from the mean(x) and squared, each of these squared values are summed and the totalis divided by the number of values (rats) giving the variance (7.6). In theabsence of prior research the psychologist assumes that the times are normallydistributed. Thus the population consists of all the rats that could conceivablyrun through the maze and the population is described by the averagetime and variance. What can the psychologist say about the parent population on the basisof the sample and calculated sample statistics? He cannot definitely assertthat the population mean and variance are 35.9 and 7.6. Different sampleswould no doubt yield different sample means and sample variances. Thus the best he can do is give an interval within which the populationmean is most likely to fall (and similarly for the population variance) In order to make such a statement he must know something aboutthe population of sample means and the population of sample variances, i.e. their distributions. If the psychologist were to take an infinite number of samples, then, accordingto the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample meanswill approximate a normal distribution with mean \\mu and variance (\\sigma^2 / N) (whereN is sample size). The sampling distribution of the sample varianceis more complicated. It is known as the Chi-Square distribution. We say that the statistic [{(n - 1)s^2} / \\sigma^2] has a X^2 distribution with (n - 1) degreesof freedom. The X^2 values can be found from a table. Since [{\\sum(x_i -x)^2} / (n - 1)] = S^2 is calculated from the sample, this enables us to makeprobability statements concerning \\sigma^2, the population variance. Thus the sample mean of a sample of size n taken from a populationwith mean \\mu and variance a has \\sigma^2 normal distribution with mean\\mu and variance (\\sigma^2 / n). The sample variance (the ratio (n - 1)s^2/ \\sigma^2) fromthe same population has the same population has the X^2 distribution with(n - 1) degrees of freedom.", "ref_id": 1972, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What are the most important sampling statistics?

The times are X(Time) f(x) # of rats xf (x) 29 1 29 31 1 31 32 2 64 33 2 66 34 3 102 35 4 140 36 5 180 37 5 185 38 4 152 39 2 78 40 2 80 41 1 41 The sample average (mean) is found by adding up thexf(x) column and dividingby 32. Thus, x (mean) = 35.9. The computation of the sample varianceis more involved but can be found to be 7.6 using the formula s^2 = [{\\sumf_i(x_i -x)^2} / (n - 1)]. Where each value (x_i) is subtracted from the mean(x) and squared, each of these squared values are summed and the totalis divided by the number of values (rats) giving the variance (7.6). In theabsence of prior research the psychologist assumes that the times are normallydistributed. Thus the population consists of all the rats that could conceivablyrun through the maze and the population is described by the averagetime and variance. What can the psychologist say about the parent population on the basisof the sample and calculated sample statistics? He cannot definitely assertthat the population mean and variance are 35.9 and 7.6. Different sampleswould no doubt yield different sample means and sample variances. Thus the best he can do is give an interval within which the populationmean is most likely to fall (and similarly for the population variance) In order to make such a statement he must know something aboutthe population of sample means and the population of sample variances, i.e. their distributions. If the psychologist were to take an infinite number of samples, then, accordingto the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample meanswill approximate a normal distribution with mean \\mu and variance (\\sigma^2 / N) (whereN is sample size). The sampling distribution of the sample varianceis more complicated. It is known as the Chi-Square distribution. We say that the statistic [{(n - 1)s^2} / \\sigma^2] has a X^2 distribution with (n - 1) degreesof freedom. The X^2 values can be found from a table. Since [{\\sum(x_i -x)^2} / (n - 1)] = S^2 is calculated from the sample, this enables us to makeprobability statements concerning \\sigma^2, the population variance. Thus the sample mean of a sample of size n taken from a populationwith mean \\mu and variance a has \\sigma^2 normal distribution with mean\\mu and variance (\\sigma^2 / n). The sample variance (the ratio (n - 1)s^2/ \\sigma^2) fromthe same population has the same population has the X^2 distribution with(n - 1) degrees of freedom."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA survey asking for the number of times toast is burned duringone week was distributed to eight randomly selected households.

Therefore, in order for subjects to attain a concept, they must: - learn what the attributes are; - code the attributes into the stimulus objects; - learn to group the objects into various concepts using the rules of logic.

Intelligence is solely determined by environmental factors\nB. Intelligence is solely determined by genetic factors\nC.             Intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors\nD. Intelligence is not affected by either genetic or environmental factors\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIt is clear to most psychologists that intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. The predominant view is that the genetic factors place an absolute ceiling on an individual's intelligence potential, and he may or may not reach this potential, depending on how enriched or deprived his environment is. Thus an individual may have the potential to develop an IQ of 120, but if his learning environment was bad in childhood his IQ may never develop past 105. It is believed that there is a critical period in a person's childhood in which he must develop certain intellectual functions. If this critical period is characterized by emotional, intellectual, social, or physical (e.g., food, shelter) deprivation, then the person's IQ will not develop to its full potential. This is usually an irreversible result; that is, even if the person's later life is enriched, he will not be able to raise his IQ significantly and reach his potential. There are many instances in which a young child's IQ increases with an improvement in environment.Skeels(1966) conducted a study in which he took very young, girls (under 19.3 months) from an orphanage in which the environment was seriously depressed and placed them in an institution for the mentally retarded. Their IQ's improved from a mean of 65 for the group to a mean of 91.8 during an 18 month period. The cause of the subnormal mean IQ of 65 was the lack of personal attention in the orphanage. The girls had a severe emotional deficit which impaired their intellectual development. In the institution for the mentally retarded, the girls experienced improved caretaking by retarded adult women who had a mental age of five to nine years. These retarded women were attentive and affectionate towards the little girls and this compensated for the previous emotional deficit. Eleven of the thirteen children placed in the institution for the mentally retarded were adopted. Another group of 12 little girls stayed in the orphanage; their mean IQ dropped from 86.7 to 60.5 in two years. None of these girls was adopted, and one of them died. In another study by Newman et al (1937), it was found that the average correlation of intelligence between identical twins raised in very similar environments was .88; whereas the correlation of intelligence for fraternal twins raised in very similar environments was only .63. This difference between identical and fraternal twins indicates that heredity is an important factor in determining IQ. However, the correlation of intelligence for siblings is only .51-.53; and since any two siblings are as genetically similar as any two fraternal twins the difference in the correlation between the two groups must be attributed to environmental factors. Obviously, fraternal twins are raised in more similar environments than are siblings in general. When the correlation of intelligence for identical twins raised apart from each other was computed it was found that the correlation was .77. The correlation of intelligence for identical twins raised apart was still higher than the correlation of intelligence for fraternal twins and for siblings. This evidence seems to suggest that heredity plays a more important role in determining intelligence than does environment. However, this study was conducted with a small number of subjects and therefore the results are not as impressive or authoritative as they seem. Thus it can be seen that heredity and environment combine to determine an individual's intelligence. It appears that a child's father's occupation is the most accurate predictor of a child's future IQ. Father's occupation is even more effective in prediction than father's IQ. Psychologists are still actively involved in determining heritability indices for intelligence. A heritability index represents what proportion of the variance of a particular trait in a given population (the individual differences--that is, why person A has an IQ of 80 and person B has an IQ of 150) is attributable to hereditary or genetic factors. The higher the heritability index, the more pessimistic is the outlook for raising an individual's IQ.", "ref_id": 1979, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What is the relationship between the genetic factor and the environmental factor in intelligence?", "options": ["Intelligence is solely determined by environmental factors", "Intelligence is solely determined by genetic factors", "Intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors", "Intelligence is not affected by either genetic or environmental factors"], "answer": "C", "solution": "It is clear to most psychologists that intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.

Thus an individual may have the potential to develop an IQ of 120, but if his learning environment was bad in childhood his IQ may never develop past 105. It is believed that there is a critical period in a person's childhood in which he must develop certain intellectual functions. If this critical period is characterized by emotional, intellectual, social, or physical (e.g., food, shelter) deprivation, then the person's IQ will not develop to its full potential. This is usually an irreversible result; that is, even if the person's later life is enriched, he will not be able to raise his IQ significantly and reach his potential. There are many instances in which a young child's IQ increases with an improvement in environment.Skeels(1966) conducted a study in which he took very young, girls (under 19.3 months) from an orphanage in which the environment was seriously depressed and placed them in an institution for the mentally retarded. Their IQ's improved from a mean of 65 for the group to a mean of 91.8 during an 18 month period. The cause of the subnormal mean IQ of 65 was the lack of personal attention in the orphanage. The girls had a severe emotional deficit which impaired their intellectual development. In the institution for the mentally retarded, the girls experienced improved caretaking by retarded adult women who had a mental age of five to nine years. These retarded women were attentive and affectionate towards the little girls and this compensated for the previous emotional deficit. Eleven of the thirteen children placed in the institution for the mentally retarded were adopted. Another group of 12 little girls stayed in the orphanage; their mean IQ dropped from 86.7 to 60.5 in two years. None of these girls was adopted, and one of them died. In another study by Newman et al (1937), it was found that the average correlation of intelligence between identical twins raised in very similar environments was .88; whereas the correlation of intelligence for fraternal twins raised in very similar environments was only .63. This difference between identical and fraternal twins indicates that heredity is an important factor in determining IQ. However, the correlation of intelligence for siblings is only .51-.53; and since any two siblings are as genetically similar as any two fraternal twins the difference in the correlation between the two groups must be attributed to environmental factors. Obviously, fraternal twins are raised in more similar environments than are siblings in general. When the correlation of intelligence for identical twins raised apart from each other was computed it was found that the correlation was .77. The correlation of intelligence for identical twins raised apart was still higher than the correlation of intelligence for fraternal twins and for siblings. This evidence seems to suggest that heredity plays a more important role in determining intelligence than does environment. However, this study was conducted with a small number of subjects and therefore the results are not as impressive or authoritative as they seem. Thus it can be seen that heredity and environment combine to determine an individual's intelligence. It appears that a child's father's occupation is the most accurate predictor of a child's future IQ. Father's occupation is even more effective in prediction than father's IQ. Psychologists are still actively involved in determining heritability indices for intelligence. A heritability index represents what proportion of the variance of a particular trait in a given population (the individual differences--that is, why person A has an IQ of 80 and person B has an IQ of 150) is attributable to hereditary or genetic factors. The higher the heritability index, the more pessimistic is the outlook for raising an individual's IQ."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nDiscuss the influence of heredity on personality.\n\nOptions:\nA.

Serial learning occurs when a list of items is memorized and recalled in a particular order. Someone learning the series of events leading up to the American Civil War must engage in serial learning. In experiments, serial learning is studied with lists of words, numbers or nonsense syllables. The subject is presented with the whole list and each time he attempts to learn the items on it he must recite the list in the correct order. This is sometimes called the study-test method. The subject tries to write down the list in the correct order but does not know whether he is correct or not until the next study trial is presented for him to learn. This method seems to yield better learning results than the serial-anticipation method described below. In serial-anticipation learning, a list of items, usually nonsense syllables, is also used in experimentation. The items are presented one at a time for a standard time interval -- usually two seconds. The first time the list is presented, the subject will not know what successive syllables are correct. But beginning with the second trial, he is asked to anticipate the syllable that follows the one he is looking at. If the list consisted of Jiz, Mux, Xoy and so on, he would first be shown Jiz and be expected to say Mux. Two seconds later Mux would appear, letting the subject know that he was correct and giving him the cue for anticipating Xoy. A student learning a vocabulary list in order also does this to a certain extent. After a word on the list is covered, the student anticipates what the next one is. This method provides immediate feedback to the student about the accuracy of his response. When he is shown the first item, he guesses the second one. Then he is given the second item so that he can guess the third. This tells him if he was correct on the previous guess. This is unlike the study-test method, where the correct responses are not known until the next time the complete list is presented. In paired-associate learning, the subject must learn a list of paired items. The left-hand item of the pair is the stimulus item and the right-hand item is the response item. The subject must learn the pairs so that when given the stimulus item, he can produce the response item. This type of learning occurs in many situations. For example, when someone is attempting to learn a foreign language, there is a stimulus item and a response item. The stimulus item is a word in the foreign language (casa), and the response item is the corresponding word in English (house). When the stimulus term (casa) is seen, the response term (house) is remembered. In experimentation, paired lists of nonsense syllables, words, or numbers are constructed. After the subject learns the list, the response item must be given when the stimulus item is presented. Free recall learning is the learning and recalling of a list of items. The retrieved items need not be in any specific order. Everything, however, must be remembered. Here, the experimenter's emphasis is on how the responses are organized by the subject. The order the subject chooses in recalling the items demonstrates the type of organization that took place.

It was originally known as the \"free association test.\" The procedure is simple; the examinee is presented with a series of disconnected words one at a time and is asked to respond by giving the first word that comes to his mind. Originally, the early experimental psychologists used this test to explore thinking processes in accordance with their doctrines of associationism.Associationismrefers to the belief of some early psychologists that learning involves an association between processes in the brain. These processes in the brain supposedly represent stimulus events experienced by the individual. The word association test was designed to explore these associations. The clinical use of the word association test was stimulated by the psychoanalytic movement. Carl Jung (1910) selected words which represented common \"emotional complexes\" and analyzed the responses with reference to reaction time, content, and physical expressions of emotional tension.Rapaportdeveloped another test (1946) which consisted of a 60-word list. Most of the 60 words on the list were selected because of their psychoanalytic significance. It was believed that these stimulus words would be helpful in eliciting responses that would be indicative of internal psychological conflict. Kent andRosanoff(1910) had a different approach to the word association test. The test consists of 100 neutral words which were chosen because they tend to elicit the same reaction from most people unlike the words that were chosen byRapaport(Rapaportchose his words because they would help to elicit specific individual responses which would help to identify a person's internal conflicts). For instance, the word \"dark\" is usually responded to with \"light\". \"Table\" usually elicits the response \"chair\". Frequency tables were prepared which indicated how often a particular common response occurred for one stimulus in a standardization sample of 1000 normal adults. The Kent-Rosanofftest is scored fairly simply. An \"index of commonality\" is computed by determining how often the examinee's responses appeared in the frequency table. Any responses not found in the tables are designated \"individual\". When psychotics and normal's are compared, it is often found that psychotics obtain much lower indexes of commonality than normal's and also give more \"individual\" responses. Thus, the Kent-Rosanofftest may be helpful as a psychiatric screening instrument. The sentence completion test is another verbal projective technique. The sentence completion test permits an almost unlimited variety of responses.

This ability is basically due to the fact that we possess two ears which are located on opposite sides of our head. This enables us to localize sounds using time and intensity factors. It is most likely that one ear will be farther from a sound than the other is. Then the sound will reach one ear sooner than it reaches the second. Therefore, one ear will begin sending messages to the brain before the other. This time difference is noted as the auditory messages reach the brain. The brain can then use this information to determine where the sound came from. In addition, there are differences in the intensity or strength of a particular sound arriving at the two ears. In order to reach the ear that is farther away, a sound 'passes' the head. This decreases the strength of the sound. Consider the following example. If your mother yells at you and there is a wall between you, the sound will be much less intense than if the wall was not there. In a similar fashion, your head dampens the intensity of a stimulus on its way to the more distant ear. The difference in intensity created is again detected in the brain. The brain can then use this information to localize the original sound. The above factors provide us with rather reliable information regarding the direction a sound is coming from. This is especially so if the object is to the right or left of us. However, determining the distance of a sound source is more difficult. Psychological factors such as familiarity with the sound become important here. If you heard a church bell and a cricket's chirp of equal strength, you would say the church is much farther from you than the cricket. This is because you know church bells are loud relative to cricket chirps. You are familiar with them from previous experience. Thus if a church bell sounds as strong as a cricket's chirp, the bell must be located farther away. Psychological factors are also important in determining if an object is above or below us. This is how we determine that the roar of an airplane engine is coming from above us. The sound seems to be coming from all over.

This ability is basically due to the fact that we possess two ears which are located on opposite sides of our head. This enables us to localize sounds using time and intensity factors. It is most likely that one ear will be farther from a sound than the other is. Then the sound will reach one ear sooner than it reaches the second. Therefore, one ear will begin sending messages to the brain before the other. This time difference is noted as the auditory messages reach the brain. The brain can then use this information to determine where the sound came from. In addition, there are differences in the intensity or strength of a particular sound arriving at the two ears. In order to reach the ear that is farther away, a sound 'passes' the head. This decreases the strength of the sound. Consider the following example. If your mother yells at you and there is a wall between you, the sound will be much less intense than if the wall was not there. In a similar fashion, your head dampens the intensity of a stimulus on its way to the more distant ear. The difference in intensity created is again detected in the brain. The brain can then use this information to localize the original sound. The above factors provide us with rather reliable information regarding the direction a sound is coming from. This is especially so if the object is to the right or left of us. However, determining the distance of a sound source is more difficult. Psychological factors such as familiarity with the sound become important here. If you heard a church bell and a cricket's chirp of equal strength, you would say the church is much farther from you than the cricket. This is because you know church bells are loud relative to cricket chirps. You are familiar with them from previous experience. Thus if a church bell sounds as strong as a cricket's chirp, the bell must be located farther away. Psychological factors are also important in determining if an object is above or below us. This is how we determine that the roar of an airplane engine is coming from above us. The sound seems to be coming from all over. However, through previous experience we know that airplanes are unlikely to be beneath us. Therefore, the sound must be coming from above."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat part do \"heuristics\" play in the processing of sensory information?\n\nOptions:\nA.

But if this is so, how can we, for example, feel a touch on the arm? A touch is a physical action--not an electric impulse! Thus the question of how information from our environment can be translated into a message our brain \"understands\" is a crucial one in psychology. We realize that the appropriate information does reach the brain. The basic question, then, is \"How?\" The process whereby a physical stimulus from the environment is transformed into electrical activity which the brain understands is called 'sensory transduction'. This process takes place at the receptor cells of each sensory system. For example, in the visual system, the receptors are two types of cells called rods and cones. As light, the physical stimulus, hits these receptors, chemical changes take place within the cells. (In rod cells, the chemicalrhodopsinis converted toretineneandopsin). These chemical changes effect electrical changes which can be sensed by the nervous system, and a message concerning the stimulus involved is then sent to the brain. In summary, we have seen that in order for physical information from our environment to be translated into electrical activity \"understood\" by the brain, the process of sensory transduction is required. Study of this process is crucial to physiological psychology since it is at this level that our nervous system relates to our environment; it is by this process that the changes necessary to tell our brain \"what's going on\" take place.", "ref_id": 1993, "meta_info": {"subject": "psychology.csv", "src": "stemez-Psychology", "question": "What is sensory transduction and why is this process basic to the study of physiological psychology?", "options": ["Sensory transduction is the physical reaction to stimuli in the environment.", "Sensory transduction is the process of converting light into sound.", "Sensory transduction is the process whereby a physical stimulus from the environment is transformed into electrical activity which the brain understands.", "Sensory transduction is the process by which the brain converts electrical impulses into sensory input."], "answer": "C", "solution": "Our brain can only \"understand\" messages which are carried in an electrical form called 'electric impulses'.

Others feel that intelligence is an innate ability and that it is only quantitatively different in adulthood. Actually, it is probably more the case that the way intelligence is measured in early childhood differs from the way it is measured in adulthood.

Positive transfer, negative transfer, and zero transfer\nD. Transfer of elements, formal-discipline theory, and mental-faculty theory\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nTwo fundamentally different types of transfer of training need to be understood clearly. Suppose that a comedian has learned that his nightclub audiences roar with laughter whenever he tells jokes that ridicule religion. When he is invited to perform on a college campus, he relies on this kind of joke, and the students laugh uproariously. This is an example of positive transfer. What the comedian learned to do in one situation applies equally well in another. Suppose that the comedian is then invited to perform at a Christian Fellowship convention. His religious jokes, of course, fall flat, and his performance is a miserable failure. This is an example of negative transfer. What worked in one situation is not applicable to another. Researchers have studied the variables affecting transfer by using paired-associate learning in their experiments. For example, two groups, experimental and control, are compared for the amount of time taken and accuracy in learning a paired-associate task. Each experimental group first learns Task 1 consisting of a list of paired items (A and B). Then the experimental group learns Task 2 which is a second list of paired items (C and D). To see if learning Task 1 helped (transferred) the learning of Task 2, a control group is employed which does not learn Task 1 but must learn Task 2. The two groups are compared to assess which group performed better. Experimental grouplearn Task 1learn Task 2 Control groupRestlearn Task 2 If the experimental group does better on Task 2 than the control group, it can be assumed that the learning of Task 1 transferred positively to the learning of Task 2. This is called positive transfer. If, however, the experimental group does not do as well on Task 2 as the control group, it can be assumed that the learning of Task 1 somehow interfered with the learning of Task 2. This would be an indication that a negative transfer took place. It is also possible for zero transfer to occur. This is seen if the groups do not differ in their performances. This would indicate that the learning of Task 1 did not make any positive or negative difference in the learning of Task 2. It has been assumed that a certain degree of positive transfer takes place from what is learned in school to what is needed in daily life. Most researchers agree on \"transfer of elements,\" which is the type discussed above. But a general theory called \"formal-discipline theory\" is questioned. It proposes that only a limited number of mental faculties need to be trained; once trained, they can be used in a great variety of situations.

Another theory, the \"mental-faculty theory,\" which has almost been completely abandoned because experimentation has not supported it, proposes that one could train school children to be neat in their appearance and in their habits by teaching them to be neat in their schoolwork.
