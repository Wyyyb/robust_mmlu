G(s) converges to 1/s for all s\nD. The required Laplace transform is L{1} = s\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nConverting the improper integral in the problem to a limit of a proper integral, G(s) = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty^R\\int_0 e^-stdt(a) For s = 0, this becomes G(s) = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty ^R\\int_0 e^-(0)tdt = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty ^R\\int_0 dt = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty t \\vert^R_t=0 = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty R = \\infty.

If s > 0, then - Rs < 0 for positive R; hence, e^-Rs approaches zero as R approaches infinity, and the integral converges to 1/s. Extending the domain of the Laplace transform to complex values of s, we evaluate the expression e^-Rs by Euler's formula: e^-Rs = e-R(Re{s}) - iR(Im{s}) = e^-R(Re{s}) {cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})]},(c) where Re{s} is the real part of s, Im{s} is the imaginary part of s, and i \\equiv \\surd(- 1) is the imaginary constant. The cosine and sine functions are bounded; hence expression (c) diverges, as R \\rightarrow \\infty, for Re{s} < 0 and converges to zero for Re{s} > 0. In the case where s \\not = 0 and Re{s} = 0, we have e^-Rs(Re{s}) = 1; hence, e^-Rs = cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})], which is a nonconstant periodic function, making e^-Rs diverge as R \\rightarrow \\infty. Since e^-Rs is the only expression that varies with R in equality (b), its convergence properties for R \\rightarrow \\infty determine the convergence properties of G(s). Thus, in general, G(s) converges to 1/s for Re{s} > 0 and diverges otherwise. Using L as the Laplace transform operator, with L{f(t)} = F(s) = ^\\infty\\int_0 e^-st f(t)dt, we take the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1 for t \\geq 0: L{1} = ^\\infty\\int_0 (e^-st \\bullet 1 dt) =^\\infty\\int_0 e^-st dt, which is the same integral as G(s) in the problem.

If s > 0, then - Rs < 0 for positive R; hence, e^-Rs approaches zero as R approaches infinity, and the integral converges to 1/s. Extending the domain of the Laplace transform to complex values of s, we evaluate the expression e^-Rs by Euler's formula: e^-Rs = e-R(Re{s}) - iR(Im{s}) = e^-R(Re{s}) {cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})]},(c) where Re{s} is the real part of s, Im{s} is the imaginary part of s, and i \\equiv \\surd(- 1) is the imaginary constant. The cosine and sine functions are bounded; hence expression (c) diverges, as R \\rightarrow \\infty, for Re{s} < 0 and converges to zero for Re{s} > 0. In the case where s \\not = 0 and Re{s} = 0, we have e^-Rs(Re{s}) = 1; hence, e^-Rs = cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})], which is a nonconstant periodic function, making e^-Rs diverge as R \\rightarrow \\infty. Since e^-Rs is the only expression that varies with R in equality (b), its convergence properties for R \\rightarrow \\infty determine the convergence properties of G(s). Thus, in general, G(s) converges to 1/s for Re{s} > 0 and diverges otherwise. Using L as the Laplace transform operator, with L{f(t)} = F(s) = ^\\infty\\int_0 e^-st f(t)dt, we take the Laplace transform of f(t) = 1 for t \\geq 0: L{1} = ^\\infty\\int_0 (e^-st \\bullet 1 dt) =^\\infty\\int_0 e^-st dt, which is the same integral as G(s) in the problem.

The required Laplace transform is L{1} = (s), for Re{s) > 0\nD. G(s) converges to (1 / s) for Re{s) < 0 and diverges otherwise\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nBy definition, the improper integral in the problem is a limit of a proper integral G(s) = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty ^R\\int0e^-st dt.(1) For s = 0 this becomes G(s)= lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty ^R\\int0e^-(0)t dt = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty ^R\\int_0 dt = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty t \\vert^R_t=0 = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty R = \\infty. Hence, the integral G(s) diverges for s = 0. For s \\not = 0 equation (1) becomes G(s) = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty - [(1/s)e^-st] \\vert^R_t=0 = lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty (1 / s)(1 - e^-Rs) = (1 / s) - lim_R\\rightarrow\\infty [(e^-Rs) / s].(2) If s < 0, then - Rs > 0 for positive R; hence, e^-Rs approaches infinity as R approaches infinity, and the integral diverges. If s > 0, then - Rs < 0 for positive R; hence, e^-Rs approaches zero as R approaches infinity, and the integral converges to (1 / s). Extending the domain of the Laplace transform to complex values of s, we evaluate the expression of e^-Rs by Euler's formula: e^-Rs= e^-R(Re{s}) - iR(Im{s}) = e^-R(Re{s}) [cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})]],(3) where Re{s} is the real part of s, lm{s} is the imaginary part of s, and i \\equiv \\surd(- 1) is the imaginary constant. The cosine and sine functions are bounded; hence expression (3) diverges, as R \\rightarrow \\infty, for Re{s} < 0 and converges to zero for Re(s} > 0. In the case where s \\not = 0 and Re{s} = 0, we have e^-R(Re{s}) = 1; hence, e^-Rs = cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})], which is a nonconstant periodic function, so e^-Rs does not converge to any value as R \\rightarrow \\infty. Since e^-Rs is the only expression that varies with R in equality (2), its convergence properties for R \\rightarrow \\infty determine the convergence properties of G(s). Thus, in general, G(s) converges to (1 / s) for Re{s) > 0 and diverges otherwise.

If s > 0, then - Rs < 0 for positive R; hence, e^-Rs approaches zero as R approaches infinity, and the integral converges to (1 / s). Extending the domain of the Laplace transform to complex values of s, we evaluate the expression of e^-Rs by Euler's formula: e^-Rs= e^-R(Re{s}) - iR(Im{s}) = e^-R(Re{s}) [cos[- R(Im{s})] + i sin[- R(Im{s})]],(3) where Re{s} is the real part of s, lm{s} is the imaginary part of s, and i \\equiv \\surd(- 1) is the imaginary constant.

Some of themeristemcontinues to function in certain parts of the adult plant, and thus provides for continued growth.

Vitamin B deficiency causes increased energy levels\nD. Lack of B vitamins leads to impaired digestion\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nThe vitamin B complex includes (among others) thiamine (B1), riboflavin(B2) pyridoxine (B6), biotin, niacin or nicotinic acid,cobalamin (B12) andpantothenicacid.All these vitamins function as parts of coenzymesused in the oxidation of glucose to form ATP. Thiamine is an essential constituent of thiamine pyrophosphate, the coenzymeused in the oxidativedecarboxylationofpyruvicand \\alpha- ketoglutaricacids in the TCA cycle. Characteristics of mild deficiencies are: fatigue, loss of appetite and weakness. Severe deficien-cies enhance thesesymptoms and cause degeneration of nerves and muscle atrophy, a conditionknown as beriberi. Niacin is a component of two coenzymes, NAD+ and NADP+, which serveas hydrogen acceptors in reactions ofglycolysisand the TCA cycle. Deficiency of niacin causes stunted growth and the disease pellagra. Riboflavin forms part offlavinadeninedinucleotide(FAD), a coenzymeofsuccinicdehydrogenasein the TCA cycle. Deficiency results instunted growth, cracks in the corner of the mouth, and cornea damage. Pantothenicacid is especially important since it forms part of coenzymeA, and thus used in a number of reac-tions in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins.

A chemical reaction is the process of combining elements to form new compounds\nD. The rate-determining step is the fastest step in a reaction\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nA necessary requirement of a chemical reaction is that the products be chemically different from the reactants. Therefore a chemical reaction is one in which bonds are broken and/or formed. Some chemical reactions have only a single step, with only one bond being formed or broken. In multistep reactions, a certain sequence of bond formation and bond breakages proceed. Usually the formation of a chemical bond releases energy, and the products formed are more stable than the reactants, in that they have a lower potential energy. The breakage of a bond requires some form of energy which is absorbed by the bond, giving products that, together, will exist at a higher potential energy. Thus, a reaction that requires heat to proceed and usually involves breaking bonds is termed an endothermic reaction. A reaction that proceeds with the release of heat and usually involves forming bonds is termed an exothermic reaction. Aside from bond changes, there is a change in potential energy or enthalpy and there can be a change in entropy, or orderliness that accompanies the reaction. There is a tendency for chemical systems to go toward minimum energy or enthalpy and thus achieve maximum stability. There is also a tendency toward maximum disorder or entropy. These two concepts can be combined in a new function called free energy (G) , which is the energy that is available for doing work. G = \u2206H - T\u2206S , where \u2206Hrepresents the change in enthalpy \u2206Srepresents the change in entropy Tis the temperature in Kelvin \u2206Gis the spontaneous change in free energy In order for a chemical reaction to proceed, \u2206G must be negative. A loss in enthalpy will be represented by a negative \u2206H and a gain in entropy by a positive \u2206S. If \u2206G is positive, energy would have to be added to the system to drive the reaction forward. Most chemical reactions occurring in the living cell are not simple, one-step reactions. Many contain a series of consecutive steps coupled, or linked, by common intermediates with the product of the first step being the reactant in the second step, and the product of the second step is the reactant in the third, and so on. The \u2206G of such reactions is the sum of the \u2206G's of the individual steps. Each step of the reaction has its own activation energy, and the one requiring the highest activation complex is kinetically the most un-favorable one.

Since each tetrad has 4 chromatids, there are a total of 4 \u00d7 4 or 16 chromatids in the tetrad stage. b) In latetelophaseof the first meiotic division, the homologous chromosomes of each pair have separated.

If we measure both the oxygen consumptionand carbon dioxide release by the body, we can determine whethercarbohydrates, fats, or proteins are being used for respiratory needs.

This indicates that more oxygen is necessaryto break down a fat than a carbohydrate molecule.

Stomata are open during the day for respiration and close at night to allow photosynthesis.\nD. Stomata open and close randomly without any specific advantage.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nDuring the day, the plant undergoes photosynthesis, a process which converts carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates.This results in a drop of the carbon dioxide content of the cell as carbon dioxide is used up. When this happens, the acidity of the cell decreases, promoting the conversion of the insoluble starch to the soluble glucose. This can be explained by the fact that the cellular enzymes that catalyze the conversion of starch to glucose do not function in acidic surroundings. During the night hours, production of carbon dioxide occurs during respiration . In addition, no carbon dioxide is depleted by photosynthe-sis which occurs only during the day. This results in a high carbon dioxide level in the cells. When its levels are high, carbon dioxide will combine with water to form carbonic acid. This will inhibit the conversion of starch to sugar, due to a decrease in thepH.When the carbon dioxide level in the cell is as low as it is during the daytime when photosynthesis occurs, much of the carbonic acid is reconverted to carbon dioxide and water, increasing the alkalinity of the cell and thus raising thepH.The greater alkalinity of the plant cells during the day brings about a higher cellular glucose concentration with the reverse true at night. During the day, the high cellular concentration of glucose causes water to enter the guard cells by osmosis, rendering them turgid. The turgor of the guard cells cause them to bend, opening the stoma as a result . At night, the acidity of the cell inhibits the break-down of starch. Since starch is insoluble in the cell sap, it does not exert an osmotic pressure. In the ab-sence of osmotic pressure, the guard cells lose theirturgor, causing them to collapse and close the stoma. What then is the purpose of having the stoma open in the day and closed at night? In the daytime, when the leaves are photosynthesizing, the carbon dioxide supply in the cell is constantly being depleted and its supply must be replenished in order to maintain photosynthe-sis. Thus it is highly advantageous to have the stomata open during the day, in order for carbon dioxide mole-cules to enter the leaf from the atmosphere through the stomata. Open stomata also result in continuous transpiration, hence the air spaces of the leaf are al-ways kept moist for carbon dioxide to dissolve in.

The tree will die because it gets infected through the cut\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nWhen a ring is cut through the bark down to the wood of a tree, the vascular system is being separated into two halves. Water moves continuously upward in the xylem in response to osmotic pressure build-up in the roots, transpiration and capillary action. Severing the xylem will prevent the upper region of the tree from obtaining water from the roots by the processes mentioned. The upper half of the tree, deprived of further supply of water could however continue to carry on photosynthesis using as much of the remaining water and minerals as it has stored in the upper half of the bisected xylem.

This reduced turgidity causes the guard cells to collapse, closing the stomata in an attempt to prevent further water loss through the stomata. What this indicates is that even though photosynthesis could theoretically be maintained in the upper region temporarily on stored nutrients and water, this usually does not occur.

Castration alters the learning ability of animals\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nIn simple behavior, animals respond to a particular stimulus in the environmentwith an appropriate response. However, few animals respond soautomatically; stereotyped behavior can be modified. Sometimes the animaldoes not respond; sometimes it responds differently than expected. Its actions often depend on other control-ling factors, such as hormone levelsand previous experi-ence. This question involves the use of these twofactors in modifying sexual behavior. Hormones modify behavior by affecting the level of an animal's motivationalstate. They alter the animal's physiology, which can then alter behavioralpatterns. For example, the breeding term in birds is initiated by physiologicalchanges in the reproductive organs which produce the sex hormones. These sex hormones cause the development of special breedingplumage which subsequent-ly affects reproductive behavior. The malehormones also induce courtship displays like bowing and cooing uponsight of the female. The female responds to these court-ing displays bythe release of its own reproductive hormones which affect, egg production. Eventually nest building occurs and copulation results. In each stepof this reproductive behavior, hormones lead to behavior acts which causefurther release of other hormones di-recting further behavior. However, as animals have evolved, there is less hormone-directed behavior, and more learned responses. Learning is the change in behavior asa result of ex-perience. Only higher animals with larger and more complexbrains demonstrate the process of learning. Learning affects man'sbehavior, very little of which is stereotyped.

The liver only detoxifies harmful substances.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nOne of the most important functions of the liver is to regulate the levelof glucose in the blood stream. The maintenance of a constant level ofblood glucose is essential because specialized cells, such as the brain cells, are easily damaged by slight fluctuations in glucose levels. Excess glucoseis stored in the liver as glycogen while declining blood glucose canbe restored by conversion of liver glycogen into glucose.

Genetic drift has increased over time\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe communities that man lived in about twenty thousand years ago all had something in common - they all were very small villages. The total world population then was low and people living in these small social groups were relatively distant from people in other places. With no means of transportation and the danger of traveling alone, people tended to stay close to their shelters. As a result, most breeding took place within individual social groups with each probably ranging up to about 100 members. In other words, these people were probably genetically similar for in inbreeding, no genes could be exchanged with other populations that existed. As an illustration, we can consider the western European Neanderthal people who were cut off from the rest of the world population by geographic factors. They were no longer able to exchange genes and consequently their further evolution was independent. Thus, they were sheltered from different genes present in the world's gene pool. These people became more unlike the rest of the world population and more like each other.

Sunlight, soil type, and plant species\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nA number of different factors affect the rate of transpiration. The most important of these is temperature. Because temperature is a measurement of the average molecular kinetic energy, a high temperature heating up the plant body will provide the water molecules within the leaves with increased internal energy, and many of them may soon gainadequate kinetic energy to enter the gaseous phase and escape into the atmosphere . The higher the temperature rises, the greater will be the rate of transpiration, all other factors remaining constant.

The most important of these is temperature. Because temperature is a measurement of the average molecular kinetic energy, a high temperature heating up the plant body will provide the water molecules within the leaves with increased internal energy, and many of them may soon gainadequate kinetic energy to enter the gaseous phase and escape into the atmosphere .

Stomata respond to environmental factors by changing their size and shape\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nA number of environmental factors affectstomatalopening and closing. Water loss is the most important among them. When theturgorof a leaf drops below a certain critical point because of rapid evapo-ration to the atmosphere, thestomatalaperture responds to this loss by becoming smaller or closed. In this situation, the need for water conservation overrides the need for the intake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. With the stomata closed, the leaf cells can use the carbon dioxide produced by their respiration, and thus be able to sustain a very low level of photosynthesis. Factors other than water loss that affect the stomata include light, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. It has been shown that when a turgid leaf which has been kept in darkness for a few hours is exposed to light, the stomata open. When the light is switched off, the stomata close. Light apparently plays a role in the opening and closing of the stomata. Light is now believed to initiate a series of enzymatic reactions which break down insoluble starch to many smaller, soluble glucose molecules in the guard cells of a stoma. As the solute concentration increases, water enters the guard cells by osmosis, increasing theirturgor, thereby opening the stomata. The role of carbon dioxide is similar to that of light, in the opening and closing of the stomata. It is found experimentally that a decrease in carbon dioxide increases the pH in a cell and an increase in pH facilitates the conversion of starch to glucose. This is explained by the fact that the enzymephosphorylaseis stimulated by the increased pH to convert starch to glucose-l-phosphate, which is in turn converted to glucose. As discussed earlier, water now enters the leaf cells,turgorpressure increases and as the guard cells bend, the stomata open. Temperature also fits into this scheme because of its influence on carbon dioxide concentration. An increase in temperature increases the rate of respiration, and so increases in turn the cellular carbon dioxide level. A decrease in temperature, on the other hand, retards respiration, and thus decreases the cellular carbon dioxide levels.

These social groups, as they are referred to by anthropologists, are highly organized and structured. These primates grow up with similar life cycles: (1) a prenatal stage, (2) birth, (3) infancy, (4) childhood, (5) adolescence, and (6) adult-hood. All higher primates usually space their births from 2 to 5 years apart for adequate nutrition and proper maternal care. As one ascends the evolutionary ladder of primates, there is observed a lengthening of period in which the offspring remains dependent on the mother. The lengthened prenatal and infancy periods might be necessary in the higher primates for proper development of the nervous system, which is characteristically highly complex, especially in certain regions of the brain. After birth the young stay with their mothers for a relatively long time compared to other animals. During infancy and childhood, chimpanzees, gorillas and man are relatively devoid of responsibilities.

These peer play groups are very important in that discrete behaviors learned in this en-vironment will help to ensure the groups continued existence.

Here, microorganisms are prime experimental subjects, because of their extremely rapid rate of reproduction. Generations can be obtained in a matter of hours, and so genetic experiments can be done in relatively short periods of time. Large populations can be quickly grown, enabling rare events, such as mutations, to occur in observable quantities. Also, determination of genetic frequencies becomes extremely accurate with large numbers. Microorganisms are easily obtained and stored. They live on inexpensive nutrients. This makes them perfectly suited to laboratory studies . In laboratories, the environment can be carefully controlled, and by selecti-vely varying the culture media, one can easily study specific factors of metabolism. Single mutant cells can be isolated from among millions by simply varying the nutrient media. Most of what we know about genes is learned from observations of their phenotypic expressions, and in this respect microorganisms display their biggest ad-vantage. Many microorganism, particularly fungi, have a conspicuous and relatively long - lived haploid generation. In the haploid stage (n), there is only one set of genetic information; that set is expressed phenotypically, whether it be dominant or recessive. In the diploid stage, dominant alleles may mask recessive ones, and the genotype cannot be accurately determined solely from the phenotype. Lengthy procedures such as back - crosses are required to deduce the genotype , but can be eliminated if the test subjects are haploid individuals. Much of recent genetics has involved both micros-copic chromosomal studies and gene effects at the cellular level. Here, the simplicity of the genetic material and metabolism of microorganisms makes them much better candidates for such studies than the complex multicellular organisms.", "ref_id": 1297, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Biology", "question": "What advantages do microorganisms have over largerforms of life as subjects for genetic investigation?", "options": ["Microorganisms are prime experimental subjects for genetic investigation due to their extremely rapid rate of reproduction, large populations, cost-effectiveness, and simplicity of their genetic material and metabolism.", "Microorganisms have no advantage over larger forms of life.", "Microorganisms are difficult to breed and reproduce.", "Microorganisms are more complex than larger forms of life."], "answer": "A", "solution": "If we consider the methods by which genetic studies are carried out , the advantages of using micro-organisms such as bacteria become obvious .

Describe the function of each essential vitamin needed by the human body.\n\nOptions:\nA. Vitamins are relatively simple organic compounds required in minute quantities and not used as an energy source. They serve as coenzymes or as parts of coenzymes.\nB. Vitamins are used as an energy source\nC.             Vitamins are complex carbohydrates\nD. Vitamins are required in large amounts\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nVitamins are relatively simple organic com-pounds required in minute quantities and not used as an energy source. Vitamins are required in very small quantities because they serve as coenzymes or as parts of coenzymes. A coenzyme is a substance required by an enzyme for catalytic activity. Since coenzymes, like enzymes, are not altered in a reaction and may be used repeatedly, and for more than one enzyme, only small amounts are needed. There are two principal groups of vitamins: the fat- soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and the water-soluble vitamins (B complex and C). Vitamin A is necessary for the growth and maintenance of the epithelial cells of the skin, various tracts in the body and the eye. It is also a precursor to the visual pigment,retinaldehyde, in the eye. A deficiency of vitamin A results in lowered resistance of skin to infection and in night blindness. Vitamin D can be synthesized by the skin in the presence of ultraviolet light. Vitamin D is required for normal growth of the skeleton and teeth because it controls the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. Malforma-tion of the bones, known as rickets, is associated with a lack of vitamin D. Some vitamins needed by man vitamin Some deficiency symptoms Important sources FAT-SOLUBLE Vitamin A (retinol) Dry. brittle epithelia of skin, respiratory system, andurogenitaltract; night blindness and malformed rods Green and yellow vegetables and fruit, dairy products, egg yolk, fish-liver oil Vitamin D (calciferol) Rickets orosteomalacia( very low blood calcium level, soft bones, distorted skeleton, poor muscular development) Egg yolk, milk, fish oils Vitamin E (tocopherol) Male sterility in rats (and perhaps other animals); muscular dystrophy in some animals; abnormal red blood cells in infants; death of rat and chicken embryos Widely distributed in both plant and animal food, e.g. meat, egg yolk, green vegetables, seed oils Vitamin K Slow blood clotting and hemorrhage Green vegetables WATER - SOLUBLE Thiamine (B1) Beriberi (muscle atrophy, paralysis, mental confusion, congestive heart failure) Whole-grain cereals, yeast, nuts, liver, pork Riboflavin (B2) Vascularization of the cornea, conjunctivitis, and disturbances of vision; sores on the lips and tongue; disorders of liver and nerves in experimental animals Milk, cheese, eggs, yeast, liver, wheat germ, leafy vegetables Pyridoxine (B6) Convulsions, dermatitis, impairment of antibody synthesis Whole grains, fresh meat, eggs, liver, fresh vegetables Pantothenic acid Impairment of adrenal cortical function, numbness and pain in toes and feet, impairment of antibody synthesis Present in almost all foods, especially fresh vegetables and meat, whole grains, eggs Biotin Clinical symptoms in man are extremely rare, but can be produced by great excess of raw egg white in diet; symptoms are dermatitis, conjunctivitis Present in many foods, including liver, yeast, fresh vegetables Nicotinamide Pellagra (dermatitis, diarrhea, irritability, abdominal pain, numbness, mental disturbance) Meat, yeast, whole wheat Folic acid Anemia, impairment of antibody synthesis, stunted growth in young animals Leafy vegetables, liver Cobalamin (B12) Pernicious anemia Liver and other meats Ascorbic acid (C) Scurvy (bleeding gums, loose teeth, anemia, painful and swollen joints, delayed healing of wounds, emaciation) Citrus fruits, tomatoes Vitamin E is important in some animals in maintaining good muscle condition and normal liver function. In addi-tion, vitamin E has been shown to be necessary in prevent-ing sterility in many test animals including rats, chickens and ducks. A deficiency of vitamin E produces progressive deterioration and paralysis of the muscles, abnormal red blood cells in infants, and male sterility in some animals. A deficiency of this vitamin rarely occurs in man. Vitamin K plays an important role in the normal co-agulation of blood by promoting synthesis in the liver ofprothrombinandproconvertin. These are two factors of the blood-clotting system. Vitamin K-deficient patients are highly susceptible to hemorrhages. Bacteria living in the large intestine of man are capable of producing vitamin K. Vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, is required in cellular metabolism, specifically in cellular reductions. It is also important in the formation ofhydroxyproline, one of the constituents of collagen. The disease scurvy, resulting from a lack of this vitamin, is characterized by bleeding gums, bruised skin, painful swollen joints and general weakness. Vitamin B complex is a group of water-soluble com-pounds, unrelated chemically but which tend to be associ-ated together. Several of them act as parts of coenzymes functioning in cellular respiration. For example, thiamine (vitamin B1) is a principal part of the coenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation ofpyruvicacid. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is one of the hydrogen-carriers in the oxida-tivecytochromesystem.

His explanation is that thepseudoallelesrepresent mutations atdifferent sites within acistron. A gene would then function normally if it wasnonmutant. But a mutation would result in a changed or absent gene product.Pontecorvoalso said that a single gene (cistron) could break by recombination. Thus, the recombination could account for these pseudoallelesappearing on both the same and different chromosomes. Although both interpretations are valid, the second has been more widely accepted, since proof of interaction of gene products must be identified for thefirst explanation to hold."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nOver the past two decades retroviruses have profoundly im-pacted the growing field of molecular biology.

If added during cell division, the spindle will not form. The chromosomes will not be able to separate and migrate to separate poles. When the nuclear membrane reforms, apolyploidnucleus is the result. By manipulating their plants in this way, plant breeders can control theeuploidyof their nuclei. There are several advantages to this procedure. First, by doubling the chromosomes of amonoploidnucleus, a diploid, homozygous for all of its gene pairs, is produced. The production of such a genetically pure organism by inbreeding is extremely time consuming. Secondly, somepolyploidshave phenotypes that are more desirable than their corresponding diploids. As a result, many disease resistant strains of plants have been developed.Nicotianatobacumis resistant to the tobacco mosaic virus which produces lesions on the leaves of the plant.Polyploidindividuals also can produce larger fruits and flowers.

If added during cell division, the spindle will not form. The chromosomes will not be able to separate and migrate to separate poles. When the nuclear membrane reforms, apolyploidnucleus is the result. By manipulating their plants in this way, plant breeders can control theeuploidyof their nuclei. There are several advantages to this procedure. First, by doubling the chromosomes of amonoploidnucleus, a diploid, homozygous for all of its gene pairs, is produced. The production of such a genetically pure organism by inbreeding is extremely time consuming. Secondly, somepolyploidshave phenotypes that are more desirable than their corresponding diploids. As a result, many disease resistant strains of plants have been developed.Nicotianatobacumis resistant to the tobacco mosaic virus which produces lesions on the leaves of the plant.Polyploidindividuals also can produce larger fruits and flowers. Thetetraploidwatermelon, with 44 chromosomes, is larger than the normal watermelon.

Simple diffusion cannot occur against a concentration gradient\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nSimple diffusion cannot account for the passage of all of the dissolved minerals into the cells of water plants. Plant cells frequently contain minerals in higher concentration than those available in the soil or water in which they are growing. Simple diffusion of materials into the cells cannot occur against a con-centration gradient. Sometimes this gradient can be very steep. Studies of the vacuolar sap ofNitellaclavata, a pond plant, for instance, have shown that the concentration of mineral anions in the sap exceeds that in the pond by 10^4 times!

A dominant gene produces its effect in both the homozygousand heterozygous states. Geneticists, however, have found thatmany genes do not always produce their phenotypes when they should. Genes that always produce the expected phenotype in individuals whocarry the gene in an expressible combination are said to have completepenetrance.

It left the nucleotides with their 3' phosphate group (if they had one), and their 5' hydroxyl group. We now have enough information to piece together this stretch of RNA. Starting with the most acidic fragment, notice that the adenine residue has both a 5' and a 3' phosphate.

Alveolar air contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe respiratory tract is composed of conduct-ing airways and the alveoli. Gas exchange occurs only in the alveoli and not in the conducting airways. The maximum alveolar volume is about 500 ml. Let us consider then what takes place during expiration. Five hundred milliliters of air is forced out of the alveoli, and into the conducting airways of the respiratory tract. Of this air, 150 ml. remains in the respiratory airways following expiration, while 350 ml. of air is exhaled from the body. During the next inspiration 500 ml. of air are taken up by the alveoli, but 150 ml. of this air is not atmospheric, but rather is the air that remained in the tubes following the previous expiration. One can see, then, that only 350 ml. of fresh atmospheric air enters the alveoli during each inspiration. At the end of inspiration, 150 ml. of fresh air also fills the airways but does not reach the alveoli. Hence no gas exchange between this air and the blood can occur. This fresh air will be expelled from the body during the next expiration, and will be replaced again with 150 ml. of alveolar air, thus completing the cycle. From this cycle it can be seen that of the 500 ml. of air entering the body during inspiration, 150 ml. of it never reaches the alveoli, but instead remains in the con-ducting tubes of the respiratory system. The term \"anatomical dead space\" is given to the space within the conducting tubes because no gas exchange with the blood can take place there. The question arises then, as to the significance of this dead space. Because the tubes are not completely emptied and filled with each breath, \"new\" air can mix with \"old\" air. Consequently, alveolar air contains less oxygen and more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air.

Digestive enzyme secretion is regulated by the presence of food\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nDigestive enzyme secretion is regulated by two kinds of factors: neuralandhumoral(hormonal). Neural control is usually based upon the sensingof a physical mass of food. The stretching of the digestive tract (distension), is an example of thistyupeof stimulation. It is interest-ing to notethat most of the salivary and sane of the gas-tric secretions sure stimulatedby smelling, tasting and even thinking of food. Hormonal control, on the other hand, is much more specific. The presence of specific kindsof mole-cules in the ingested food stimulates receptor cells to producetheir specific hormone. The hormone circulates in the blood until itreaches thesecretoryorgans which it con-trols . Allsecretoryorgans are under the influence of several factors. The presenceof food in the mouth initiates gastric secretions by the stomach. When the food reaches the stomach, the distension of the stomach walls stimulatesan increase in stomach motion and the partial production of gastrin. The hormonegastrinhas several effects, the major of which is the stimulationof gastric juice secretion. It achieves this by stimulating gastric HClsecretion, which in turn induces protease activity.Pepsin, present in thegastric juice, cleaves proteins into many smaller chains. These small peptidechains stimulate receptor cells in theantrumof the stomach to producemoregastrin.Gastrinalso has the ability to stimulate limited secretionin the intestine and pancreas. Inadditon,gastrinstimulates an increasein gastric motility and helps keep the sphincter of the esophagus tightlyclosed. When partially digested food, orchyme, reaches the duodenum, its physicalpresence initiates peristalsis over the entire intestine. In addition, theacid in thechymecauses receptor cells to release the hormone secretin.Secretinhas many functions. It slows down stomach motion and decreasesgastric juice andgastrinproduction. This effectively keeps the foodin the stomach for a longer period. At the same time,secretin preparesthe intestine for neutralization of the acidicchymeby stimulating therelease of alkaline bicarbonate ions in pancreatic juice. Other receptor cells in the duodenum sense free amino acids and fats. These cells release a hormone calledcholecystokininor CCK. CCK stimulatesthe release of a pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes while slowingdown the motion in the stomach. The more fat and protein there is ina meal, the longer will digestion occur. A re-view of the regulatory activitiesof gastrointestinal hormones is given in the accompanying table. Note that CCK andsecretinact synergistically.

Secretinstimulates se-cretion of a juice high in bicarbonate, but it accentuatesCCK's secretion of a juice high in enzymes. The control of secretions in digestion is a complex interaction of severalfactors. One's emotional state, as well as physical health, have a greatinfluence on digestion.

Chromosomal breaks are modified by temperature and pressure\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nEnergy is required to disrupt the relatively stable chromosome. Any form of high energy radiation can provide sufficient energy to break a chromosome. Factors such as radiation frequency, ion density, length of exposure, and chromosome state can determine how effectively a chromosome is broken. The effective power depends on the frequency of the radiation. Higher frequency radiation, such as ultraviolet light, is more effective than the lower frequency visible light. X-rays and gamma rays, having even higher frequencies than ultraviolet rays, are much more effective chromosome breakers. Another factor that influences the breakage is the length and density of the ion track which varies according to the type of ionizing radiation. Ions break the chromosome by breaking bonds between atoms. Molecules are formed by shared atomic electrons. Ionizing radiation knocks out the electrons, thus ionizing the affected atom. If the electrons that are knocked out are those that are shared in a molecule, then the molecule will no longer hold together. Thus, the more concentrated the track of ions, the more harmful the radiation is to chromosomal molecules. Ion clusters can also produce more than one break in a chromosome by attacking it in separate, independent tracks.

The frequency of the recessive gene will fluctuate unpredictably.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nSince there are only two alleles involved, and we know that the sum of their frequencies must be one, we can calculate the frequency of the dominant gene (R) in the population. Letting p equal the frequency of R, and q equal the frequency of r (which is known to be 0.5), p + q = 1 p = 1 - q p = 1 - 0.5 p = 0.5 We can now use the Hardy-Weinberg binomial expansion to determine the corresponding genotype frequencies after one generation.

Eighty percent of these will be lost to the population before reproductive age. Thus, the number ofrrindividuals in the population will, in effect, be only 20 percent of what it originally was. The effect that this will have on actual gene frequencies can best be seen be first converting the frequencies to actual individual numbers. For convenience sake, let us assume an original population of 100. The original number ofrrindividuals is (0.25) (100) or 25. Loss of 80 percent of these would give a final effective number of 25 - (0.8) (25) = 25 - 20 = 5. The new frequencies now are calculated for an effective total population of 100 - 20, or 80.

Twins studies provide controls for both the effect of environment and heredity on the expression of a trait.\nB. Twins studies are only useful for studying physical traits.\nC.             Twins studies only show the effect of heredity on traits.\nD. Twins studies are used to study the effect of diet on traits.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nAlthough both environment and heredity are involved in the development of any trait, a change in some aspect of the environment may alter one characteristic relatively little as compared to its effect on another characteristic. An individual's blood type, for example, seems fairly impervious to practically all environmental effects, while the phenotype of a diabetic can be radically changed by a mere alteration in diet. Moreover, not all characteristics are determined by simple genetic effects which have easily observable relationships with simple environmental changes. Some traits, such as intelligence in animals, are probably determined by complex genetic-environmental interactions, the results of which are then viewed as a single trait. Performing studies using twins is one way of determining the relative contributions of genetic composition and environment to the expression of a given trait. There are two kinds of twins; identical (or monozygotic) twins, which arise from a single fertilized egg, and fraternal (ordizygotic) twins, which result from the fertilization of two separate eggs. From this definition we can see that monozygotic twins are genetically the same in every respect, whiledizygotictwins may differ genetically for any characteristic. By comparing both kinds of twins with regard to a particular trait, we can evaluate the roles of environment and heredity on the development of that characteristic. On the one hand we have genetically identical individuals of the same age and sex, raised in a single uterine environment; and on the other hand we have genetically dissimilar individuals of the same age, though not necessarily of the same sex, raised in a common uterine environment. Presumably the difference between these two kinds of twins is only the extent of their genetic similarity. Using twins for genetic studies, then, provides built-in controls for both the effect of environment and the effect of heredity on the expression of a given trait. For example, if phenotypic similarities for a particular characteristic are greater among identical twins than among fraternal twins, we can ascribe this to the genetic similarity of the identical pair and the genetic dissimilarity of the fraternal pair. On the other hand, if both identical and fraternal pairs show the same extent of phenotypic differences for a particular characteristic, we can assume that genetic similarity or dissimilarity plays less of a role than the differences which may occur in the post-uterine environment of the twins. As a concrete illustration of this, consider a pair of monozygotic twins reared in different postnatal environments and a pair ofdizygotictwins reared in a common postnatal environment. If the monozygotic twins were found to exhibit a wide range of dissimilarities and thedizygotictwins a significant range of similarities, the importance of the environment as a phenotypic modifier of the genetic composition of an individual can readily be appreciated.", "ref_id": 1343, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Genetics", "question": "In what ways are studies of twins useful in supplying information about the relative importance of inheritance and environment in the determination of a given trait?", "options": ["Twins studies provide controls for both the effect of environment and heredity on the expression of a trait.", "Twins studies are only useful for studying physical traits.", "Twins studies only show the effect of heredity on traits.", "Twins studies are used to study the effect of diet on traits."], "answer": "A", "solution": "Although both environment and heredity are involved in the development of any trait, a change in some aspect of the environment may alter one characteristic relatively little as compared to its effect on another characteristic. An individual's blood type, for example, seems fairly impervious to practically all environmental effects, while the phenotype of a diabetic can be radically changed by a mere alteration in diet. Moreover, not all characteristics are determined by simple genetic effects which have easily observable relationships with simple environmental changes. Some traits, such as intelligence in animals, are probably determined by complex genetic-environmental interactions, the results of which are then viewed as a single trait. Performing studies using twins is one way of determining the relative contributions of genetic composition and environment to the expression of a given trait. There are two kinds of twins; identical (or monozygotic) twins, which arise from a single fertilized egg, and fraternal (ordizygotic) twins, which result from the fertilization of two separate eggs. From this definition we can see that monozygotic twins are genetically the same in every respect, whiledizygotictwins may differ genetically for any characteristic. By comparing both kinds of twins with regard to a particular trait, we can evaluate the roles of environment and heredity on the development of that characteristic. On the one hand we have genetically identical individuals of the same age and sex, raised in a single uterine environment; and on the other hand we have genetically dissimilar individuals of the same age, though not necessarily of the same sex, raised in a common uterine environment. Presumably the difference between these two kinds of twins is only the extent of their genetic similarity. Using twins for genetic studies, then, provides built-in controls for both the effect of environment and the effect of heredity on the expression of a given trait. For example, if phenotypic similarities for a particular characteristic are greater among identical twins than among fraternal twins, we can ascribe this to the genetic similarity of the identical pair and the genetic dissimilarity of the fraternal pair. On the other hand, if both identical and fraternal pairs show the same extent of phenotypic differences for a particular characteristic, we can assume that genetic similarity or dissimilarity plays less of a role than the differences which may occur in the post-uterine environment of the twins. As a concrete illustration of this, consider a pair of monozygotic twins reared in different postnatal environments and a pair ofdizygotictwins reared in a common postnatal environment.

Dryopithecus is the most likely ancestor of the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan and man.

Complete equilibrium in a gene pool can always be achieved\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nOf the four conditions necessary for the genetic equilibrium described by the Hardy-Weinberg Law, the first, large population size, is met reasonably often; the second, absence of mutations, is never met; the third, no migration, is met sometimes; the fourth, random reproduction, is rarely met in real situations. Therefore, it follows that complete equilibrium in a gene pool is not expected. With regard to the first condition, many natural populations are so large that chance alone is not likely to cause any appreciable alteration in gene frequencies in their gene pools. Any breeding population with more than 10,000 members of breeding age is probably not significantly affected by random changes. The second condition for genetic equilibrium - the absence of mutations - is never met in any population because spontaneous mutations are always occurring. Most genes probably undergo mutation once in every 50,000 to 1,000,000 duplications, with the rate of mutation for different genes varying greatly. However, since the rate of spontaneous mutation is usually low, it is usually insignificant in altering the gene frequencies in a large population. The third condition for genetic equilibrium implies that a gene pool cannot exchange its genes with the outside. Immigration or emigration of individuals would change the gene frequencies in the gene pool. A high percentage of natural populations, however, experience some amount of migration. This factor, which enhances variation, tends to upset the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The fourth condition - random reproduction - refers not only to the indiscriminate selection of a mate but also to a host of other requirements that contribute to success in propagating the viable offspring. Such factors include the fertility of the mating pair, and the survival of the young to reproductive age. An organism's genotype actually influences its selection of a mate, the physical efficiency and frequency of its mating, its fertility, and so on. Thus, entirely random reproduction in reality is not possible. We can conclude, therefore, that if any of the conditions of the Hardy-Weinberg Law are not met, then the gene pool of a population will not be in equilibrium and there will be an accompanying change in gene frequency for that population. Since it is virtually impossible to have a population existing in genetic equilibrium, even with animals under laboratory conditions, there must then be a continuous process of changing genetic constitutions in all populations.

The factors include the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe sickle-cell disease is a homozygous recessive trait that usually results in death before reproductive age. In the heterozygous form, the sickle--cell gene is not harmful enough to cause death, but is instead beneficial in certain environments because it gives the carrier an immunity to malaria. In Africa, malaria is a severe problem and the heterozygous indivi-duals have a survival advantage over their fellow Africans. Therefore, the frequency of the sickle-cell gene has been kept fairly constant in the gene pool in Africa. In America, where the incidence of malaria is in-significant, an individual carrying the sickle-cell gene has no survival advantage, and the sickle-cell allele is slowly being lost and diluted in the population.

In Africa, malaria is a severe problem and the heterozygous indivi-duals have a survival advantage over their fellow Africans. Therefore, the frequency of the sickle-cell gene has been kept fairly constant in the gene pool in Africa.

The marine worms often have incomplete septa, and the leeches have lost the septa completely. Except for a few specialized head and tail segments, the appendages and musculature of all segments are exactly the same.

Onycophora (Peripatusand relatives) is a very small phylum showing segmentation. Theonycophoranshave a com-bination of annelid and arthropod characteristics, and provide an evolutionary link between these two phyla. Theonycophoranshave many similar segments with 14 to 43 pairs of short,unjointedlegs. Arthropods are a large group of segmented animals that have evolved in many complex ways.

More advanced forms have appendages modified for a variety of functions such as sensory antennae, feeding apparatus, walking legs, swimming legs, claws, reproductive apparatus, and respiratory structures, depending upon the species.

These arthropods also have a fusion of body segments into distinct regions, such as a head and trunk, or head, thorax and abdomen.

Internally, each segment has a pair of excretory organs and its own ventral nerve ganglion. The earthworm has five pairs of muscular tube-like hearts, two pairs of testes, three pairs of seminal vesicles, and one to five pairs of seminal receptacles. Molluscsexhibit embryonic development very similar to that of annelids, and the larval form, called thetrochophore, is very similar in both phyla. This similar-ity suggests a possible evolutionary relationship betweenmolluscsand annelids.Neopilinais the only living species of molluscs showing segmentation; it may, however, only be secondary. Onycophora (Peripatusand relatives) is a very small phylum showing segmentation. Theonycophoranshave a com-bination of annelid and arthropod characteristics, and provide an evolutionary link between these two phyla. Theonycophoranshave many similar segments with 14 to 43 pairs of short,unjointedlegs. Arthropods are a large group of segmented animals that have evolved in many complex ways. More primitive forms have paired, similar appendages oneaahsegment. More advanced forms have appendages modified for a variety of functions such as sensory antennae, feeding apparatus, walking legs, swimming legs, claws, reproductive apparatus, and respiratory structures, depending upon the species. The more advanced arthropods have a greatly reduced number of segments. These arthropods also have a fusion of body segments into distinct regions, such as a head and trunk, or head, thorax and abdomen. Internally, there is a great deal of specialization, and septa between segments have been lost. The first six segments always form a head, usually with a well-developed brain and sense organs. In primitive forms there are ganglia in every segment, but in many groups the ganglia have fused to formganglionic masses. Aquatic arthropods may have one pair or several pairs of excretory organs, orcoxalglands. In most groups of terrestrial arthropods, the excretory organs areMalpighiantubules. Generally, there is only one pair of reproductive organs; centipedes, however may have 24 testes. Chordata is the other phylum characterized by segmen-tation. As with the arthropods, there also has been in-creasing specialization of segments in chordates. In man, the nervous system and the skeletal system aresegmentallyorganized. In primitive fish, the gills and musculature are also segmented."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nHow is the mating response in houseflies,Muscadomestica, controlled?\n\nOptions:\nA.

Translation of the origi-nal genes also stops and the heat shock genes are preferentially translated. This event occurs in Drosophila, yeast, corn, and cul-tured mammalian cells. Drosophila's giant salivary gland chromo-somes show nine new chromosomal puffs as a result of high tem-peratures. How this regulation is achieved is not known. But four heat shock genes have been cloned and sequenced. They have promoter regions and areas of imperfect dyad symmetry upstream from the promot-ers. These areas are perfect places for regulatory proteins to bind, since many known controlling elements have such symmetry."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nMiniature poodles are thought to have a mean height of 12 inches and a standard deviation of 1.8 inches.
