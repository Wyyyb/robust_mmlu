This interest is added to the principal at regular intervals. Mr.Beame'sinterest is being compounded semiannually. That means we are adding the interest to the principal twice a year. To compute how much the interest was for a two year period, we must break it up into 4 six month periods, so we can add the interest to the principal every six months.

Also, 4 interest periods per year for 3 years is a total of 12 periods. Using the Compound Interest Table, the factor for the 12 interest periods at a per period interest rate of 1% (correct to 6 decimals) is 1.126825.

The constraints are: (1) X \\geq 0 Either they overbook first class or they don't. (2) Y \\geq 0 Either theyoverbook tourist class or they don't. (3) Z \\geq 0 Either theyoverbook coach or they don't. (4) First class has one point for Reaction I, tourist class has one point for Reaction I, and coach has 5 points for Reaction I. Since the maximum tolerable limit is 15 points for Reaction I, we have the constraint X + Y + 5Z \\leq 15. (5) First class has 2 points for Reaction II, tourist class has three points for reaction II, and coach has one point for Reaction II.

Since the maximum tolerable limit is 9 points for ReactionIII, we have the constraint 2X + 2Y + Z \\leq 9. We cannot plot these constraints, for there are three unknown quantities and we would therefore require a three-dimensional graph. However, we know from a theorem of Linear Programming, that the point of maximum profit lies on the intersection of three constraints (the same number of constraints as the number of unknowns). Thus, to solve this problem we break up the six constraints into all the possible groups of three constraints. We then solve each group of three equations (taken from the three constraints) for the three unknowns. We now have a group of points. We take from that group of points those that meet the conditions set by all of the constraints. We then apply the profit formula to that set of points to obtain the point yielding the highest profit. The profit formula is: Profit = $10X + $12Y + $14Z.

The operating income is the net income derived from sales, purchasing and administrative activities, Expenses such as interest and taxes which do not directly contribute to a firm's sales are not accounted for in operating income. The income statement gives this income for the period 19X6 - 19X7 as $61,105. Take the total capital employed as being $411,700, i.e., the total assets. Usually we take the average of the total assets for the beginning of the production period 19X6 and at the end of the period 19X7. The reason is that $411,700 is not the amount of capital employed throughout 19X6 - 19X7. It is the capital at the end of the period. Nevertheless using $411,700 gives an idea how much capital was employed in 19X6 - 19X7. ratio = [{61,105} / {411,700}] = 0.148. This means that 1 dollar of capital gave 14.8 cents of net income before taxes and interest were deducted. 2. The net income is $27,875. The net worth (or owner's equity) is $150,000 + $68,705 = $218,705. ratio = [{27,875} / {218,705}] = 0.127. This ratio gives stockholders a measure of the return on their investment. For every dollar invested by the stock-holders, 12.7 cents was derived as net income. 3. As of December 31, 19X7 there were 25,000 shares of stock. The net income for the year, i.e., total earnings after taxes were 27,875. The earnings per share are [{27 ,875} / {25,000}] = 1.115 or 1 dollar and 11(1/2) cents per share. This may or may not be the amount declared as dividends. The net income can be divided in two parts. retained earnings and dividends to be paid to shareholders. 4. The inventory turnover is the rate at which the inventory is sold and needs to be replaced. The higher the rate, the faster the inventory is being sold. The average inventory held during the year is (95,380 (beginning) + 98,225 (ending) ) \\div2 = 96,802. 2 = 96,802. The total sales were 645,765. The inventory turnover is [{645,765} / {98,802}] = 6.67 times per year. The inventory turnover becomes useful when we compare it to that of other companies in the same industry. We may be able to relate it to the efficiency of a firm. 5. The turnover of accounts receivable is also a rate. It represents the number of times a year that collections are made on receivables. The balance sheet has the figure for the accounts receivable as of the end of 19X7. It would be preferable to also have the figure from the beginning of 19X7. We would then take the average of the two figures and use that to find the turnover. Since this is unavailable, we must make do with $71,750 as the average amount of accounts receivable held. Net sales were $645,765. This figure could also be seen as the total amount of accounts receivable acquired during the entire year; when a sale is made an account receivable is acquired. The turnover rate is: [{Total accounts receivable acquired} / {Average amount of accounts receivable held}] = [{$645,765} / {$71,750}] = 9 Receivable debts were collected 9 times during the year. 6. If receivables were collected 9 times during the year, the average length of each collection period is [{365 days} / {9}] = 40.5 days.

The capital recovery factor corresponding to this amount and the $10,000 investment is [(3,000) / (10,000)] = 0.3.

(b) Straight line depreciation on $10,000 over 5 years yields a [(10,000) / 5] =$2,000 annual charge. There is a tax deduction for this amount on net income, so the taxable income resulting from this investment is $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000. The tax rate is 60%, therefore the tax paid on this amount is ($1,000) (0.60) = $600. The net receipts after taxes and other disbursements are $7,000 - ($4,000 + $600) = $2,400.

The $240 saved is the receipt from owning the machine from years 6 through 25. To calculate the percentage return on investment, find the present worth (P.W.) factors that make the annual receipts equal to the original $10,000 investment. The interest rate corresponding to these factors is the percentage rate of return. The present worth will be: Annual Receipts for 1^st - 5^th years: ($1,440) (Uniform Annual Series Present Worth Factor for n = 5 years) + Annual Receipts for 6^th - 25^th years: ($240) (Uniform Annual Series P.W. factor for n= 20 years) (Single Payment P.W. factor for n = 5) The receipts of $240 for years 6 - 25 are multiplied by the single payment, n = 5 factor because these 20 receipts will not be earned until year 6; to only multiply them by the uniform series n = 20 will convert .them to their present worth in year 6.
