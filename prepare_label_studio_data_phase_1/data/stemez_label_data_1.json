Ideal Rankine cycle ratio: 0.160, Irreversible Rankine cycle ratio: 0.110, Carnot cycle ratio: 0.350\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\n(a) For the Rankine cycle, the heat added during the process of heating the water in the boiler is q_in = h_3 - h_2(1) where h_3 and h_2 are the enthalpies of the working fluid after and before the boiler respectively. From the steam tables h_3 = 1310.2 Btu/lbm h_2 = 181.1 Btu/lbm Substituting into Eq. (1) q_in = 1310.2 - 181.1 = 1129.1 Btu/lbm The net work for the cycle is given as w_net = \\sum_w = w_t + w_p(2) Consider the turbine w_t = h_3 - h_4(3) where h_3 and h_4 are the enthalpies before and after the turbine, respectively. From the steam tables h_4 = h_g = 1150.8 Btu/lbm(P = 15 psia) s_4 = s_g = 1.7550 Btu/lbm-\\textdegreeR Substituting into Eq.

Substitution into Eq. (2) w_net = 159.4 - 0.22 = 159.18 Btu/lbm Then [(w_net) / (q_in)] = [(159.18) / (1129.1)] = 0.141 (b) For the cycle with the increase in entropy, the heat added during the cycle is the same as in part (a), since the entropy increase happens during the expansion in the turbine.

At large Reynolds number the corresponding friction factors are 0.014 and 0.013 (from the Moody Chart). These are estimates, and a trial solution for the velocity in each pipe is made from these data. Then Reynolds numbers and more accurate friction factors are obtained iteratively. Using subscripts 1 and 2 for the smaller and larger pipes, respectively, (V_2 / V_1)= \\surd[(f_1 / f_2) (L_1 / L_2) (D_2 / D_1)] = \\surd[{(0.014) / (0.013)} {(1000) / (3000)} {(300) / (200)}] = 0.734 The pipe areas are 0.0314 and 0.0707 m^2. Then, from continuity, Q = V_1A_1 + V_2A_2 or 0.20 = 0.0314V_1 + (0.734V_1) (0.0707) and V_1 = 2.40 m/s and V_2 = 1.76 m/s.

This equation is V = 1. 318C (R_h)^0.63 S^0.54 ft/s Q = 1. 318C (R_h)^0.63 S^0.54 A ft^3/s where R_h= hydraulic radius of the pipe, A/P(R_h= D/4 for a round pipe), in feet; S = slope of the total head lineh_f/L; A = pipe cross-sectional area; C = roughness coefficient.

The roughness coefficient C is the same whether the equations in the technical English system or in the SI system are used. The different coefficients (1.318 and 0.850) indicate that the Hazen-Williams equations are not dimensionally consistent.

The Hazen-Williams equation is based on the premise that the Reynolds numbers are large and the pipes are reasonably rough so that the flow regime is in the range labeled complete turbulence, rough pipes in the figure. In this range the friction factors or roughness coefficients are independent of the Reynolds number. Flow in parallel pipe systems may readily be solved. SinceR_h= D/4 for a round pipe, we may write Eq. (3b) as Q = {(0.850\\piCD^2.63) / (4^1.63)} (h_L/ L)^0.54 Thus from Eq. (1) Q_0 = h_L^0.54 (C_1' + C_2' + C_3' + ... +C_n') where C' = {(0.850\\piCD^2.63) / (4^1.63L^0.54)} which has a fixed value for each pipe. Therefore, any assumed head loss h_Lthrough the parallel system will give flows in each pipe in the correct proportion, though the total may not be correct. The flow in each branch may be corrected by the same factor needed to correct the total flow to the given Q_0, and the head loss may be determined directly from Eq.(3a). C = 130 from the table. Assume a head loss ofh_L= 20 m.
