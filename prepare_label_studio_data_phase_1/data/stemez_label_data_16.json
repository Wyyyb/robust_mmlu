Look in the table named \"Capital Recovery Factors for Interest Rates from 0% to 25%\". The factor in the 8% column, five rows down is 0.25046, To recover $4,400 in 5 years, the company must recover ($4,400) (0.25046) = $1,102 per year for five years.

Option B At the end of one year, the company will receive $1,600 for this hand-operated machine, of which the present worth (what would be received today) is (0.9259) ($1,600) = $1,481. The multiplier, 0.9259, is the single-payment present worth factor obtained from the compound interest table for 8%, n = 1 year (period). The net capital disbursement is therefore $4,400 (price of the machine) - $1,481 (resale value) = $2,919. If we recover this amount in one year (n = 1), when 8% =i (interest), the capital recovery cost of the machine is (1.08) ($2,919) = $3,153. Operating costs are $2,600, so that under Option B, the cost of the manual machine is $2,600 + $3,153 = $5,753 the first year.

The net capital disbursement is therefore $4,400 (price of the machine) - $1,481 (resale value) = $2,919. If we recover this amount in one year (n = 1), when 8% =i (interest), the capital recovery cost of the machine is (1.08) ($2,919) = $3,153. Operating costs are $2,600, so that under Option B, the cost of the manual machine is $2,600 + $3,153 = $5,753 the first year. For the new machine, the annual capital recovery cost of $6,200 at 8% over 4 years is ($6,200) (0.30192) = $1,872. The factor 0.30192 is from the capital recovery factors table fori= 8%, n = 4 periods (years). Adding annual operating costs, we get annual costs for each of years two through five of $1,872 + $800 = $2,672. If the Dickenson Company chooses Option A, it will save $5,753 - $3,702 = $2,051 the first year. If the company chooses Option B, it will save $3,702 - $2,672 = $1,030 per year for years two through five, or $1,030 \u00d7 4 = $4,120.

He expects to sell the property in ten years. For the first 3 years, Johnson expects rent income from the property to be $7,000 and expenses to be $2,700. For the next 7 years, revenue will be $10,000 and expenses, $3,500. Johnson will deduct a 2% depreciation allowance on the building from his taxable incomes.

The percentage ratio of the profit (or loss) to investment is [(Present worth of income-investment) /(investment)]\u00d7 100%. For each of the first 3 years, net annual receipts will be: Gross Annual receipts - expenses = $7,000 - $2,700 = $4,300. Since the depreciation allowance on the building is tax de-ductible, i.e., it is not included in taxable income, Taxable Income = Net Annual Receipts - Depreciation Allowance = $4,300 - (2% \u00d7 $50,000) = $4,300 - $1,000 = $3,300. Since $3,300 falls within the first $4,000 limit, Income Taxes = 0.3344 \u00d7 $3,300 = $1,104, to the nearest dollar, And Net Income Net Annual Receipts - Income Taxes = $4,300 - $1,104 a $3,196. The depreciation allowance, since it is not an actual cash dis-bursement, is only deducted to find taxable income, but has no effect on actual net income. Present worth is how much an expected future receipt is worth today. Money invested today earns interest in the future, $100 invested today at 6%, will be worth $106 a year from today, the present worth of the $106 is $100. Consult the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table. Use the \"Uniform Annual Series \" section, since we are discussing 3 annual $3,196 payment, to find in the \"Present Worth Factor\" column, for n(number of years) = 3, the factor 2.624. The present worth factor for i (interest rate) = 7%, n = 3 can also be computed from the \"Capital Recovery Factors for Interest Rates from 0% to 25%\" table. The capital recovery factor is the reciprocal of the present worth factor in a uniform annual series. In this table there is no 7% column, but there is a 6% and an 8% column. Since 7% is halfway between 6% and 8%, its capital recovery is halfway between those of 6% and 8% for n = 3. The capital recovery (C.R.) factor of 7% is [(C.R. factor of 6% + C.R. factor of 8%) / 2] = [(0.37411 + 0.38803) / 2] = 0.38107. The present worth factor, the reciprocal, is [1 / (.38107)] = 2.624 , (to the nearest thousandth). This is the same result obtained from the 7% table. The present worth of 3 annual $3,196 payments is $3,169 \u00d7 2.624 = $8,386, to the nearest dollar. Over the next 7 years: Net Annual Receipts = Gross Annual Receipts - Expenses = $10,000 - $3,500 = $6,500 . Taxable Income = Net Annual Receipts - Depreciation Allowance = $6,500 - $1,000 = $5,500. The first $4,000 of taxable income will be taxed at 33.44% and the remaining $5,000 - $4,000 = $1,500 will be taxed at 37.84% Income Taxes = ($4,000 \u00d7 .3344) + ($1,500 \u00d7 .3784) = 1337.6 + 567.6 = 1905.2, or $1,905 to the nearest dollar. Net Income = Net Annual Receipts - Income Taxes = $6,500 - $1,905 = $4,595 . Since Johnson will not start receiving the annual $4,595 income until 3 years have passed, adjust the figure to what it would be if he were to begin receiving this income today; calculate its present value for n = 3, i = 7%. In the present worth column of the single payment section (since only the amount of one payment is being ad-justed) of the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table, for n = 3, find the factor 0.8163. By interpolating from the capital recovery factor table, find that the present worth factor of 7 annual receipts of $3,751 at 7% interest is approximately 5.3879. It is equal to [1 / {(1 / 2) (C.R. factor i = 6%, n = 7 + C.R. factor i = 8%, n = 7)}] = [1 / {(1 / 2) (.1794 + .19207)}] = [1 / (.1856)] = 5.3879. The present worth factor in the 7% compound interest table, for 7 annual payments, is 5.389. Use this latter factor. The present worth of 7 annual $3,751 payments, where the cur-rent interest rate is 7%, is $3,751 \u00d7 5.389 = $20,214, to the nearest dollar. In ten years, when the property is sold, there will be a long-term taxable gain of : Sales price less: purchase price plus: depreciation allowance {10 years \u00d7 ($1,000/year)} $61,500 (58,000) 10,000 $13,500 According to the tax rates given in the problem, the taxes on this gain will be ($2,500 \u00d7 .3784) + ($4,000 \u00d7 .4136) + ($4,000 \u00d7 .44) + ($3,000 \u00d7 .4664) = $946 + $1,654.4 + $1,760 + $1,399.2 = $5,760, to the nearest dollar. Multiply the second tax rate, 37.84% by $2,500 because it is part of the tenth year income which also includes $4,000 to be taxed at the 33.44% rate and $1,500 to be taxed at 37.84%. There is another $4,000 - $1,500 = $2,500 that can be taxed at 37.84%. The net receipts on the sale of the property = sales price - taxes on taxable gain = $61,500 - $5,760 = $55,740. The present worth factor for this single receipt of $55,740, found in the 7% Compound Interest Factors\" table in the present worth factors column of the single payment section, for n = 10, is 0.5803. The present worth of $55,740 received in 10 years, for i (interest rate) = 7% is $55,740 - 0,5083 = $28,333, to the nearest dollar. The present worth of the property for 10 years = present worth of rent + present worth of net receipts from sale = $8,386 (3 years rent) + $20,214 (7 years rent) + $28,333 (net receipts) = $56,933.

For each of the first 3 years, net annual receipts will be: Gross Annual receipts - expenses = $7,000 - $2,700 = $4,300. Since the depreciation allowance on the building is tax de-ductible, i.e., it is not included in taxable income, Taxable Income = Net Annual Receipts - Depreciation Allowance = $4,300 - (2% \u00d7 $50,000) = $4,300 - $1,000 = $3,300. Since $3,300 falls within the first $4,000 limit, Income Taxes = 0.3344 \u00d7 $3,300 = $1,104, to the nearest dollar, And Net Income Net Annual Receipts - Income Taxes = $4,300 - $1,104 a $3,196. The depreciation allowance, since it is not an actual cash dis-bursement, is only deducted to find taxable income, but has no effect on actual net income. Present worth is how much an expected future receipt is worth today. Money invested today earns interest in the future, $100 invested today at 6%, will be worth $106 a year from today, the present worth of the $106 is $100. Consult the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table. Use the \"Uniform Annual Series \" section, since we are discussing 3 annual $3,196 payment, to find in the \"Present Worth Factor\" column, for n(number of years) = 3, the factor 2.624. The present worth factor for i (interest rate) = 7%, n = 3 can also be computed from the \"Capital Recovery Factors for Interest Rates from 0% to 25%\" table. The capital recovery factor is the reciprocal of the present worth factor in a uniform annual series. In this table there is no 7% column, but there is a 6% and an 8% column. Since 7% is halfway between 6% and 8%, its capital recovery is halfway between those of 6% and 8% for n = 3. The capital recovery (C.R.) factor of 7% is [(C.R. factor of 6% + C.R. factor of 8%) / 2] = [(0.37411 + 0.38803) / 2] = 0.38107. The present worth factor, the reciprocal, is [1 / (.38107)] = 2.624 , (to the nearest thousandth). This is the same result obtained from the 7% table. The present worth of 3 annual $3,196 payments is $3,169 \u00d7 2.624 = $8,386, to the nearest dollar. Over the next 7 years: Net Annual Receipts = Gross Annual Receipts - Expenses = $10,000 - $3,500 = $6,500 . Taxable Income = Net Annual Receipts - Depreciation Allowance = $6,500 - $1,000 = $5,500. The first $4,000 of taxable income will be taxed at 33.44% and the remaining $5,000 - $4,000 = $1,500 will be taxed at 37.84% Income Taxes = ($4,000 \u00d7 .3344) + ($1,500 \u00d7 .3784) = 1337.6 + 567.6 = 1905.2, or $1,905 to the nearest dollar. Net Income = Net Annual Receipts - Income Taxes = $6,500 - $1,905 = $4,595 . Since Johnson will not start receiving the annual $4,595 income until 3 years have passed, adjust the figure to what it would be if he were to begin receiving this income today; calculate its present value for n = 3, i = 7%. In the present worth column of the single payment section (since only the amount of one payment is being ad-justed) of the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table, for n = 3, find the factor 0.8163. By interpolating from the capital recovery factor table, find that the present worth factor of 7 annual receipts of $3,751 at 7% interest is approximately 5.3879. It is equal to [1 / {(1 / 2) (C.R. factor i = 6%, n = 7 + C.R. factor i = 8%, n = 7)}] = [1 / {(1 / 2) (.1794 + .19207)}] = [1 / (.1856)] = 5.3879. The present worth factor in the 7% compound interest table, for 7 annual payments, is 5.389. Use this latter factor. The present worth of 7 annual $3,751 payments, where the cur-rent interest rate is 7%, is $3,751 \u00d7 5.389 = $20,214, to the nearest dollar. In ten years, when the property is sold, there will be a long-term taxable gain of : Sales price less: purchase price plus: depreciation allowance {10 years \u00d7 ($1,000/year)} $61,500 (58,000) 10,000 $13,500 According to the tax rates given in the problem, the taxes on this gain will be ($2,500 \u00d7 .3784) + ($4,000 \u00d7 .4136) + ($4,000 \u00d7 .44) + ($3,000 \u00d7 .4664) = $946 + $1,654.4 + $1,760 + $1,399.2 = $5,760, to the nearest dollar. Multiply the second tax rate, 37.84% by $2,500 because it is part of the tenth year income which also includes $4,000 to be taxed at the 33.44% rate and $1,500 to be taxed at 37.84%. There is another $4,000 - $1,500 = $2,500 that can be taxed at 37.84%. The net receipts on the sale of the property = sales price - taxes on taxable gain = $61,500 - $5,760 = $55,740. The present worth factor for this single receipt of $55,740, found in the 7% Compound Interest Factors\" table in the present worth factors column of the single payment section, for n = 10, is 0.5803. The present worth of $55,740 received in 10 years, for i (interest rate) = 7% is $55,740 - 0,5083 = $28,333, to the nearest dollar. The present worth of the property for 10 years = present worth of rent + present worth of net receipts from sale = $8,386 (3 years rent) + $20,214 (7 years rent) + $28,333 (net receipts) = $56,933. Johnson has incurred a 58,000 - 56,933 = $1,067 loss, which is [($1,067) / (58,000)] 100 = (to the nearest {1/100%}) 1.84% of his investment."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nWhat is the price of one page and 5 one-sixth page advertisements within one year?

Straight line depreciation at 2% means that the annual depreciation on the building is (0.02) ($55,000) = $1,100. Mr. Fields has held this property for 15 years and thus the accumulated depreciation is (15) ($1,100) = $16,500. The book value of the property is therefore $65,000 - $16,500 = $48,500.

When you pay back the money, you pay back the amount borrowed plus the interest. Interest is dependent on three things; the principal, the rate of interest, and the length of the time, or term, of the loan. The principal is the original amount that you borrow.

Taxes = $5,750 + 53% of ($30,000 - 25,000) = $5,750 + (.53) (5,000) = $8,400. Net income to be paid as dividends = $30,000 - $8,400 = $21,600 (b) Net Income per Stockholder. Dividends per stockholder: [(net income) / (number of stockholders)] = [(21,600) / 2] = $10,800 .

The total area of the circular sections of the cylinder is \\pir^2 + \\pir^2 = 2\\pir^2 square feet so that the cost of these sections is $2 (2\\pir^2) = $4\\pir^2. The units are correct since we have (dollars/sq.ft.) \u00d7 (sq.ft.) = dollars. The total area of the side section is 2\\pirh(the circumference of the cylinder times the height h of the cylinder). The cost of this section is $1.5(2\\pirh) = $3\\pirh . The total cost as a function oftwovariables is C(r, h) = 4\\pir^2 + 3\\pirh . If the volume of the container is to be 10 cubic feet, then the following relation must be true. Volume = \\pir^2 h = 10 since the left side of the equation is the volume of the cylinder with radius r and height h. We can get the cost as a function of one variable, say r by solving for h in the equation above and substituting into C(r, h). h = [(10) / (\\pir^2)] C(r,h) = 4\\pir^2 + 3\\pirh C(r) = 4\\pir^2 + 3\\pir [(10) / (\\pir^2)] = 4\\pir^2 + (30 / r). We can now proceed to minimize the cost. The first derivative of C(r) is C'(r) = 8\\pir - (30 / r^2). Set this equal to zero and solve for r. 8\\pir - (30 / r^2) = 0, [{8\\pir^3} / {r^2}] - (30 / r^2) = 0, [{8\\pir^3 - 30} / {r^2}] = 0, 8\\pir^3 - 30 = 0(multiply both sides by r^2) 8\\pir^3 = 30, r^3 = (30 / 8\\pi) or r = ^3\\surd(15 / 4\\pi) \\approx 1.061 feet and h = [(10) / (\\pir^2)] \\approx [{10} / {\\pi(1.061)^2}] \\approx 2.828 feet.

The after tax income is $4,650 - $1,860 = $2,790. The rate of return on a personal invest-ment of $50,000 is [(2,790) / (50,000)] \u00d7 100% = 5.58%. Find Rate of Return:Plan C. (1) The interest paid on $60,000 at an annual rate of 5(1/2)% is (0.055) ($60,000) = $3,300. Since the annual maintenance disburse-ments and the depreciation charge remain the same, the total annual expense is $3,300 + $3,200 + $1,250 = $7,750. Income before taxes is $10,450 - $7,750 = $2,700 the tax rate is 40% so the tax paid on this amount is (0.4) ($2,700) = $1,080 and the net income is $2,700 - $1,080 = $1,620. The rate of return on a $20,000 personal investment is [($1,620) / ($20,000)] \u00d7 100% = 8.1% [($1,620) / ($20,000)] \u00d7 100% = 8.1% Therefore, Mr. Haskell should choose Plan C; he should borrow $60,000 and use $20,000 of his money to get the greatest rate of return."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nMr. Glass borrowed $250 from the ABC Finance Company.

The investment should not be considered\nD. The fuel cost reduction is adequate\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\n(a) Find the capital recovery cost of the $8,000 investment at 7% over 10 years. The capital recovery factor fori(interest) = 7% and n = 10 years, 0.14238, is in the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table. An $8,000 investment over a 10 year period at 7% interest should then yield annually ($8,000) (0.14238) = $1,139.04 as a return to satisfy the investor. In the airline's case, its costs are reduced only by $1,000; the return on the investment is inadequate, the investment should not be made. (b) If the fuel cost for the first year is $1,000, and if it increases 5% each year, the fuel cost for the second year will be $1,000 + (.05) ($1,000) = $1,050. A simpler way to get the cost of $1,000 worth of fuel n years from now, knowing that there is a price increase of 5% annually, is to use the compound formula P_n-1 = P(1 +i)^n-1 , whereiis the rate of increase, n is the year (calling the second year 1), and P is the principle, $1,000. For the 2nd year, n = 1, we have P_1 = ($1,000) (1.05)^1 = $1,050. For the remaining years: P_2 = ($1,000) (1.05)^2 = ($1,000) (1.103) = $1,103 third P_3 = ($1,000) (1.05)^3 = ($1,000) (1.158) = 1,158 fourth P_4 = ($1,000) (1.05)^4 = ($1,000) (1.216) = 1,216 fifth P_5 = ($1,000) (1.05)^5 = ($1,000) (1.276) = 1.276 sixth P_6 = ($1,000) (1.05)^6 = ($1,000) (1.340) = 1,340 seventh P_7 = ($1,000) (1.05)^7 = ($1,000) (1.407) = 1,407 eighth P_8 = ($1,000) (1.05)^8 = ($1,000) (1.477) = 1,477 ninth P_9 = ($1,000) (1.05)^9 = ($1,000) (1.551) = 1,551 tenth You can find all the factors (1.05)^n in the 5% compound interest table, so you do not need a calculator.

The capital recovery factor fori(interest) = 7% and n = 10 years, 0.14238, is in the \"7% Compound Interest Factors\" table. An $8,000 investment over a 10 year period at 7% interest should then yield annually ($8,000) (0.14238) = $1,139.04 as a return to satisfy the investor. In the airline's case, its costs are reduced only by $1,000; the return on the investment is inadequate, the investment should not be made. (b) If the fuel cost for the first year is $1,000, and if it increases 5% each year, the fuel cost for the second year will be $1,000 + (.05) ($1,000) = $1,050. A simpler way to get the cost of $1,000 worth of fuel n years from now, knowing that there is a price increase of 5% annually, is to use the compound formula P_n-1 = P(1 +i)^n-1 , whereiis the rate of increase, n is the year (calling the second year 1), and P is the principle, $1,000. For the 2nd year, n = 1, we have P_1 = ($1,000) (1.05)^1 = $1,050.

We can calculate how much interest each of the three deposits will earn, and then add the three amounts to determine the total interest that the three monthly installments will receive. We can use the formula: Interest = Principal \u00d7 Rate of Interest \u00d7 Term (in years) to calculate each of the amounts of interest.
