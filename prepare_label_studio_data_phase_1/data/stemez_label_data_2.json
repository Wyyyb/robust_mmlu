For computation of the equivalent resistance at 75\\textdegree C, the direct-current component of the equivalent resistance must be determined. The ratio of transformation is 10, and from the direct-current resistances R_dcH + a^2R_dcX = 2.80 + 2.76 = 5.56 ohms at 25\\textdegree C. The equivalent resistance at 75\\textdegree C is given by R_eqH(75) = R_dcH(\\texttheta) \\bullet [(309.5) / (234.5 + \\texttheta)] + [R_eqH(\\texttheta) - R_dcH(\\texttheta)] [(234.5 + \\texttheta) / (309.5)] = 5.56 \u00d7 [(309.5) / (234.5 + 25)] + [6.07 - 5.56] \u00d7 [(234.5 + 25) / (309.5)] = 7.05 ohms.

Efficiency = 1 -[(Losses) / (Input)] = 1 - 0.0291 = 0.9709. Computing the voltage regulation requires that the equivalent reactance be found.

Equation (1) contains two suchconstants, as we should expect for a second-order differential equation. These constants can be determined only from the boundary conditions. Since the field varies only with x and is not a function of y and z, if x is a constant, then V is a constant, or in other words, theequipotential surfacesare described by setting x constant. These surfaces are parallel planesnormal to the x axis. The field is thus that of a parallel-plate capacitor, and as soon as the potential on any two planes is specified, the constantsof integration may be evaluated.

Laplace's equation reduces to [(\\partial^2V) / (\\partialx^2)] = 0 andthe partial derivative may be replaced by an ordinary derivative, since yand z are not involved, [(d^2V) / (dx^2)] = 0 Integrate twice, obtaining (dV/dx) = A and V = Ax + B(1) whereA and B are constants of integration. Equation (1) contains two suchconstants, as we should expect for a second-order differential equation. These constants can be determined only from the boundary conditions. Since the field varies only with x and is not a function of y and z, if x is a constant, then V is a constant, or in other words, theequipotential surfacesare described by setting x constant. These surfaces are parallel planesnormal to the x axis. The field is thus that of a parallel-plate capacitor, and as soon as the potential on any two planes is specified, the constantsof integration may be evaluated. To be very general, let V = V_1 at x = x_1 and V = V_2 at x = x_2. These values arethen substituted into (1), giving V_1= Ax_1 + BV_2= Ax_2 + B A= [(V_1 - V_2) / (x_1 - x_2)]B= [(V_2x_1 - V_1x_2) / (x_1 - x_2)] and V = [{V_1 (x - x_2) - V_2 (x - x_1)} / (x_1 - x_2)](2) A simpler answer would have been obtained by choosing simpler boundaryconditions. If V = 0 at x = 0 and V = V_0 at x = d, then A = (V_0 / d)B = 0 and V = [(V_0x) / d](3) Capacitance is given by the ratio of charge to potential difference, so choosenow the potential difference as V_0, which is equivalent to one boundarycondition, and then choose whatever second boundary condition seemsto help the form of the equation the most. This is the essence of thesecond set of boundary conditions which produced (3). The potential differencewas fixed as V_0 by.choosingthe potential of one plate zero and theother V_0; the location of these plates was made as simple as possible byletting V = 0 at x = 0. Using (3), then, the total charge on either plate is still needed before the capacitancecan be found. The necessary steps are these after the choice of boundary conditions hasbeen made: 1. Given V, useE= -\\nablaV to findE. 2. UseD=\\epsilonEto findD. 3. EvaluateDat either capacitor plate,D=D_s =D_na_n. 4. Recognize that\\rho_s= D_n. 5.

If I denotes the rms line current, the power lost in the differential length dz is I^2R dz, and the power delivered to the load R_r if I_r^2R_r, with I_r denoting the rms load current. In order to determine the efficiency of transmission it is needed to find the line losses in terms of the load current I_r. As V_r = I_rR_r, it follows from I = I_r cos \\beta(l - z) + j (V_r / Z_0) sin \\beta(l - z) that I^2 = l_r^2[cos^2 \\betay + (R_r / R_0)^2 sin^2 \\betay] with y denoting the distance from the receiving end. The line loss can be expressed as ^l\\int_0 I^2R dy. Substitution for I^2, with (R_r / R_0) replaced by (1/2), gives P_lost = I_r^2R ^100\\int_0 (cos^2 \\betay + 1/4 sin^2 \\betay) dy The constant R is 0.025, and the constant \\beta is \\omega\\surd(LC), or 0.0838. Making these substitutions and evaluating the integral, the power loss is found to be 1.51I_r^2. The power to the load is 300I_r^2. Therefore, the efficiency of transmission is {(P_load) / (P_load + P_loss)} = {(300I_r^2) / (300I_r^2 + 1.51I_r^2)} = 99.5%"}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nGiven thephasorsV_12^\\ding{217} = 6\\angle30\\textdegree, V_23^\\ding{217} = 2\\angle0\\textdegree, V_24^\\ding{217} = 6\\angle- 60\\textdegree, and V_15^\\ding{217} = 4\\angle90\\textdegree, find: (a) V_14^\\ding{217}; (b) V_43^\\ding{217}; (c) V_35^\\ding{217}.\n\nOptions:\nA.
