Thus the K capital required at present is K_t = 0.75 aYt+ t+ 1 + 0.25aY_t+2 = 0.75 \u00d7 3 \u00d7Y_t+_1 + 0.25 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 Y_t+2 = 2.25Y_t+_1 + 0.75 Y_t+2. The capital required at present is K_t = 2.25Y_t+_1 + 0.75 Y_t+2 and the capital available at present is the capital of the preceding period K_t-1 = 2.25Y_t+ 0.75 Y_t+1. The time-indices are simply shifted one period backward. The present capital gap is the difference between the capital required and the capital available. Thus K_t - K_t-1= (2.25Y_t+_1 + 0.75 Y_t+2) - (2.25Y_t+ 0.75 Y_t+1) = 0.75Y_t+_2 + 1.50 Y_t+1 - 2.25Y_t. Taking 0.75 before brackets shows the weights given to the outputs between the brackets: K_t - K_t-1 = 0.75 (Y_t+_2 + 2 Y_t+1 - 3Y_t). This is the present gap. To find the preceding gap, shift the time indices again one period backward . The preceding capital gap is then [K_t-1 - K_t-2] = [0.75 (Y_t+_1 + 2Y_t - 3Y_t-1)]. Investments pro-vide additional capital for 80% of the present gap and 10% of the preceding capital gap, as given. Thus the present investments are I_t = [0.80 (K_t - K_t-1) + 0.10 (K_t-1 K_t-2)]. Substituting the expressions above for both gaps results in the desired distributed-lag- accelerator expression: I_t = 0.80 [0.75 (Y_t+_2 + 2 Y_t+1 - 3Y_t)] +0.10 [0.75 (Y_t+1 + 2Y_t- 3 Y_t-1)] After substituting for the termsY_t+_2, Yt_+1,Y_t, Y_t-1, the distributed-lag- accelerator is obtained: I_t = 0.6Y_t+_2 + 1.275 Y_t+1 - 1.65Y_t- 1.80 Y_t-1 From this expression note that investments are based partly on expectation of GNP in the future, whereby the nearest future - Y_t+1 - is more influential than Y_t+2, two periods ahead; partly on present GNP,Y_t; and partly on past GNP, Y_t-1. In this economy GNP must progressively grow , other-wise the investments required become negative. For example, assume that GNP remains constant, i.e., Y_t-1 =Y_t= Y_t+1 = Y_t+2 = Y. ThusI_t = 0.6 Y + 1.275 Y - 1.65 Y - 1.80 Y = - 1.575 Y. In other words, in this unrealistically pessimistic economy there is a strong tendency for investments to fall, and head for a deep depression. Only if the behavior of the business changes, towards becoming less conservative , can this economy be \"saved.\" (The 'conservative' investment behavior can also be explained by capacity limitations of the capital goods producing industries; even if business wants to add quickly new capital, it is constrained to do so.

Thus K_t - K_t-1= (2.25Y_t+_1 + 0.75 Y_t+2) - (2.25Y_t+ 0.75 Y_t+1) = 0.75Y_t+_2 + 1.50 Y_t+1 - 2.25Y_t. Taking 0.75 before brackets shows the weights given to the outputs between the brackets: K_t - K_t-1 = 0.75 (Y_t+_2 + 2 Y_t+1 - 3Y_t). This is the present gap. To find the preceding gap, shift the time indices again one period backward . The preceding capital gap is then [K_t-1 - K_t-2] = [0.75 (Y_t+_1 + 2Y_t - 3Y_t-1)]. Investments pro-vide additional capital for 80% of the present gap and 10% of the preceding capital gap, as given. Thus the present investments are I_t = [0.80 (K_t - K_t-1) + 0.10 (K_t-1 K_t-2)]. Substituting the expressions above for both gaps results in the desired distributed-lag- accelerator expression: I_t = 0.80 [0.75 (Y_t+_2 + 2 Y_t+1 - 3Y_t)] +0.10 [0.75 (Y_t+1 + 2Y_t- 3 Y_t-1)] After substituting for the termsY_t+_2, Yt_+1,Y_t, Y_t-1, the distributed-lag- accelerator is obtained: I_t = 0.6Y_t+_2 + 1.275 Y_t+1 - 1.65Y_t- 1.80 Y_t-1 From this expression note that investments are based partly on expectation of GNP in the future, whereby the nearest future - Y_t+1 - is more influential than Y_t+2, two periods ahead; partly on present GNP,Y_t; and partly on past GNP, Y_t-1. In this economy GNP must progressively grow , other-wise the investments required become negative. For example, assume that GNP remains constant, i.e., Y_t-1 =Y_t= Y_t+1 = Y_t+2 = Y. ThusI_t = 0.6 Y + 1.275 Y - 1.65 Y - 1.80 Y = - 1.575 Y. In other words, in this unrealistically pessimistic economy there is a strong tendency for investments to fall, and head for a deep depression. Only if the behavior of the business changes, towards becoming less conservative , can this economy be \"saved.\" (The 'conservative' investment behavior can also be explained by capacity limitations of the capital goods producing industries; even if business wants to add quickly new capital, it is constrained to do so. There may be a serious backlog in the investment projects .)"}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nSuppose that real GNP doubles while the quantity of money increase by 80%.

The Unified Budget shows the cash flows of the U.S. Treasury. The trustaccounts, such as those of the Social Security Administration, are included. Also shown is the amount lent by the various federal credit agenciesfor hous-ing, agriculture, and international assistance. The net lending, equal to the excess of loan disbursements over loan repayments, hasbecome more important because of the expansion in the activities of thefederal credit agencies. The National Income Accounts Budget is based on the conception ofoutput used in the national income accounts.

The money supply reduces by $100,000,000 if the FED raises the required reserve ratio to 25% and increases by $500,000,000 if the FED lowers the reserve ratio to 10%.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nThe money supply (M_1) consists of demand deposits and cur-rency held by the public. Bank loans constitute a major source of bank deposits, since banks usually make loans by adding the amount of the loan to the account balance of the borrower. Thus, factors affecting the lending capacity of the bank will have an impact on bank deposits and hence on the money supply. The required reserve ratio is such a factor, since it determines each bank's required reserves and thereby also the amount of excess reserves it has available to lend. In our example, the banks' required reserves are initially ($500,000, 000) \u00d7 (20%) = $100,000,000, as are their actual reserves. Therefore, the banking system has no excess reserves (actual reserves - required reserves) and no capacity to make additional loans. If the FED raises the required reserve ratio to 25%, required re-serves are ($500,000,000) \u00d7 (25%) = $125,000,000. Actual reserves are still only $100,000,000, however. The banks must therefore act to re-duce their demand deposit liabilities and thereby also the amount of their required reserves, to the level at which required reserves are no more than actual reserves. They achieve the reduction in demand de-posits by calling in loans. The banks must continue to call in loans until their $100,000,000 in reserves are equal to at least 25% of their demand deposits, that is, until their total demand deposits are no more than 1/25% = 4 times their reserves. Total demand deposits of the banking system must be reduced to 4 \u00d7 $100,000,000 = $400,000,000 from $500,000,000, as a result of the increase in the required reserve ratio from 20% to 25%. It thus reduces the money supply by $100,000,000. An increase in the required reserve ratio represents \"contractionary\" monetary policy by the FED, If the FED lowered the required reserve ratio from 20% to 10%, the required reserves for the initial $500,000,000 of demand deposits in the banking system would be ($500,000,000 \u00d7 10%) = $50,000,000, Since actual reserves of the system are $100,000,000, the banking system has $100,000,000 - $50,000,000 = $50,000,000 in excess reserves (actual reserves - required reserves), with which it can create new loans (demand deposits). The amount of new deposits (loans) which the banking system as a whole can create from $50,000,000 in excess reserves is that amount of which $50,000,000 is 10%, i.e., it can create an additional ($50,000,000 \\div 10%) = $500,000,000 in deposits.

Required reserves are ($1,000,000,000 \u00d7 10%) = $100,000,000, just equal to the system's actual reserves.

Marginal Cost = \u2206 Total Cost / \u2206 Quantity.

Also, as Q goes from 4 to 5, MR = 20. Therefore, at the point Q = 4, assuming linearity, MR is halfway between 60 and 20, or MR = (60 + 20) / 2 = 40.

The rule that maximizes the amount of goods and services purchased.\nD. The utility-maximizing rule prescribes the allocation of money income in such a way that the last dollar spent on each product purchased yields the same amount of extra (marginal) utility.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nIn dealing with the behavior of the so-called \"rational\" consumer, economists assume that he attempts to dispose of his money income in such a way as to derive the greatest amount of satisfaction, or total utility, from it. The consumer's goal is assumed to be utility maximization. In making his choices of goods and services, the typical consumer has a limited number of dollars in his pocket and the products he wants have price tags on them. Therefore he will be able to pur-chase only a limited amount of goods. Since his purchases are limited by his budget, the consumer must decide which specific collection of goods and services will yield the greatest amount of satisfaction.To do this, the rational consumer uses the utility- maximizing rule which prescribes the allocation of money income in such a way that the last dollar spent on each product purchased yields the same amount of extra (marginal) utility. To help explain this rule, let us examine an illustration. Suppose Mr. X is trying to decide which combination of goods A and B he should buy with his limited budget of $10, Assume product A costs $1 and product B costs $2. The table provides utility data necessary for solving. Notice how diminishing marginal utility sets in. (1) (2) Product A: price = $1 (3) Product B: price = $2 Units of product (a) Marginal utility. utils (b) Marginal utility per dollar (Mu/price) (a) Marginal utility. utils (b) Marginal utility per dollar (Mu/price) First Second Third Fourth Fifth Sixth Seventh 10 8 7 6 5 4 3 10 8 7 6 5 4 3 24 20 18 16 12 6 4 12 10 9 8 6 3 2 In columns 2a and 3a, we see the marginal utility of products A and B \"measured\" inutils. We must also construct columns 2b and 3b where we have marginal utility (MU) per dollar = MU/price. The point is this: To make the amounts of extra utility derived from differently priced goods comparable, marginal utility must be put on a per-dollar- spent basis, as is done in columns 2b and 3b. Now that we have Mr. X's marginal utility data, it must be decided in what order he should allocate his dollars on units of A and B to achieve the highest degree of utility. Concentrating on columns 2b and 3b, we see that Mr. X should first purchase one unit of B since it yields the greatest utility. This costs $2 and leaves $8 to spend. Next Mr. X is indifferent about buying A or B since they both yield tenutils. Suppose he buys both of them: Mr. X now has 1 unit of A and 2 units of B and $5 left. Note that with this Combination of goods, the last dol-lar spent on each yields the same amount of extra utility. But Mr. X keeps going since he has $5 more. Since the third unit of B yields 9utils, Mr. X will choose that, leaving him with $3. Then finally, Mr. X will purchase one more unit of A and B each since the second unit of A and the fourth unit of B each yield 8utils. This leaves Mr. X without any money. So, to max-imize utility, Mr. X will purchase four units of B and two units of A with total utility equaling 10 + 8 + 24 + 20 + 18 + 16 = 96utils. If the reader examines some of the other possible combinations of A and B, it will become apparent that A = 2 and B = 4 is the optimal com-bination. Looking at columns 2a and 3a, we see that trading of the fourth unit of B for the third and fourth unit of A would be giving up 16utilsfor 7 + 6 = 13utilsin return. Alternatively, giving up the original two units of A for a fifth unit of B would give up 18utilsfor 12utilsin return. Once again, a loss in total utility would take place.

Decreases the number of financial intermediaries\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe expansion of financial intermediaries affects: The money velocity is the ratio of income received to the money supply held; it represents the number of times money circulates. An increase in the number of financial intermediaries, in particular mutual savings banks and loan associations, increases the savings deposits, and there is less need to hold money relative to income. Thus the ratio [(income)/(money)] = Y/M = V, the velocity of money increases. This loosens the effect of the FED's control over the economic out' put, because spending Y = P \u00d7 Q depends both on the velocity V and the quantity of money M : Y = P \u00d7 Q = M \u00d7 V. The Fed controls M, but V is largely autonomous; so when V fluctu-ates erratically, the direct link between the money supply M and total spending Y is broken. Also wide variations in the annual growth of total credit provided by the finan-cial intermediaries causes wide variations in consumer and investment spending, thereby destabilizing the level of economic activity. When the amount of credit provided is not only influenced by the interest rates, but also by the amount of financial intermediation provided, this is again a cause of concern for the FED which loosens its control over total spending in the economy. And the sometimes lack of stability of the thrift institutions is a third reason for concern for the FED. Accelerated inflation is the funda-mental cause for this lack of stability. The assets of financial intermediaries are long-term, while their deposits are very short-term. A sharp increase in the interest rates caused by accelerated inflation causes troubles, because the rates earned on the long-term assets cannot be changed so quickly. The income on the long-term assets, for example mortgages, is fixed. Therefore the intermediaries are unable to raise the rates they pay on their deposits, and they can't compete with the other, higher paying, forms of saving. So they risk customers withdrawing their deposits to place them in the more conventional savings institution.

This is also the amount of its actual reserves. Thus, this bank is fully \"loaned up,\" i.e., it has no excess reserves. Actual reserves - Required re-serves = Excess reserves = 0. When a depositor withdraws $ 10,000 from the bank, its actual reserves are reduced by $ 10,000, to $ 52,500, and its deposit liabilities are also reduced by $ 10,000, to $ 240,000. The required reserves for $ 240,000 in deposit liabilities are (r \u00d7 Deposits) (0.25) \u00d7 ($240,000) = $ 60,000. Excess reserves (= Actual Reserves - Required reserves) have gone from zero to ( $52,500 - $ 60,000 ) = - $ 7,500. Alternatively, we could compute the change in excess re-serves as the difference between the change in actual re-serves and the change in required reserves. The change in actual reserves is the same as the amount of the change in de-posits, i.e., - $10,000. The bank has $ 10,000 less in vault cash as a result of the withdrawal. Required reserves, how-ever, do not change by the full $ 10,000. For, since the amount of reserves the bank is required to keep is only a cer-tain fraction of its deposits ( 25% in our example ), a change in its deposit liabilities via a deposit or withdrawal will change the amount of its required reserve by only that same fraction of the change in deposits. In our example, the change in required reserves = (required reserve ratio) \u00d7 (change in deposits) = ( 0.25 ) \u00d7 ( - $ 10,000 ) = - $ 2,500. Thus, the change in Excess reserves due to the $ 10,000 with-drawal is equal to the change in Actual reserves less the change in Required reserves = (Change in Deposits) - (re-quired reserve ratio) \u00d7 (Change in Deposits) = ( 1 - r ) (Change in Deposits )= (1 - 0.25) (-$ 10,000 ) = ( 0.75 ) ( - $ 10,000 ) =- $ 7,500. Since Actual reserves and re-quired reserves were equal before the withdrawal, and thus excess reserves were 0 (zero) , the amount of the change in ex-cess reserves is equal to the amount of excess reserves in the new situation. The bank's actual reserves are now below the amount re-quired by $ 7,500. In order to restore them to the required level, the bank must sell $ 7,500 worth of securities or call in $ 7,500 of its loans. If the bank's debtors withdraw this $ 7,500 from their banks, in order to repay their loans, their banks, too, if they had been fully \"loaned up\" (no ex-cess reserves), will be short of required reserves, by ( 1 - r ) (Change in Deposits) - ( 1 - 0.25 ) ( - $ 7,500 ) = - $ 5,625, and have to call in that amount of their loans to restore their reserves to the required level. If this process of withdrawals requiring contractions of bank loans necessi-tating further deposit withdrawals, etc., runs its full course, total demand deposits in the banking system will be reduced by the sum of the reductions at each successive stage. If we let \u2206H_1 represent the initial change in deposits ( - $ 10,000, in our example ), then as we saw the second stage reduction caused by the initial change, \u2206H_2 = (1 - r) (\u2206H_1) . The third stage reduction, \u2206H_3 = (1 - r)( \u2206H_2) = (1 - r) (1 - r)( \u2206H_1) = (1 - r)^2 2 (\u2206H_1); the fourth stage reduction, \u2206H_4 = (1 - r) (\u2206H_3) = (1 - r) (1 - r) (1 - r) (\u2206H_2) = (1 - r)^3 (\u2206H_1); and so on. The sum of the changes in deposits at each stage is thus given by: \u2206H_total = \u2206H_1 + (1 - r) \u2206H_1 + (1 - r)^2 (\u2206H_1) + (1 - r)^3 \u2206H_1 . . .

Thus, the initial $10,000 withdrawal can result in a cumulative contraction of (- $ 10,000 / 0.25) = 40,000 in the, amount of demand deposits in the economy if all banks are \"loaned up\" and all loans are repaid by withdrawals from demand deposits. The effect on the total money supply is the sum of this effect plus the effect on currency hold-ings of the public, which have risen by the $10,000 of the withdrawal. Thus the net effect of the $10,000 with-drawal on the money supply (demand deposits plus currency held by the public) is (- $40,000) + ($10,000) = - $30,000, ie., a reduction of the money supply by $30,000.", "ref_id": 2477, "meta_info": {"subject": "economics.csv", "src": "stemez-Economics", "question": "Suppose a bank has $ 250,000 in deposits and reserves of $ 62,500.

Then the full employment deficit must be calculated and compared with the current budget deficit. National income equals the total of expendi-tures, consumption, planned investments, government ex-penditures, and the trade surplus. (The trade surplus equals exports-imports.) Thus: Y = C + I + G + (Ex - Im) Consumption can be described by the relationship wherein households consume 90% of their disposable income; the rest--10%--is saved. Thus C = 0.90 (Y - T), where Y - T is disposable income. Taxes are proportional to income: T = 0.25Y. Substituting this in the income relationship results in C = 0.90 (Y - 0.25Y) = 0.90 \u00d7 0.75Y = 0.675Y Substituting this new figure into the income identity yields Y = 0.675Y + I + G + (Ex - Im) Next, bring the elements with the common term Y to the left side of the equation: 0.325Y = I + G + (Ex - Im) Dividing by 0.325 yields y = [1 / (0.325)] \u00d7 [I + G + (Ex - Im)] The multiplier is thus equal to [1 / (0.325)] = 3.077.

Consequently the buyers of these securities tend to allot more of their current income to consumption spending than they would if their savings were tied up in relatively non-liquid real estate or private business investments --in stocks, obligations, consumer durables, etc. And such an increase in consumption spending, adding to the aggregate demand, can have an inflationary pull. A second reason for the inflationary influence of the public debt is also connected with the liquidity of the se-curities. The huge amount of securities in the hands of households, securities that can easily be converted into cash, represents a backlog in buying power that may be con-verted at inconvenient times.

These government securities are very liquid assets; they can easily be converted into money. Consequently the buyers of these securities tend to allot more of their current income to consumption spending than they would if their savings were tied up in relatively non-liquid real estate or private business investments --in stocks, obligations, consumer durables, etc. And such an increase in consumption spending, adding to the aggregate demand, can have an inflationary pull. A second reason for the inflationary influence of the public debt is also connected with the liquidity of the se-curities. The huge amount of securities in the hands of households, securities that can easily be converted into cash, represents a backlog in buying power that may be con-verted at inconvenient times.

Instead Firm X must choose an advertising strategy, aware of the fact that Firm Y will be choosing a packaging strategy that will affect the impact of that advertising strategy. For example suppose Firm X chooses A_1. This part of the market share picture is shown below: P1 P2 P3 P4 A1 48 93 16 22 Firm Y now has to choose a packaging strategy. Since Y wants to maximize its own market share, it will seek to minimize X's market, share on the section of the matrix shown above. Thus Firm Y would select packaging strategy P_3 and Finn X's market share would be 16%. Similarly if Firm X chose A_2, Firm Y would retaliate with P_2 thus granting X a market share of 3%. If Firm X chose A_3, Firm Y would respond with P_3 giving Firm X a market share of 6%. Since Firm X knows that Firm Y will respond in the manner described above (this being an oligopoly), we would expect Firm X to select strategy A_1 which would give it maximum market share of 16%. Now consider the situation for Firm Y. To ease the analysis, it is useful to create a market share matrix for Firm Y, realizing that Market Share (x) + Market Share (Y) = 100%, or Market Share (Y) = 100 - Market Share (X), as in Table 2. Table 2:Market Share (%) for firm Y, Firm X' s choices P1 P2 P3 P4 Firm Y' s choices A1 52 7 84 78 A2 70 97 93 1 A3 40 63 94 67 Now we once again consider each strategy alternative, this time for Firm Y. Suppose Firm Y picks P_1. Firm X must respond and has chosen as shown in Table 3 (extracted from the preceding matrix.) Table 3: P1 A1 52 A2 70 A3 40 Firm X, in its attempt to maximize its own market share, will try to minimize Firm Y's market share. There-fore it would pick A_3 giving Firm Y a market share of 40%. Similarly, if Y picks P_2, X will respond with A_1, giving Y a market share of 7%. If Y picks P_3, X will pick A_1, giving Y a market share of 84%. Finally, if Y picks P_4, X will respond with A_2, giving Y a market share of A_2. In its attempt to maximize its own market share, Y will then pick P_3, since it knows X will respond to what-ever strategy it picks. At this point Y's market share will be 84%. So we see that the two firms in analyzing strategy and counter-strategy, have agreed upon a cell in the table. The A_1P_3 cell is Firm X's best choice, given Firm Y's reac-tion; it is also Firm Y's best choice, given Firm X's reaction. Thus, both rivals have selected a strategy, and it will yield 16% of the market to Firm X and 84% of the market to Firm Y.", "ref_id": 2552, "meta_info": {"subject": "economics.csv", "src": "stemez-Economics", "question": "Firms X and Y represent a duopoly in which the two rivals are fighting for the largest share of the market.

The increasing population results in a surplus of land.\nD. The fixed supply of land leads to a decrease in demand.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nWith the population constantly increasing, the demand for food, and hence the demand for land, would in-crease. Since the supply of land is fixed, the increased demand for land would result in a higher price for land. The price of the services of land is its rent. So the re-sult of the increasing number of mouths to feed, with a fixed supply of land, is that rents increase. The landlords are made richer without lifting a finger. Unlike capitalists, landlords cannot increase their future incomes by investing a part of their present incomes to increase the supply of their resource, since it is fixed. Hence, landlords tend to consume their incomes, contributing nothing to the accumulation of wealth. The crucial question for Ricardo is where this extra income of the landlords comes from. It cannot come out of the wages of workers which Ricardo assumed to be determined by the needs of subsistence. Rising food prices would force the workers to demand raises in the wage rate and since capitalists were not prepared to see their workforce die off, they would have to grant the pay raises. These pay raises would have to be taken out of profits, for if producers raised the prices of products the workers' real incomes would again be reduced below subsistence levels. This is the crucial point for Ricardo. The increasing population leads to an increased demand for land. This, in turn, eventually leads to a decline in profits. Moreover, since the population is constantly increasing, the rate of profit would be steadily declining. Eventually profits would be zero and hence there would exist no incentive for further investment. Capital accumulation would cease. The (mar-ginal) productivity of workers and output per capita would fall. There would then be economic stagnation, and decline. In summary, the eventual consequences of the popula-tion increase is a redistribution of income from capitalists to landlords.

These measurements would be measured in utils rather than objective units (like money). The neoclassical economists used this concept to illustrate the principle of diminishing marginal utility. With cardinal utility, an increase in the quantity of a good consumed would lead to a measurable decrease in the utility received from the last, or marginal , unit. Most economists today find simple preferences (ordinal utility), a more satisfactory tool of analysis than cardinal utility."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nGovernment has set the price at $3.00 a pie and the quantity demanded is assumed to be constant at 1,000,000 pies per year. There are five companies in the market, each selling exactly 20% of the total quantity. The five companies' products are identical and cost each company $2.00 each to produce. Early this year, company A added a secret ingredient its product which costs $0.30 for each pie. As a result, Company A's share of total pizza sales increased to 40%, at the expense of the four other companies whose market share dropped to 15% apiece. With the industry in an uproar over the shift away from equal shares of the market, Company A's president offered to tell what the secret ingredient was if each company would pay him $35,000, reasoning that each other company could double its sales, just as Company A had, and would therefore be more than willing to pay the $35,000.

To show this we must investigate what would happen if the other companies accepted Company A's proposal. When A introduced the secret ingredient into its pizza, there no longer was a market of uniform products and consumers began to prefer pizza A. But A's doubling of sales came completely at the expense of the four other companies due to the fact that the quantity demanded is constant at 1,000,000 pies per year. Therefore if Company A sold the secret, the market share of the four other companies would rise but only to the point where market share for each firm was once again 20%, since we would have now another undifferentiated product market. Company A's market share would therefore have to drop from 40% to 20%. The lesson is clear. If demand is constant, gains in total sales can only be had at the expense of com-petitors.

By buying the information, the five companies would once again achieve perfect competition. But profit per unit would be $0.70 as opposed to the profit per unit of $1.00 which existed before Company A introduced its secret ingredient. It would be to the advantage of the four firms in the industry to pay Company A the $35,000 each which A requested, but not to buy the rights to the secret information.

(1) Since all $7 must be spent and both A and B cost $1, we know that the number of units of A(x) times the price of A($1) plus the number of units of B(y) times the price of B($1) must equal $7. Stated algebraically, we have (x)($1) + (y)($1) = $7 or x + y = 7. (2) Here, we must equate MU_A /Price_Aand MU_B /Prlce_B. But since Price_A =Price_B= $1, the equation reduces to MU_A - MU_B, or 10 - x =21 - 2y. Now we have a system of two equations in two unknowns: x + y = 7 10 - x = 21 - 2y Since x + y = 7, we can add (-y) to both sides, getting x = 7 - y. Substituting this in the second equation above, we get 10 - x = 21 - 2y 10 - (7 - y) = 21 - 2y Eliminating the parenthesis, 10 - 7 + y = 21 - 2y 3 + y = 21 - 2y Adding 2y to both sides 3 + 3y = 21 Subtracting 3 from both sides 3y = 18 y = 6 Since x = 7 - y, x = 7 - 6 = 1. So, according to the formulae above, utility maximization occurs when one unit of product A and six units of product B are produced."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nIf the price of a pound falls from $2.10 to $2.00, is that depreciationor devaluation?

Symbol-ically, Budget deficit= G - T = B + M, whereG = government expenditures, T = taxes, B = borrowing, and M = newly created money. The borrowing (B) by the government adds to the national debt.

The second way to finance the government deficit is by creating money, either in the form of demand deposits or in the form of papernotes('banknotes'). In this case the Treasury sells the securities, butthese are immediately purchased by the Federal Reserve banks in theopen market.
