We also use the theorem that states that if f(t) is defined for all nonnegative t, is piecewise continuous on every closed interval [0, b] for b > 0, and is of exponential order e^\\alphat, then L{t^nf(t)} = (- 1)^n [(d^n) / (ds^n)]L{f(t)},(2) for s > \\alpha, where n is a positive integer. Using formula (1), we find that L{e^4t} = [1 / (s - 4)],for s > 4. In order to use the theorem associated with formula (2), we must first demonstrate that the function f(t) = e^4t is of exponential order; i.e., there exists a real constant \\alpha and positive real constants M and t_0 such that e^-\\alphat \\vertf(t)\\vert < M for all t > t_0. For \\alpha = 4, lim_t\\rightarrow\\infty e^-\\alphat \\verte^4t\\vert = lim_t\\rightarrow\\infty e^(4-\\alpha)t = 1.

Since f(t) = e^4t is defined for all nonnegative t, is piecewise continuous on every closed interval [0, b] for b > 0, and is of exponential order e^\\alphat for \\alpha \\geq 4, we can substitute formula (1) for L{f(t)} in formula (2): L{g(t)} = L{te^4t} = (- 1)(d / ds) L{e^4t} = - (d / ds) [1 / (s - 4)] = [1 / (s - 4)^2], for s > 4. (b) Using the property that L{t^nf(t)} = (- 1)^n (d^n / ds^n)L{f(t)}, where n is a positive integer constant, provided that L{f(t)} exists, we obtain L{t^7/2} = L{t^3 \\surdt} = (- 1)^3 (d^3 / ds^3)L{\\surdt} = - (d^3 / ds^3)L{\\surdt}(3) Now L{\\surdt} may be found using the \\Gamma function whose values are as well tabulated as, say, log x so that an answer expressible in terms of \\Gamma(x) is very useful.

Therefore, in practice, the quarter-wave transformer is used to connect resistive loads to resistive output impedances.

C_1, C_2 = constants C_p = specific heat of fluid D = diameter of pipe = 2R f(x), f'(x) = functions of x G(r) = function of r k = thermal conductivity of fluid q_w = constant rate of heat transfer per unit area from the pipe to the fluid r = radial coordinate R = radius of pipe T = temperature T_b(x) = local bulk mean temperature T_(b)1 = bulk mean temperature at x = 0 T_w = wall temperature u = fluid velocity U_m = maximum fluid velocity x = axial coordinate \\alpha = thermal diffusivity \\rho = density of fluid The partial differential equation which describes the temperature distribution for radial symmetry is (1/r)(\\partial / \\partialr)[r(\\partialT / \\partialr)] + [(\\partial^2T) / (\\partialx^2)] = (U/\\alpha)[(\\partialT) / (\\partialx)](1) Because axial conduction is neglected, [(\\partial^2T) / (\\partialx^2)] = 0, and equation (1) simplifies to (1/r) (\\partial / \\partialr)[r(\\partialT / \\partialr)] = (U/\\alpha)[(\\partialT) / (\\partialx)](2) This differential equation has the following boundary conditions : (1) Due to radial symmetry, at r = 0 for all x, (\\partialT / \\partialr) = 0. (2) The heat flux from the wall is a known constant. At r = R for all x, (\\partialT / \\partialr)_R = (q_w / k). (3) At x = 0, T_b = T_(b)1. A fully developed temperature profile is described by (\\partialT / \\partialx) = [(2q_w) / (\\rhoC_pU_mR)] = C_1(3) where (\\partialT / \\partialx) is a constant, C_1, whose value is known. The velocity profile u = u(r, x) is needed to solve equation (2). For this situation, the velocity profile is u = 2U_m = {1 - (r^2 / R^2)}(4) Substitution of equations (3) and (4) into equation (2) gives (1/r)(\\partial / \\partialr)[r(\\partialT / \\partialr)] = {(2U_mC_1) / \\alpha} [1 - (r^2 / R^2)] Partial integration with respect to r yields r(\\partialT / \\partialr) = {(2U_mC_1) / \\alpha} [(r^2 / 2) - (r^4 / 4R^2)] + f(x). Application of the first boundary condition forces f(x) = 0. Therefore (\\partialT / \\partialr) = {(2U_mC_1) / \\alpha}[(r/2) - (r^3 / 4R^2)](5) Equation (5) must fulfill the second boundary condition. Then (\\partialT / \\partialr)\\vert_R = {(U_mC_1R) / (2\\alpha)} Substituting for C_1 from equation (3) and using \\alpha = {k / (\\rhoC_p)}, equation (5), evaluated at r = R, is (\\partialT / \\partialr)\\vert_R = [{RU_m[(2q_w) / (\\rhoC_pU_mR)]} / {2k / (\\rhoC_p)}] = (q_w / k) Integrating equation (5) with respect to r again T = {(2U_mC_1) / \\alpha} [(r^2 / 4) - (r^4 / 16R^2)] + f'(x).(6) Integration of equation (3) with respect to x will allow the form of f'(x) to be obtained. The result is T = C_1x + G(r)(7) Because equations (6) and (7) describe the same temperature distribution, G(r) must equal the function of r in equation (6) within a constant, while C_1x must equal f'(x) within a constant. Therefore equation (6) can be rewritten as T = {(2U_mC_1) / \\alpha} [(r^2 / 4) - (r^4 / 16R^2)] + C_1x + C_2(8) C_2 is a constant which can be obtained from the third boundary condition.
