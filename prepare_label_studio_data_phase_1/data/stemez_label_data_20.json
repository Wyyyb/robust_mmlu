One faraday, be definition, deposits one gram-equivalent of material. The equivalent weight of a substance is that amount of the substance which 1 mole of electrons (1 faraday) can oxidize or reduce to a neutral species. You are told that 1.273g of Ag are deposited. From this, you can compute the number of faradays. The oxidation state of Ag is +1. Thus, the reaction that deposited Ag had to be (Ag^+) + (e^-)\\rightarrow Ag .

The heat absorbed when 1 g of solid melts is called the heat of fusion. The heat of fusion for water is 80 cal/g. In calculating the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of the liquid water, the specific heat must be used. The specific heat is de-fined as the number of calories of heat necessary to raise the temperature of a gram of a substance 1\\textdegreeC. The specific heat of water is 1\\textdegree, thus 1 calorie is needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1\\textdegreeC.

Heat is absorbed in each of these steps, so that each must be accounted for. Melting the ice: Because the heat of fusion is 80 cal/g for water, one knows that for every gram of ice melted, 80 cal of heat must be absorbed. Here, there are 10 grams of ice be-ing melted, so the specific heat must be multiplied by 10 to find the amount of heat absorbed. 10 g \u00d7 80 cal/g = 800 cal.

Vaporization: To find the amount of heat absorbed when the water is vaporized, the heat of vaporization must be used. For water, the heat of vaporization is 540 cal/g, which means that for every gram of water vaporized, 540 calories are absorbed. Here, 10 g of water is vaporized so that the heat of vaporization must be multiplied by 10 g to find the amount of heat absorbed. 10 g \u00d7 540 cal/g = 5400 cal.

Since Pressure = (Force / Area) and Force = mass \u00d7 gravity Combining these two equations one obtains Pressure = (mass \u00d7 gravity) / Area Since one is solving for mass the equation can be rearranged to mass = (Pressure \u00d7 Area) / gravity One is given the atmospheric pressure and the force of gravity. The surface area of a sphere is equal to 4\\pir^2. Substituting and solving for the mass of the homosphere: (N = kg - m/s^2) mass = (1.013 \u00d7 10^5 kg-m/m^2s^2) (4\\pi) (6.37 \u00d7 10^6 m)^2 / (9.8 m/sec^2) = 5.27 \u00d7 10^18 kg."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nGiven that \u2206H\\textdegree_CO2(g) = \\rule{1em}{1pt} 94.0, \u2206H\\textdegree_CO(g) = \\rule{1em}{1pt} 26,4, \u2206H\\textdegree_H2O(l) = 68.4 and \u2206H\\textdegree_H2O(g) = -57.8 Kcal/mole, determine the heats of reaction of (1) CO(g) + (1/2)O_2 (g) \\rightarrow CO_2 (g), (2) H_2(g) + (1/2) O_2 (g) \\rightarrow H_2O(l) and (3) H_2O(l) \\rightarrow H_2O(g).\n\nOptions:\nA. -67.6 Kcal/mole, -68.4 Kcal/mole, +10.6 Kcal/mole\nB. -67.6 Kcal/mole, +10.6 Kcal/mole, -68.4 Kcal/mole\nC.             -68.4 Kcal/mole, -67.6 Kcal/mole, +10.6 Kcal/mole\nD. +10.6 Kcal/mole, -68.4 Kcal/mole, -67.6 Kcal/mole\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nTo solve this problem, you need to know what heat of reaction means and how to determine it quantitati-vely.

This expression equates K, the equi-librium constant, to the concentration ratio of products to reactants, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the chemical equation. Thus, for this reaction, you can say K = {[H_2 O] [CO] } /{[H_2 ] [CO_2 ]} = 1.60. Initially, there was 1 mole of each component in the 20 liter container. Since, concentration = moles/liter, all had an initial concentration of (1mole) / (20 liter) = .05 M . At equilibrium, let x = the number of moles/liter of H_2 that have re-acted. Thus, its concentration, at equilibrium, becomes .05 - x. If x moles/liter of H_2 react, the same number of moles/liter of C0_2 must react also, since they react inequimolaramounts; this is seen from the chemical reaction. Thus, [CO_2] = .05 - x, at equilibrium. These x moles/liter have been converted to products. Thus, [H_2 O] = [CO] = .05 + x, at equilibrium. The two products have the same concentration, since, again, the reaction shows they are formed inequimolaramounts. As such, you can substitute these values to obtain {(.05 + x)(.05 + x)} / {(.05 - x)(.05 - x) } = 1.60 or (.05 + x) / (.05 - x) = \\surd(1.60) . Solving for x, you obtain x = .00585. Thus, the concentrations become [H_2 ] = [CO_2 ] = .0442 and [H_2 O] = [CO ] = .0558. If more H_2 is injected, the equilibrium is subjected to a stress, one component's concentration has been increased, and according to LeChatelier'sprinciple, the system will act to relieve the stress by shifting the equilibrium.

If x moles/liter of H_2 react, the same number of moles/liter of C0_2 must react also, since they react inequimolaramounts; this is seen from the chemical reaction. Thus, [CO_2] = .05 - x, at equilibrium. These x moles/liter have been converted to products. Thus, [H_2 O] = [CO] = .05 + x, at equilibrium. The two products have the same concentration, since, again, the reaction shows they are formed inequimolaramounts. As such, you can substitute these values to obtain {(.05 + x)(.05 + x)} / {(.05 - x)(.05 - x) } = 1.60 or (.05 + x) / (.05 - x) = \\surd(1.60) . Solving for x, you obtain x = .00585. Thus, the concentrations become [H_2 ] = [CO_2 ] = .0442 and [H_2 O] = [CO ] = .0558. If more H_2 is injected, the equilibrium is subjected to a stress, one component's concentration has been increased, and according to LeChatelier'sprinciple, the system will act to relieve the stress by shifting the equilibrium. To do this, more H_2 reacts with CO_2 , thus, decreasing their concentrations, to produce more H_2 O and CO, thereby, increasing their concentrations."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA piece of iron weighing 20.0 g at a temperature of 95.0\\textdegreeC was placed in 100.0 g of water at 25.0\\textdegreeC.

In a nonbuffered solution, the pH will change drastically. If a strong acid is added to a buffered solution, it reacts with the base A^- to produce a weak acid.

The acid-base ratio is altered somewhat but not to any great extent, thus allowing the pH to stay relatively stable. However, if the number of moles of acid or base added is greater than the number of moles of base or acid present, then the pH will change, thereby destroying the buffer. It is given that 0.1 M HCl is added. Since HCl is a strong acid, and dissociates completely, the H_3O^+ and Cl^- formed each have an initial concentration of 0.1 M. How-ever, the H_3O^+ will react with the CH_3COO^- and drive the equilibrium to the left by Le Chatelier's principle and produce a weak acid. Therefore, the buffer has converted the acid ions so that they cannot change the pH. Le Chatelier's principle states that when a stress is brought to bear on a system at equilibrium, the system tends to change so as to relieve the stress. The stress is relieved by driving the reaction to the other side of the equilibrium sign to prevent excesses of ions from building up. The net effect can be seen below.

This means that the heat absorbed by the ice must equal the heat lost by the water at 60\\textdegreeC. The heat absorbed by the ice is the combination of the heat absorbed by the ice in melting and the heat absorbed by the cold water to the new temperature. The heat absorbed when the ice melts can be calculated by taking into account the heat of fusion. The heat of fusion is defined as the number of calories absorbed when 1 g of solid melts. For water, 80 calories are absorbed for each gram of ice melted. Here 40 g of ice is melted. Therefore, the amount of heat absorbed by the ice is 40 times the heat of fusion. 40 g \u00d7 80 cal/g = 3200 cal. As such, 3200 calories are absorbed when the ice melts.

The specific heat is defined as the number of calories needed to raise 1 g of liquid 1 degree. The specific heat of water is 1, which means that for every gram of water raised 1 degree, 1 calorie is absorbed. In calculating the amount of heat absorbed by the water to the new temperature, let t = new temperature. To find the amount of heat absorbed, multply the specific heat by 40 g, because 40 g of water is present, and by the new temperature, t, because the water will be raised t degrees from zero.

A mole is defined as the number of grams of a sub-stance divided by its molecular weight. In other words, a mole = [(amount in grams of substance) / (molecular weight of substance)] In the given equation: Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 + 3BaCl_2 3BaSO_4\\downarrow + 2FeCl_3, the numbers before each compound are termed coefficients (the coefficient of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 is one, and by convention is not written). The equation is balanced. This means that all of the elements are equal in number on both sides of the equation. For example, we have a total of 12 oxygen atoms on the left and 12 on the right. Before doing any problem involving a chemical equation, we must always balance it. All the atoms must be accounted for. The coefficients serve this purpose. After balancing, they also tell you the relative mole amounts that will react. In other words, in this reaction 1 mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 reacts with 3 moles of BaCl_2. For the reaction to occur, we must have a mole ratio of 1 : 3 between Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 and BaCl_2. If such a condition exists, then the equation tells us that 3 moles of BaSO_4 will be produced per mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. In addition, 2molesof FeCl_3 will also be produced. There-fore, the coefficients tell the relative number of moles of each substance that must be either present or produced. With this information, we can now answer the questions. (A)We have 10 grams of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 and want the number of grams of BaCl_2 that are required to react with it. The molecular weight of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 is 399.88 g/mole. This number is obtained by adding up all the atomic weights of the individual atoms in the formula. Recalling the definition of a mole, we have 10/399.88molesof Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. The equation tells us that 3 moles of BaCl_2 react with one mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. Therefore, we must have 3 times the number of moles of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3or 3 \u00d7 [(10)/(399.88)] = [(30)/(399.88)]. The number of BaCl_2 required is, therefore, [(30)/(399.88)]. The molecular weight of BaCl_2 is 208.24 g/mole. Recall, mole = number of grams/mole-cular weight. The number of grams of BaCl_2 required is, therefore, [(30) / (399.88)] moles \u00d7 208.24 g/mole = 15.62 grams (B) We want to produce 100 grams of BaSO_4. The molecular weight of BaSO_4 is 233.40 g/mole. Therefore, we want to produce 100/233.40molesof BaSO_4. How much Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 should be used? Again, we must go back to the equation and look at the coefficients to determine the mole requirements. We see that 3 moles of BaSO_4 are pro-duced for every mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. Therefore, the required number of moles of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 is 1/3 the number of moles of BaSO_4 or (1/3) \u00d7 [(100) / (233.40)] = [(100)/(700.20)]. The molecular weight of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 is 399.88 g/mole. Consequently, the number of grams required of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 is [(100) / (700.20) mole \u00d7 399.88 g/mole = 57.11 grams (c) In this question, we are working with a mixture of two substances to produce a third. The first thing is to compute the moles: Moles Fe_2 (SO_4)_3= [(50.00 g) / (399.88)] = .125 moles Moles BaCl_2= [(100 g) / (208.24 g/mole)] = .48moles Because we are dealing with two substances to yield one, we must also consider their mole ratios as well as with the product FeC1_3. The equation calls for three moles of BaC1_2 to react with one mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 We have .125 moles of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. 3 times this amount is .375moles. However, you have .48 moles of BaCl_2. This means, there-fore, that we have .48 - .375 or .105. moles of BaCl_2 that will not react. In other words, BaCl_2 is in excess. We always take the limiting reagent, which is Fe_2 (SO_4)_3. The amount of FeCl_3 present will reflect the number of moles of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3, and not BaCl_2. Because 2 moles of FeCl_3 will be produced for every mole of Fe_2 (SO_4)_3, .125 \u00d7 2 = .25 moles of FeCl_3 will be produced. The molecular weight of FeC1_3 is 162.20.

Once this is done, the answers to (1) and (2) follow directly. One is adding a base of a given amount to an acid of a given amount. This is a neutralization; i.e., the reaction of an acid and base to produce a salt and water. One is told there are 100 ml of 1.5 NNaOHand 100 ml of 3.0 N H_3PO_4 solution. N = normality, which is defined as equivalents/liter. An equivalent = the number ofhydroniumions that an acid can produce or hydroxide ions that a base can produce per mole of that substance. In a neutral solution the number of equivalents of base is equal to the number of equivalents of acid. Thus, to see to what extent the reaction has proceeded, calculate the equivalents of base and acid. If they are equal, the re-action went to completion. Recall, N = equivalents/liter. Thus, equivalentsNaOH = (1.5 equiv/l)100ml/1000 m/l = 0.15 equiv. Equivalents H_3PO_4 = (3.0 equiv/l) 100ml/1000l = 0.30 equiv. The equivalents of acid do NOT equal those of the base. The H_3PO_4 has 0.30 - 0.15 = 0.15 equivalents that do not react. The rest has been neutralized by the base to form a salt and water. H_3PO_4 is a polyproticacid, which means it can donate 3 protons when a mole of it exists. Since only one-half of the equivalents are neutralized, only one-half of the protons were used. This means that the reaction H_3PO_4 + OH^- \\rightleftarrows H_2PO_4^- + H_2O goes to completion, but H_2PO_4- + OH^- \\rightleftarrows HPO^2_4^- + H_2O will only be half complete. With this information, (1) can be answered. One started with 1.5 N of 100 mlNaOHsolution, which indicates that 0.15 moles of Na^+ is present.NaOHcan react with only 1 mole ofhydronium ion. Thus, its equi-valents correspond to its moles. 0.30 equivalents of H_3PO_4 correspond to 0.10 moles, since each mole generates 3hydronium ions. In (0.1) H_3PO_4 + (0.15)OH^- \\rightleftarrows (0.1)H_2PO_4^- + (0.1)H_2O + (.05)OH^- there is a total 0.1 moles of H_2PO_4^- generated, since H_3PO_4 is the limiting reagent with only 0.1 moles compared with OH^-'s 0.15 moles. This means that for the reaction; (0.1) H_2PO_4^- + (0.05)OH^- \\rightleftarrows (0.05) HPO^2_4^- + (0.05)H_2O + (0.05)H_2PO_4^-, 0.05 moles of OH^- is left to react with the 0.1 moles of H_2PO_4^- generated previously. Thus, only 0.05molesof H_2PO_4^- is consumed in producing 0.05 moles of HPO^2_4^-. Thus, anunreactedamount of 0.05 moles of HPO_4^- is left. In summary, the species in solution are 0.05 moles each of H_2PO^2_4^- and HPO^2_4^- with small amounts of H_3O^+, H_3PO_4, PO^3_4^-, OH^- and 0.15 moles Na+. One can now calculate the pH of this.

Once this is done, the answers to (1) and (2) follow directly. One is adding a base of a given amount to an acid of a given amount. This is a neutralization; i.e., the reaction of an acid and base to produce a salt and water. One is told there are 100 ml of 1.5 NNaOHand 100 ml of 3.0 N H_3PO_4 solution. N = normality, which is defined as equivalents/liter. An equivalent = the number ofhydroniumions that an acid can produce or hydroxide ions that a base can produce per mole of that substance. In a neutral solution the number of equivalents of base is equal to the number of equivalents of acid. Thus, to see to what extent the reaction has proceeded, calculate the equivalents of base and acid. If they are equal, the re-action went to completion. Recall, N = equivalents/liter. Thus, equivalentsNaOH = (1.5 equiv/l)100ml/1000 m/l = 0.15 equiv. Equivalents H_3PO_4 = (3.0 equiv/l) 100ml/1000l = 0.30 equiv. The equivalents of acid do NOT equal those of the base. The H_3PO_4 has 0.30 - 0.15 = 0.15 equivalents that do not react. The rest has been neutralized by the base to form a salt and water. H_3PO_4 is a polyproticacid, which means it can donate 3 protons when a mole of it exists. Since only one-half of the equivalents are neutralized, only one-half of the protons were used. This means that the reaction H_3PO_4 + OH^- \\rightleftarrows H_2PO_4^- + H_2O goes to completion, but H_2PO_4- + OH^- \\rightleftarrows HPO^2_4^- + H_2O will only be half complete. With this information, (1) can be answered. One started with 1.5 N of 100 mlNaOHsolution, which indicates that 0.15 moles of Na^+ is present.NaOHcan react with only 1 mole ofhydronium ion. Thus, its equi-valents correspond to its moles. 0.30 equivalents of H_3PO_4 correspond to 0.10 moles, since each mole generates 3hydronium ions. In (0.1) H_3PO_4 + (0.15)OH^- \\rightleftarrows (0.1)H_2PO_4^- + (0.1)H_2O + (.05)OH^- there is a total 0.1 moles of H_2PO_4^- generated, since H_3PO_4 is the limiting reagent with only 0.1 moles compared with OH^-'s 0.15 moles. This means that for the reaction; (0.1) H_2PO_4^- + (0.05)OH^- \\rightleftarrows (0.05) HPO^2_4^- + (0.05)H_2O + (0.05)H_2PO_4^-, 0.05 moles of OH^- is left to react with the 0.1 moles of H_2PO_4^- generated previously. Thus, only 0.05molesof H_2PO_4^- is consumed in producing 0.05 moles of HPO^2_4^-. Thus, anunreactedamount of 0.05 moles of HPO_4^- is left. In summary, the species in solution are 0.05 moles each of H_2PO^2_4^- and HPO^2_4^- with small amounts of H_3O^+, H_3PO_4, PO^3_4^-, OH^- and 0.15 moles Na+. One can now calculate the pH of this. There exists some H_2PO_4^- in solution. This is the source ofhydroniumions, whose pH is measured by pH = - log [H_3O^+]. The reaction is H_2PO_4^- + H_2O \\rightleftarrows H_3O^+ + HPO^2_4^-.

When a gas dissociates, more molecules are produced, and at constant temperature and pressure the volume increases. The density at constant pressure then decreases, and the difference between the density of the undissociated gas and that of the partially dissociated gas is directly related to the degree of dis-sociation.

The alcohol content changes at -10 degrees C\nC.             Whisky becomes solid at -10 degrees C\nD. Whisky is still a liquid and can be consumed.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nTo findmolarity, mole fraction, andmolality, you need to know how many moles of alcohol are present in the whiskey. You can obtain this from a calculation using the density. To find whether you can still drink the whisky at - 10\\textdegreeC, requires you to know its freezing point, since you cannot drink something if it is frozen. You can deter mine the freezing point of the Scotch by determining the freezing point depression of the water containing the alcohol. This is found from\\DeltaT_f=K_fm, where\\DeltaT_f= the depression,K_f= freezing point depression constant, and m =molality. You now proceed as follows: You are told that 100 proof means 50 percent alcohol by volume. This means that 1 liter of components possess 500 cm^3 of ethyl alcohol (a liter = 1000 cm^3). Density = mass/volume. You know the density and volume, so that mass of alcohol = density \u00d7 volume = .79(500) = 395 g. Molecular wt. of the alcohol = 46.07 g. Thus, you have 395/46.07 = 8.57 moles of alcohol. Hence, molarity= [(moles of solute)/(liters of solution)] = 8.57 / 1 = 8.57 M. Molarity= [(moles of solute)/(kilograms of solvent)]. To find the number of grams of solvent, you need to use the density again. In 1 liter of Scotch Whisky, you have 500 cm^3 of water. Density of water = 1 g/ cm^3. Thus, mass of water = 500 cm^3 (1 g/ cm^3) = 500 grams. Thus, Molality= [(8.57) / {(500/1000)}] = 17.14 m You divided 500 by 1000 sincemolalityis moles per 1000 g of solvent.
