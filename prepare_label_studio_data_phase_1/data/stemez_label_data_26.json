Consider an atomic system which has two atomic levels.

Now if we shine radiation of frequency\u01b2 on this confined system, there will be transitions j toiandito j. Because of the population density, we expect more to goito j than j toi. As a result, we see that we need to get a population density inversion so that there will be more j states thani states occupied. With the external radiation of frequency v, more transitions will occur j toithanito j, and as a result, more radiation out than the incident radiation. In going fromito j the external radiation is absorbed (lost) while from j toiwe still have the incident photon plus the j toiphoton in our beam. So, to keep our energy balance, the energy into the atomic system must equal the sum of theito j transitions and losses of photons to the surroundings. In practice, we use an atomic system that has more than two energy levels, including the statesiand j, and such that in the chain of transitions, ametastablestate exists to promote the population density inversion. In addition, we arrange our system so that most of the radiation is trapped in the confined region with a relatively small amount of the stimulated emission being able to escape from the region.

In addition, [(n_2 - n_1) / R] is the effectivefocal length of the spherical interface. Recall that the focal length ofa spherical mirror of radius R is (R / 2). To find successively the image formed by each interface from the objectof the previous interface, first substitute the following given values intoequation (1): s_1 =2R ,n_1 = 1.0andn_2 = 1.5 Then, equation (1) becomes (1 / 2R) + (1.5 / s_2)= [(1.5 - 1) / R] (1.5 / s_2)= (1 / 2R) - (1 / 2R) = 0 s_2= \\infty This means that the image created by the first surface of the original objectis an infinite distance from the intersection of the axis with the first sphericalinterface. This also means that the rays from the initial object will beparallel to the mirror's axis as they encounter the mirror.

First, the thin lens equation can be used to locate the position of the exit pupil. Since the screen is a distance of 14 cm away from the lens and the lens has a focal length of 10 cm, the source location can be found.

Color-correction factor depends on the photometric calibration\nB. Color-correction factor is necessary only for white lights\nC.             Color-correction factor is always necessary\nD. No color-correction factor is necessary\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nAll electro-optical methods of directly measuring light in photometric units contain the inherent problem that it is necessary to shape the response function of the optics-photoreceptor system of the photometer to closely match the 1931 CIEphotopicluminosity function. This CIE function has been universally adopted as descriptive of human daylight (photopic) visual response. The matching of CIE response, however, is never perfect. In the photometry of colored signals in particular, there may be large differences in the results obtained through the use of presumably duplicate instruments. Even in the photometry of nominally \"white\" lights, large differences in measurement may be encountered when \"color temperature changing\" filters or lamp dyes are incorporated in the lamps or signal devices and the resulting spectral energy distributions (SED's) depart significantly from the SED of the tungsten lamp that was used to establish the initial photometric calibration. When dealing withtelephotometers, the spectral response of the complete photometer (not merely the built-in filter and photomultiplier combination) must first be determined. Should the overall response of a focused photometer prove to be virtually that of the CIE luminosity function, then no \"color corrections\" would have to be applied. Should the spectral response of the photometer system have significant departures from the CIE curve, then valid corrections would require computations based on radiometric analysis of the SED of the colored light signal and of the light source used in the photometric calibration of the photometer. If an electro-optical photometer could be designed to have a spectral sensitivity exactly in the form of the CIE Standard Observer, no \"color-correction\" factor would be needed. The photometer could be calibrated against any standard of known luminance. Measurements could then be made on any light or surface no matter how its SED might differ from that of the luminance standard and the calibrated photometer would yield correct results. Photometers generally do not have spectral sensitivities that correspond precisely enough with the CIE (photopic) Standard Observer. Even so, if the SED of the light being tested corresponds exactly with the SED of the standard used in calibrating the photometer, no correction is necessary. Thus, there are two conditions, either one of which if met, permits correct photometric measurements to be made without the necessity of applying corrections: (1) If the photometer response is precisely that of the CIE Standard Observer. (2) If the SED of the standard of luminance and that of the light being tested are precisely alike. In general, neither condition is met, and a correction must be made which takes into account the difference between the photometer's response and the CIE Standard Observer, as well as the difference between the SED of the calibrating standard and the SED of the light under test. The complete procedure calls for calibrating the photometer against a luminance standard having a known luminance, L_s . The calibration factor, F, of the photometer, is then given by the equation F = (L_s / R_s), where R_s is the reading of the photometer for the luminance L_s . For those photometers that have an adjustable gain control, the reading, R_s, may be adjusted so that F = 1 or a decimal multiple of 1. If no color-correction factor is required-that is, if either of the two conditions cited above is met-then a measurement, L, of luminance is obtained from a photometer reading, R, on a test object, by the equation L = FR. If a color-correction is required, then L = CFR. Hence, the luminance, L, represented by a reading, R, in the photometer, is equal to the product of the reading, the calibration factor, F, and the color-correction factor, C. An equation for C is C = (S_8 / S_6) \u00d7 (S_7 / S_9)(1) where the four S terms are defined as follows: S_6 = E_S = eye response to standard lamp S_7 = E_T = eye response to signal (test) lamp S_8 = P_S = photometer response to standard lamp S_9 = P_T = photometer response to signal (test) lamp. Hence, equation (1) may be written as follows: C = (P_S / E_S) \u00d7 (E_T / P_T) or, rearranging the terms, C = (P_S / E_T) \u00d7 (E_T / P_S)(2) The two fractions on the right, (P_S / E_T) and (E_T / P_S), have aspeciaI contributory significance to the overall color-correction. Equation (2) may be written as follows: C = C_P \u00d7 C_E where C_P = (P_S / P_T) and C_E = (E_T / P_S) C_P is a correction factor that takes into account the difference in response of the photometer to the standard and test light, and C_E accounts for the differences in response of the eye (CIE Standard Observer) to the two energy distributions. C_P and C_E are independent of each other-that is, C_P is not affected by eye response, and C_E is a function of the two SED's and the eye response characteristic. A hypothetical nonselective photoreceptor-that is, a radiation detector equally sensitive at all wavelengths-responds to radiant energy without regard to the SED. If the standard and the testluminances, although different in SED, happen to have equal radiances (the radiant energy analog of luminance), the nonselective receptor will measure them as equal and C_P = 1. In other words, the receptor could be calibrated with light of one SED and measure the light of the other SED without correction. (It should be emphasized again that eye response is not considered in C_P). If, however, a selective photoreceptor is used, the response to different SED's may be quite different. If the photoreceptor, for example, responds twice as strongly to the test light as to the standard, for equal radiant energy content, the measurements on the test lamp should be reduced by 50%.

C_P corrects the photoreceptor for the difference between its response to the radiant energy with which it is calibrated and that which is being measured. C_E takes into account the fact that the eye may respond quite differently to lights of equal radiant energy but different SED's. Hence, if the eye responds twice as strongly to the test light as to the standard, the photoreceptor test readings should be doubled, etc. Assuming that the spectral energy distributions of the light being tested and the standard used in calibrating the photometer are identical, E_T, = E_S and P_T = P_S. Hence, from equation (2), C = (P_S / P_T) \u00d7(E_T / E_S) = 1. Therefore, no color-correction factor is necessary.", "ref_id": 5346, "meta_info": {"subject": "physics.csv", "src": "stemez-Optics", "question": "Describe the significance of the color-correction factor and show that if the spectral energy distributions of the light being tested and the standard used in calibrating the photometer are identical to one another, no correction is required.", "options": ["Color-correction factor depends on the photometric calibration", "Color-correction factor is necessary only for white lights", "Color-correction factor is always necessary", "No color-correction factor is necessary"], "answer": "D", "solution": "All electro-optical methods of directly measuring light in photometric units contain the inherent problem that it is necessary to shape the response function of the optics-photoreceptor system of the photometer to closely match the 1931 CIEphotopicluminosity function. This CIE function has been universally adopted as descriptive of human daylight (photopic) visual response. The matching of CIE response, however, is never perfect. In the photometry of colored signals in particular, there may be large differences in the results obtained through the use of presumably duplicate instruments. Even in the photometry of nominally \"white\" lights, large differences in measurement may be encountered when \"color temperature changing\" filters or lamp dyes are incorporated in the lamps or signal devices and the resulting spectral energy distributions (SED's) depart significantly from the SED of the tungsten lamp that was used to establish the initial photometric calibration. When dealing withtelephotometers, the spectral response of the complete photometer (not merely the built-in filter and photomultiplier combination) must first be determined. Should the overall response of a focused photometer prove to be virtually that of the CIE luminosity function, then no \"color corrections\" would have to be applied. Should the spectral response of the photometer system have significant departures from the CIE curve, then valid corrections would require computations based on radiometric analysis of the SED of the colored light signal and of the light source used in the photometric calibration of the photometer. If an electro-optical photometer could be designed to have a spectral sensitivity exactly in the form of the CIE Standard Observer, no \"color-correction\" factor would be needed. The photometer could be calibrated against any standard of known luminance. Measurements could then be made on any light or surface no matter how its SED might differ from that of the luminance standard and the calibrated photometer would yield correct results. Photometers generally do not have spectral sensitivities that correspond precisely enough with the CIE (photopic) Standard Observer. Even so, if the SED of the light being tested corresponds exactly with the SED of the standard used in calibrating the photometer, no correction is necessary. Thus, there are two conditions, either one of which if met, permits correct photometric measurements to be made without the necessity of applying corrections: (1) If the photometer response is precisely that of the CIE Standard Observer. (2) If the SED of the standard of luminance and that of the light being tested are precisely alike. In general, neither condition is met, and a correction must be made which takes into account the difference between the photometer's response and the CIE Standard Observer, as well as the difference between the SED of the calibrating standard and the SED of the light under test. The complete procedure calls for calibrating the photometer against a luminance standard having a known luminance, L_s . The calibration factor, F, of the photometer, is then given by the equation F = (L_s / R_s), where R_s is the reading of the photometer for the luminance L_s . For those photometers that have an adjustable gain control, the reading, R_s, may be adjusted so that F = 1 or a decimal multiple of 1. If no color-correction factor is required-that is, if either of the two conditions cited above is met-then a measurement, L, of luminance is obtained from a photometer reading, R, on a test object, by the equation L = FR. If a color-correction is required, then L = CFR. Hence, the luminance, L, represented by a reading, R, in the photometer, is equal to the product of the reading, the calibration factor, F, and the color-correction factor, C. An equation for C is C = (S_8 / S_6) \u00d7 (S_7 / S_9)(1) where the four S terms are defined as follows: S_6 = E_S = eye response to standard lamp S_7 = E_T = eye response to signal (test) lamp S_8 = P_S = photometer response to standard lamp S_9 = P_T = photometer response to signal (test) lamp. Hence, equation (1) may be written as follows: C = (P_S / E_S) \u00d7 (E_T / P_T) or, rearranging the terms, C = (P_S / E_T) \u00d7 (E_T / P_S)(2) The two fractions on the right, (P_S / E_T) and (E_T / P_S), have aspeciaI contributory significance to the overall color-correction. Equation (2) may be written as follows: C = C_P \u00d7 C_E where C_P = (P_S / P_T) and C_E = (E_T / P_S) C_P is a correction factor that takes into account the difference in response of the photometer to the standard and test light, and C_E accounts for the differences in response of the eye (CIE Standard Observer) to the two energy distributions. C_P and C_E are independent of each other-that is, C_P is not affected by eye response, and C_E is a function of the two SED's and the eye response characteristic. A hypothetical nonselective photoreceptor-that is, a radiation detector equally sensitive at all wavelengths-responds to radiant energy without regard to the SED. If the standard and the testluminances, although different in SED, happen to have equal radiances (the radiant energy analog of luminance), the nonselective receptor will measure them as equal and C_P = 1. In other words, the receptor could be calibrated with light of one SED and measure the light of the other SED without correction. (It should be emphasized again that eye response is not considered in C_P). If, however, a selective photoreceptor is used, the response to different SED's may be quite different. If the photoreceptor, for example, responds twice as strongly to the test light as to the standard, for equal radiant energy content, the measurements on the test lamp should be reduced by 50%. Or, if the photoreceptor reading on the test lamp is one-third of the reading on the standard, for equal energy content, the test reading should be multiplied by three. A similar analysis may be carried out to explain C_E. Here, C_E evaluates the different response of the eye to different SED's. C_P corrects the photoreceptor for the difference between its response to the radiant energy with which it is calibrated and that which is being measured. C_E takes into account the fact that the eye may respond quite differently to lights of equal radiant energy but different SED's. Hence, if the eye responds twice as strongly to the test light as to the standard, the photoreceptor test readings should be doubled, etc. Assuming that the spectral energy distributions of the light being tested and the standard used in calibrating the photometer are identical, E_T, = E_S and P_T = P_S. Hence, from equation (2), C = (P_S / P_T) \u00d7(E_T / E_S) = 1.

Each of the receptors has a different spectral response. To codify this response, the international Commission on Illumination has developed a color mixture curve representing the response of three receptors such that the area under the individual spectral response curves are equal. By this codification a specific color can be specified by threetristimulusvalues,x,y, andz. These values include not only the spectral response but also the intensity of the light. As three values are necessary to specify a color, it appears that there is a need for a three dimensional representation to specify a particular color mixture. To avoid this, thetristimulusvalues are normalized as follows: x = [x/ (x+y+z)]; y = [y/ (x+y+z)]; z = [z/ (x+y+z)](1) where x, y, and z are called thetrichromaticcoefficients. Since by definition, x + y + z= 1, a two dimensional representation of these parameters is sufficient, as any one of the parameters is dependent upon the other two. Since thetristimulusvalues indicate both flux and spectral response and the effect of several sources is additive, it can be seen that white light corresponds to the following values for x, y, and z : x = y = z = 0.3333. Thetrichromaticcoefficients can be calculated by making use of equation (1): x = [20 / (20 + 60 + 20)] = [20 / (100)] = 0.2 ; y = [60 / (100)] = 0.6 ; z = [20 / (100)] = 0.2(2) x' = [20 / (20 + 60 + 20)] = (20 / 50) = 0.4 ; y' = (10 / 50) = 0.2 ; z' = (20 / 50) = 0.4(3) (b) Note thatx+y+z= 100, whilex'+y'+z'= 50. Hence, the flux of the first source is twice that of the second. Also since ax +bx' = x\" = ay + by' = y\" =az+bz' = z\"(4) where a and b are constants, it can be seen that a = 1 and b = 2 yields x\" = y\" = z\" = 1. Thus, the second source must provide twice the illumination on the surface that the first source provides. Since the intensity of the first source is initially twice that of the second source, the expression relating the illumination provided by the first source, E_1, to the illumination provided by the second source, E_2, must be as follows: E_1 = (1/4) E_2(5) or (E_2 / E_1) = 4(6) The inverse square law is as follows: E \\propto [(Icos\\texttheta) / r^2](7) where I is the intensity of the source, \\texttheta is the angle between a normal to the surface and a ray from the source to the surface and r is the source-surface distance. Substituting the ratio [{(I_2cos\\texttheta) / (r_2^2)} / {(I_1cos\\texttheta) / (r_1^2)}] for (E_2 / E_1) (from equation (7)) into equation (6) gives the following result: [{(I_2cos\\texttheta) / (r_2^2)} / {(I_1cos\\texttheta) / (r_1^2)}] = 4(8) Assuming that I_1 = I_2, equation (8) becomes [(r_1^2) / (r_2^2)] = 4(9) or (r_1 / r_2) = 2.

By this codification a specific color can be specified by threetristimulusvalues,x,y, andz. These values include not only the spectral response but also the intensity of the light. As three values are necessary to specify a color, it appears that there is a need for a three dimensional representation to specify a particular color mixture. To avoid this, thetristimulusvalues are normalized as follows: x = [x/ (x+y+z)]; y = [y/ (x+y+z)]; z = [z/ (x+y+z)](1) where x, y, and z are called thetrichromaticcoefficients. Since by definition, x + y + z= 1, a two dimensional representation of these parameters is sufficient, as any one of the parameters is dependent upon the other two. Since thetristimulusvalues indicate both flux and spectral response and the effect of several sources is additive, it can be seen that white light corresponds to the following values for x, y, and z : x = y = z = 0.3333. Thetrichromaticcoefficients can be calculated by making use of equation (1): x = [20 / (20 + 60 + 20)] = [20 / (100)] = 0.2 ; y = [60 / (100)] = 0.6 ; z = [20 / (100)] = 0.2(2) x' = [20 / (20 + 60 + 20)] = (20 / 50) = 0.4 ; y' = (10 / 50) = 0.2 ; z' = (20 / 50) = 0.4(3) (b) Note thatx+y+z= 100, whilex'+y'+z'= 50. Hence, the flux of the first source is twice that of the second. Also since ax +bx' = x\" = ay + by' = y\" =az+bz' = z\"(4) where a and b are constants, it can be seen that a = 1 and b = 2 yields x\" = y\" = z\" = 1. Thus, the second source must provide twice the illumination on the surface that the first source provides. Since the intensity of the first source is initially twice that of the second source, the expression relating the illumination provided by the first source, E_1, to the illumination provided by the second source, E_2, must be as follows: E_1 = (1/4) E_2(5) or (E_2 / E_1) = 4(6) The inverse square law is as follows: E \\propto [(Icos\\texttheta) / r^2](7) where I is the intensity of the source, \\texttheta is the angle between a normal to the surface and a ray from the source to the surface and r is the source-surface distance. Substituting the ratio [{(I_2cos\\texttheta) / (r_2^2)} / {(I_1cos\\texttheta) / (r_1^2)}] for (E_2 / E_1) (from equation (7)) into equation (6) gives the following result: [{(I_2cos\\texttheta) / (r_2^2)} / {(I_1cos\\texttheta) / (r_1^2)}] = 4(8) Assuming that I_1 = I_2, equation (8) becomes [(r_1^2) / (r_2^2)] = 4(9) or (r_1 / r_2) = 2. Thus, r_1 = 2r_2, and so, the desired ratio is 2:1.

We will assume that the weaving of the curtain is the same both vertically and horizontally. From any standard optics text that includesFraunhoferdiffraction of a rectangular aperture we find that the intensity of light behaves as I = C [(sin^2\\alpha) / \\alpha^2] [(sin^2\\beta) / \\beta^2],where C is a constant. and\\alpha = (\\pib/ \\lambda) sin \\texttheta;\\beta = [(\\pidsin \\texttheta) / \\lambda],and b and d are dimensions of the aperture, \\lambda is the wavelength and \\texttheta is the angle from the aperture-screen perpendicular axis to the screen point at which the intensity is sought, \\alpha and \\beta represent the path difference of the light from the aperture. To have maxima, the path differences must have a difference of an integer number of wavelengths and for minima the path differences must be odd multiples of a half-wavelength. As we look at our intensity equation we see that successive maxima will occur with \\alpha = (\\pi / 2), (3\\pi / 2), (5\\pi / 2) . . . and for successive minima for \\alpha = \\pi, 2\\pi ; 3\\pi. Note that \\alpha = 0 yields a maximum (i.e. lim_\\alpha\\rightarrow0 [(sin \\alpha) / \\alpha] = 1, which can be seen by applyingL'Hospital'srule: lim_\\alpha\\rightarrow0 [(sin \\alpha) / \\alpha] = lim_\\alpha\\rightarrow0 [(cos\\alpha) / 1] = 1). In this case the angular difference in \\texttheta between two minima is 0.3\\textdegree. We expect both maxima and minima to be reasonably evenly spaced so we choose the easier one to calculate. The first two minima occur for \\alpha = \\pi and \\alpha = 2\\pi.
