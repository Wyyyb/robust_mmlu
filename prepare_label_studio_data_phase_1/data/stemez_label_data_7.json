The controls are mechanisms that regulate the heart rate\nD. The controls are nerve impulses in the body\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThe mechanisms responsible for the re-gulation-of body fluid volume depend on the fact that an increase in blood volume causes an increase in blood pressure. One such mechanism operates in the capillaries of all tissues. Here, increased blood volume, because it increases blood pressure, tends to increase the pressure within the capillaries. When this occurs, the pressure that tends to move fluid out of the capillaries into the interstitial space becomes greater than the colloid osmotic pressure, the force which tends to move fluid from theinterstitium back into the capillaries (see previous solution). What results is a net movement of fluid out of the capillaries. Eventually, this movement causes a reduction of blood volume, which in turn reduces the blood pressure. Capillary pressure decreases, and there is a net movement of fluid from the extracellular space back into the capillaries. This is due both to the decreased capillary pressure and to a rise in the colloid osmotic pressure in the blood caused by the drop in plasma volume. Fluid thus enters the capil-laries, restoring normal blood volume and normal blood pressure. A second process stabilizing blood volume occurs at the glomerulus-capsule junction. As blood volume increases, the pressure within theglomeruliof the kidneys likewise increases. Filtration pressure, being proportional to theglomerularcapillary pressure, rises also and more urine is subsequently formed. This reduces the fluid volume of the blood, thus decreasing the blood pressure. A third fluid volume regulating process is base on the presence of baroreceptorsin the walls of the arteries in the chest and neck. Increased blood volume exerts a stronger pressure on the arteries, stretching them. Thebaroreceptorsrespond to this stretching of the arterial walls and send impulses to the vasomotor center in the brain. From here, impulses are sent to the smooth muscle in the walls of the afferent renal arterioles, causing them to relax. This relaxation allows the arterioles to dilate and increase the flow of blood into theglomeruli; more blood will be filtered and more water eliminated.

The skin's primary function is to enhance physical appearance\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nPerhaps the most vital function of the skin is to protect the body against a variety of external agents and to maintain a constant internal environment. The layers of the skin form a protective shield against blows, friction, and many injurious chemicals. These layers are essentially germproof, and as long as they are not broken, keep bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin is water-repellent and therefore protects the body from excessive loss of moisture. In addition, the pigment in the outer layers protects the underlying layers from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. In addition to its role in protection, the skin is involved in thermoregulation. Heat is constantly being produced by the metabolic processes of the body cells and distributed by the bloodstream. Heat may be lost from the body in expired breath, feces, and urine, but approximately 90 per cent of the total heat loss occurs through the skin. This is accomplished by changes in the blood supply to the capillaries in the skin. When the air 'temperature is high, the skin capillaries dilate, and the increased flow of blood results in increased heat loss. Due to the increased blood supply, the skin appears flushed. When the temperature is low, the arterioles of the skin are constricted, thereby decreasing the flow of blood through the skin and decreasing the rate of heat loss. Temperature-sensitive nerve endings in the skin reflexively control the arteriole diameters. At high temperatures, the sweat glands are stimulated to secrete sweat. The evaporation of sweat from the surface of the skin lowers the body temperature by removing from the body the heat necessary to convert the liquid sweat into water vapor. In addition to their function in heat loss, the sweat glands also serve an excretory function. Five to ten per cent of all metabolic wastes are excreted by the sweat glands.

Each heartbeat consists of a period of contraction or systole, followed by a period of relaxation, or diastole. Since the normal heart rate is 70 beats per minute, each complete beat (systole and diastole) lasts .85 second. The atria and the ventricles do not contract simultaneously. The atria contract first, withatrialsystole lasting .15 seconds. The ventricles then con-tract, with ventricular systole lasting .30 second. Diastole therefore lasts .40 second. The cardiac cycle begins withatrialsystole. The wave-like contraction of the atria is stimulated by the impulse of thesino-atrialor S-A node. The contraction forces into the ventricles only 30% of the blood that will fill them. How the other 70% enters the ventricles will be explained shortly. During contraction of the two atria, the tricuspid and bicuspid valves are opened. There is a very brief pause before ven-tricular systole begins due to the delay in transmission of the cardiac impulse at the atrio-ventricular or A-V node. The impulse is then transmitted to the A-V bundle and bundle branches and then very rapidly to the Purkinje fibers, which stimulate the ventricles to contract as a unit. The contraction of the ventricular muscles causes a rapid increase in pressure in the ventricles. This increased ventricular pressure immediately closes the tricuspid and bicuspid valves, preventing backflow of the blood into the atria. It is important to realize that the valves work passively. There is no nervous stimulation which directly regu-lates their opening and closing; it is only the difference in pressure due to the relative amount of blood in the atria and ventricles (or ventricles and arteries) which controls this. As ventricular systole progresses, the ventricular pressure further increases (due to contraction). At this point, no blood is en-tering the ventricles, since the tri- and bicuspid valves are closed, and no blood is leaving, since the semilunarvalves are closed. When the-ventricular pressure becomes greater than the pressure in the arteries (the pulmonary artery and the aorta), thesemilunarvalves open and blood is forced into these vessels. After the ventricles complete their contraction, ventricular diastole begins. As the ventricles relax, the pressure decreases.

Since the pressure in the ventricles is still higher than in the atria, the tri- and bi-cuspid valves are still closed, and no blood enters or leaves the ventricles. But some blood is entering the now relaxed atria. During further relaxation of the ventricles, the ventricular pres-sure continues to decrease until it falls below theatrialpressure. At this point, the tri- and bicuspid valves open, allowing blood to rapidly flow into the ventricles. The atria do not contract to force this blood into the ventricles. It is a passive flow due to the fact that theatrialpressure is greater than the ventricular pressure. This flow allows for 70% of the ventricular filling beforeatrialsystole.

Reduced salt intake helps in weight loss.\nB. Reduced salt intake decreases the body's cholesterol levels.\nC.             A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure.\nD. Reduced salt intake reduces the risk of kidney stones.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nHypertension or high blood pressure, is caused by abnormalities in arterial pressure regulation. The mean arterial pressure (M.A.P.) is the average pressure throughout the pressure pulse cycle. It is not equal to the average of the systolic and diastolic pressure, since the heart remains in diastole twice as long as in systole. M.A.P. = [(SBP + 2DBP) / 3] = [{120 + 2(80)} / 3] = 93.3 Thus mean arterial pressure is closer to the diastolic than to the systolic blood pressure. Arterial pressure is determined by two factors: cardiac output and total peripheral resistance. The relationship between them is: Pressure = Cardiac Output \u00d7 Total Peripheral Resistance Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle per unit time, and is determined by both the heart rate and the stroke volume. Total peripheral resistance is the resistance of the entire systemic circulation. Any factor that causes an increase in cardiac output or total peripheral resistance will cause an increase in mean arterial pressure. One such factor is the secretion of the hormonealdosteroneby the adrenal cortex.Aldosteroneacts on the tubules of the kidney to increase thereabsorptionof sodium. This increased retention of sodium causes more water to be retained, thereby increasing the volume of the blood. This increased blood volume increases the stroke volume and hence the cardiac output. Arterial blood pressure increases. When excessive aldosteroneis secreted (such as by a tumor in the adrenal cortex), hypertension results. Salt, or sodium chloride, is a source of sodium. A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure. Blood pressure can also be increased by vasoconstriction (constriction of the blood vessels). Constriction causes an increased resistance to flow (since a decrease in vessel radius increases vascular resistance). A protein calledangiotensinII causes both vasoconstriction and stimulation ofaldosteroneproduction and secretion.AngiotensinII is producedenzymaticallyfromangiotensinI, which is converted from angiotensinogen, a glycoprotein made in the liver. The enzyme rennin, formed in the kidney, catalyzes this conversion. Kidney damage can cause anoversecretionof rennin, which causes an increase of angiotensinII, and thus hypertension. Slight hypertension usually accompanies arteriosclerosis, the deposition of fatty material (such as cholesterol) in the arterial walls. The arteries become fibrous and calcified. This buildup of deposits inhibits the flow of blood, increasing resistance to flow and thus increasing the blood pressure needed to overcome the resistance.

These cases, known as \\textquotedblleftessential\\textquotedblright hypertension (because of unknown etiology) appear to be hereditary.

These genes specify the primary amino acid sequence of polypeptides. Oftentimes, related structural genes, such as those whose proteins catalyze sequential reactions in a metabolic pathway, will be positioned in a linear sequence along a region of the chromosome.

An operator gene is a specific region of the DNA molecule that exerts control over a specific group of structural genes by serving as a binding site for a given repressor molecule. When not bound to the repressor, the operator is transcribed along with the structural genes with which it is associated, though it is probably not translated. Promotor genes are also associated with a given gene or group of genes. It serves as a binding site for RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcription of DNA. The operator gene is located between the promotor and structural genes on the chromosome. When the repressor binds to the operator, it prevents the movement of RNA polymerase along the DNA molecule, thereby inhibiting trans-cription of the structural genes.

Differential reproduction is related to the physical strength of the species\nC.             Differential reproduction is when all offsprings have the same genotype\nD. Differential reproduction is purely based on random mating\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nWhen the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating, differential reproduction is said to have occurred. Differential reproduction can result from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or dif-ferences in either zygote viability or offspring fertility. Nonrandom mating may occur due to genotypic variaton, genetic mutations, or both. There are well established behavior patterns of courtship and mating in many species, which are primarily genetically controlled. For example, in many species of birds and fish, a brightly colored spot on the male serves to stimulate the female for copu-lation. Males having this characteristic will succeed in finding a mate easily and more frequently than males with-out this trait, hence producing in their lifetime more offspring carrying their genes. Males lacking this trait will find it difficult to pass their genes on to succeeding generations. Mutations that lead to, formation of bigger or brighter spots will benefit the males with the mutated gene by rendering them more attractive to females. Conversely, mutations that lead to disappearance of these spots or formation of smaller, duller ones, will have a negative selective value. These mutations are inherited by the progeny, perpetuating differential reproduction through nonrandom mating. Success in mating, however, can neither guarantee successful fertilization nor assure large numbers of off-spring. Such factors can also be important in differen-tial reproduction. Differences in the number of gametes produced by different individuals and the proportion of their gametes that will successfully unite with others to form zygotes can be collectively termed differential fecundity. Differential fecundity may be determined ge-netically. Within a species, the individuals producing large numbers of gametes or having a large percentage of successful matings (resulting in fertilization) will nec-essarily contribute the greatest percentage of genes to the next generation. This depends, of course, on the via-bility of the zygotes formed. In environments which result in low zygote viability, individuals having high fecundity will tend to reproduce in larger numbers. In fish, for example, zygotes must be fertilized and also develop in an external environment; those species producing large numbers of both gametes and zygotes will tend to be preserved. Mammals, on the other hand, whose zygotes develop internally, cannot and need not produce such large numbers of gametes or zygotes. In fact, large numbers of zygotes may actually be a disadvantage, since this limits the amount of care and feeding available to each offspring. Another factor affecting the reproducing ability of a given individual or individuals is the fertility of the offspring. The offspring produced as a result of a given mating may be viable, but unless they are themselves fertile, the result is the same as if they were not viable.

We can apply the classical probability model to this problem: P(e_1) = [{number of containers with ebony beetles} / {total number of containers}] = {3 / 8} We now wish to calculate the conditional probability that a container holding red beetles will be selected on the second selection, given an ebony beetle container was drawn on the first. This can be denoted by P(R_2 e_1). Thus, P(R_2 / e_1)= [{number of containers with red beetles} / {total of containers after removal of one ebony}] = [{5} / {8 - 1}] = (5 / 7) The probability we wish to find is P(R_2 and e_1). By the multiplication rule, P(R_2 and e_1)= P(e_1)P(R_2 / e_1) = (3/8)(5/7) = (15 / 56) Thus, the probability of your selecting first a box with ebony beetles and then a box with red beetles is (15 / 56) = 0.268."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nA group of students were invited to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC).

Both equally\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nUpon examining any population for a particular trait, the observed variation among individuals of that population may be the result of genetic differences , environmental differences, or any combined interaction of these two factors. Stated in a more mathematical sense, the total phenotypic variance (V_P) observed in a population is the sum of three factors : the environmental variance (V_E), the genetic variance (V_G), and the variance due to genetic and environmental interaction (V_GE). This can be expressed in the formula: V_P = V_G + V_E + V_GE The V_E component is the expression of all differences which are not genetically based. The V_G component represents all differences which are genetic . The V_GE component is a representation of how the genotypic expression varies in regard to the type of environment in which it is placed . Of these three components V_GE is the most difficult to measure quantitatively . Because of this, V_GE is often disregarded and the following formula is used: H^2 = [{V_G} / {V_P}] What this formula says is that broad heritability {H) is a measure of the degree to which a phenotype is genetically determined and the degree to which it is influenced by natural selection. It does not end there, however, as the component V_G can be further divided into three subcomponents. As we know, some genes are additive in their effect, some dominant, and some epistatic. These are represented by V_A, V_D, and V_I respectively. Therefore: V_G = V_A + V_D + V_I The most significant of these components is V_A, and it is usually the only value considered, hence, h^2 = [{V_A} / {V_P}] (where h represents narrow heritability) A value of h = 1 would indicate a trait not influenced by the environment. A trait with h = 0 has no genetic basis. So, from what we are given the heritability of wing span is: h^2 = [{V_A} / {V_P}] = [{102.0} / {271.4}] = 0.376 For beak length h^2 = [{V_A} / {V_P}] = [{342.9} / {627.8}] = 0.546 Since the heritability value of wing span is a smaller number than the heritability value of beak length, 0.376 < 0.546, it is therefore farther away from one (no environmental influence involved) and closer to zero (no genetic basis).

Gene pool is the diversity of genes in a population; balanced polymorphism is the dominance of a single gene; genetic load is the genetic capacity of an organism.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nPopulation geneticists visualize a population of organisms as a collection of all the genes possessed by the individuals of the population. Such a sum total of genes is termed a gene pool. Each allele in the gene pool has a certain probability of being expressed in the population. The frequency of occurrence of a given genotype in the population is given by the product of the frequencies of its alleles in the gene pool. A gene pool is said to be in equilibrium if the frequency of each individual allele remains constant from generation to generation; that is to say, when there is no change in the genetic composition of the population over a period of time. The term polymorphism refers to the existence in the same interbreeding population of two or more distinct phenotypic forms of a genetically determined trait. The human blood groups 0, A, B, and AB are a classic example of polymorphism. Balanced polymorphism is a state in which the different forms of the polymorphic genotype are maintained together in equilibrium in the population over a period of time, Such a balance can be achieved and maintained through a variety of means, involving, what are often complex genetic-environmental interactions. One condition which produces balanced polymorphism is heterozygote superiority or heterosis. Here the heterozy-gote (Aa) has a survival advantage over both the dominant (AA) and recessive (aa) homozygotes. Thus both alleles are maintained in the population, and neither can eliminate the other. A classic example of this is sickle-cell anemia in a malarial environment. Contrary to what one might expect, the sickle-cell trait is maintained at a relatively high frequency in the population despite its obvious harmful effects. Individuals carrying the recessive sickle-cell gene in the heterozygous state have resistance to malarial infection. When both malaria and sickle-cell anemia are strong selection factors, the heterozygote has superiority, since normal homozygotes are subject to malaria and those homozygous for the sickle-cell gene have sickle-cell anemia. Thus the recessive gene is maintained along with the normal gene, and their traits are kept in balance. Often, a given species maintains different forms in the population because one or the other is favored at varying times in the year. The polymorphism gives the species an overall survival ability throughout the year. In geographic polymorphism, the species population may maintain a variety of forms, each of which is advantageous under specific environment conditions; one form may do better in one area, another in a different area. On the whole, the species is thus able to maintain itself in a variety of areas and environmental conditions, allowing it to become more widespread. Balanced polymorphism is important in evolution because it maintains a certain amount of variability in the population to permit further adaptive changes. However, although a certain amount of variability is advantageous, too great a genetic variety in the population can be harmful. Geneticists reason that different forms have differing effects upon the overall fitness of a population. Given that there is one optimal phenotype, the greater the number of other suboptimal types present, the less the average fitness of the population will be. The presence of these suboptimal forms imposes a condition of genetic load in terms of a reduction in average population fitness.

Exchange of materials happens in the heart\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nIt is in the capillaries that the most important function of circulation occurs; that is, the exchange of nutrients and waste materials between the blood and tissues. There are billions of capillaries, providing a total surface area of over 100 square meters for the exchange of material. Most functional cells in the body are never more than about 25 microns away from a capillary. Capillaries are well-suited for the exchange process. They are both numerous and branch extensively throughout the body. Unlike the arteries and veins, the capillaries have a very thin wall; it is one endothelial cell thick. This thin wall permits rapid diffusion of substances through the capillary membrane. The extensive branching increases the total \\textbackslash cross-sectional area of the capillary system. This serves to slow down the flow of blood in the capillaries, allowing more time for the exchange process to occur. The very small diameter of each of the capillaries (which is not much larger than the diameter of the blood cells which pass through them) provides friction, which increases the resistance to flow. This causes a significant drop in blood pressure in the capillaries, which is important in the filtration of fluid between the capillaries and the interstitial fluid (lying in the space between cells). The most important means by which nutrients and wastes are trans-ferred between the plasma and interstitial fluid is by diffusion. Material must first diffuse into the interstitial fluid before it can enter the cells of the body's tissues. As the blood flows slowly through the capillary, large amounts of water molecules and dis-solved substances diffuse across the capillary wall. The net dif-fusion of substances is proportional to the concentration differ-ence between the two sides of the capillary membrane. For example, the concentration of oxygen in the blood is usually greater than that in the interstitial fluids. Therefore, oxygen diffuses into the in-terstitial fluid and then into the tissues. In the same way, if the concentration of nitrogenous wastes is higher in the tissues than in the blood, they will diffuse into the interstitial fluids and then into the blood. Actual diffusion across the capillary wall occurs in three ways. Water-soluble substances (sodium ions, glucose) diffuse between the plasma and interstitial fluid only through the pores in the capillary membrane. The diameter of the pores (8 - 10 \\AA) allows small molecules such as water, urea, and glucose to pass through, but not larger molecules such as plasma proteins. Lipid-soluble substances diffuse directly through the cell membranes and do not go through the pores (which are filled with water). Oxygen and carbon dioxide permeate all areas of the capillary membranes. Another method by which sub-stances can be transported through the membrane ispinocytosis. Inpinocytosis, the cell membraneinvaginatesand sequesters the sur-rounding substances.

Allergies are adverse immunological responses to antigens. Antihistamines and desensitization therapy can help decrease the effect of allergies.\nD. Allergies are a result of lack of immune response.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nAlthough immune reactions generally have a protective role in the body, they can sometimes cause damage to the body itself. Such an adverse immunological response, called an allergy or hypersensitivity reaction, results from an acquired reactivity to an antigen. The reactivity can result in bodily damage upon subsequent re-exposure to that specific antigen. The allergic response can be elicited by a variety of antigens, including pollen, dust, certain foods and bee stings. Initial exposure to the antigen leads to some anti-body synthesis (the primary response), but also to the formation of more lymphocytes which act as memory cells. Subsequent exposure to the same antigen elicits a more vigorous response (secondary response); many memory cells are stimulated to differentiate into plasma cells which produce the corresponding antibody. These particular antigens stimulate production of IgE immunoglobinswhich circulate in the blood and bind to mast cells (found in connective tissue) andbasophils(a type of white blood cell), When the antigen forms a complex with theIgEattached to the mast cell, release of histamine and other chemicals from the mast cell results. The symptoms of the allergy result from the effects of these chemicals. For example, when a previously sensitized person inhales pollen, the antigenic part of the pollen combines with theIgE-mast cell complex in the respiratory passages. The histamine released causes increased mucous secretion, in-creased blood flow and constriction of smooth muscle lining the passages. These physiological changes cause the familiar symptoms of running nose, congestion and difficulty of breathing. In some people, a very severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can occur which may have systemic (non-localized) symptoms. People have died from anaphylaxis resulting from a bee sting. To decrease the effect of allergies, one can ad-minister antihistamines. These only provide incomplete relief, however, since other chemicals are also released. A therapy called desensitization can help allergic people. In this process, the antigen is injected repeatedly into the person in small but increasing dosages. The theory behind desensitization is that this procedure inducesIgGsynthesis against the antigen.

Moreover, carbohydrate could not have come from the combination of carbon atoms and hydrogen sulfide molecules.

According to this hypothesis, in the photosynthesis of green plants, it is the water molecule, not carbon dioxide, that is split to release O_2. This brilliant speculation was not proven until many years later when advancement of radio - isotopic techniques made it possible to reveal the mechanism of the actual reaction. The use of isotopic oxygen, ^18O, allowed the successful tracing of the path of oxygen from water to free molecular oxygen: CO_2 + 2H_2^18O - CH_2O + H_2O + ^18O_2 Thus, it can readily be seen that molecular oxygen comes actually from water and not from carbon dioxide. It is now known that the splitting of water occurs during the light reactions of photosynthesis, releasing O_2 gas, electrons, which are energized by light to provide for ATP formation, and protons, which are used to form NADPH, the reducing power necessary for carbohydrate formation.

A species is defined as a group of organisms that is closely related structurally and functionally, which in a natural environment inter-breeds and produces fertile offspring, but which seldom, if ever, breeds with organisms of another species. A species is reproductively isolated. The dog and the cat are examples of two different species. Dogs and cats cannot breed with one another. Closely related species may interbreed, however, the offspring are rarely fertile. The horse and the donkey are examples of closely related species which can mate and produce viable offspring. This offspring is the mule, which is unable to reproduce. A mule can only result from the union of a horse and a donkey. The fact that mules are sterile helps to establish the fact that the horse and the donkey are of different species. Species may be subdivided into subspecies, varieties, or races. The varieties are kept distinct either through geographic isolation, seasonal differences in reproductive patterns, or by the intervention of man. Dogs offer an example of controlled breeding. If unres-trained by man, the different varieties interbreed to produce mongrels. In certain cases, interbreeding between different subspecies is very difficult. The greatest problem in the case of dogs would be size; however, sexual attraction between different varieties exists and it can be proven that both varieties belong to the same species because they are structurally and functionally similar. Both the small and large varieties could breed with a medium sized variety, proving that the varieties are not reproductively isolated. If interbreeding between varieties is prevented by seasonal variation of reproduc-tive patterns, careful regulation of laboratory conditions could enable two different subspecies to be ready for reproduction at the same time. In the case of the rat-like animals, the two groups should be studied to see if they are similar structurally and functionally. If so, it must be determined whether the animals could breed with one another. If they could and if they produce fertile offspring, the two groups would be classified as members of the same species. If the off-spring were all sterile, it would mean that the two groups of animals belonged to two different, closely related species.

What role may this playin evolution?\n\nOptions:\nA. Genetic drift is the process of evolution by natural selection.\nB. Genetic drift is the intentional manipulation of gene frequencies in a population by humans.\nC.             Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of gene frequencies due to chance processes in a finite population.\nD. Genetic drift is the systematic alteration of a species' genetic makeup over time.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe random fluctuation of gene frequencies due to chance processesin a finite population is known as genetic drift. Genetic drift may occurby what is commonly referred to as the Founder Principle. This principleoperates by chance factors alone. A group of individuals may leavetheir dwelling and establish a new feeding or breeding ground in an unexploitedarea. The individuals that find the new area may not represent thesame genetic makeup as the original population, since the individuals thatleft were a random group. This exhibits how one population may establishitself with a new genetic composition by chance alone. Genetic driftmay also affect a population without the migration of individuals. Catastrophes in one area of a certain popu-lation, such as a flood, may randomlykill individuals of a population. Those individuals which survive, doso by chance alone and not by possessing any special selective advantage. Thus genetic drift may result from natural catastrophes where arandom group of individuals may survive by chance alone and change theoriginal population's allelic frequencies. The alteration of allelic frequenciesby chance due to genetic drift is unlike the directional movementscaused by the systematic pressures of mutation, selection, anddifferential migration. The situation is quite different in a large population. In large populations, the relatively small numbers of chance variationsin gene frequencies are absorbed into the population in succeedinggenerations and the overall effect is negligible. In small interbreedingpo-pulations, however, where there are limited numbers of progenyin a given generation, random variation has a significant effect andgenetic drift can become an important factor. Random fluctuation can mostoften lead to fixation of a given allele in a small population. That is, one allele is slowly replacing the other as a result of chance, and the former becomes fixed in the population as the latter is lost. This process of reduction ofheterozygositythrough loss and fixation atvarious loci is also known as the decay of variability. The fixation of certain genes by means of genetic drift may explain theappearance of seemingly unimportant and useless structures in some organisms. These structures may be the expression of homozygous gene pairswhich have accumulated in the population by chance alone. Such a lossof variability can also inactivate natural selection, which can act only whena certain degree of phenotypic variation is present.

Genetic drift may occurby what is commonly referred to as the Founder Principle. This principleoperates by chance factors alone. A group of individuals may leavetheir dwelling and establish a new feeding or breeding ground in an unexploitedarea. The individuals that find the new area may not represent thesame genetic makeup as the original population, since the individuals thatleft were a random group. This exhibits how one population may establishitself with a new genetic composition by chance alone. Genetic driftmay also affect a population without the migration of individuals. Catastrophes in one area of a certain popu-lation, such as a flood, may randomlykill individuals of a population. Those individuals which survive, doso by chance alone and not by possessing any special selective advantage. Thus genetic drift may result from natural catastrophes where arandom group of individuals may survive by chance alone and change theoriginal population's allelic frequencies. The alteration of allelic frequenciesby chance due to genetic drift is unlike the directional movementscaused by the systematic pressures of mutation, selection, anddifferential migration. The situation is quite different in a large population. In large populations, the relatively small numbers of chance variationsin gene frequencies are absorbed into the population in succeedinggenerations and the overall effect is negligible. In small interbreedingpo-pulations, however, where there are limited numbers of progenyin a given generation, random variation has a significant effect andgenetic drift can become an important factor. Random fluctuation can mostoften lead to fixation of a given allele in a small population. That is, one allele is slowly replacing the other as a result of chance, and the former becomes fixed in the population as the latter is lost. This process of reduction ofheterozygositythrough loss and fixation atvarious loci is also known as the decay of variability. The fixation of certain genes by means of genetic drift may explain theappearance of seemingly unimportant and useless structures in some organisms. These structures may be the expression of homozygous gene pairswhich have accumulated in the population by chance alone. Such a lossof variability can also inactivate natural selection, which can act only whena certain degree of phenotypic variation is present. If there is a lack ofvariation, any adverse situation, such as a period of extreme cold or the arrivalof a group of predators, could terminate an entire population. In sucha homogeneous population, only genetic mutation could hopefully preservethe population. This happens as some mutants arise which are resistantto the unfavorable force.

In an artificial kidney, the patient's blood is passed through a system of very fine tubes bounded by thin membranes. The other side of the membrane is bathed by a dialysis fluid into which waste products can pass from the blood. The fine tubes con-verge into a tubing which then conducts the blood back into the patient's body through a vein. The fine tubes of the artificial kidney are made of cellophane.

The dialysis fluid which bathes the cellophane tubes is a salt solution with ionic concentrations similar to those of blood plasma. The function of the artificial kidney can be ex-plained by the principle of diffusion. Since the cel-lophane membrane is permeable to most small solutes, the concentrations of solutes in the blood, as it flows through the tubes, tend to equal those in the dialysis fluid. However, if there is an above normal level of a certain solute in the blood, this solute will diffuse out of the blood into the surrounding fluid, which has a lower concentration of the solute. In this way, waste products and other fluid substances in excess will leave the blood and pass into the dialysis fluid since their concentrations in the fluid are very low or non-existent.

If the original culture was indeed genetically pure (all the individuals having come from the same cell and thus having identical genotypes), there is no reason for any of the bacteria to exhibit different behavior or charac-teristics while remaining in the same environment. A change in phenotype could only be caused by a change in the genetic structure, in this case, a genetic mutation. In order to be absolutely sure that the change in color is indeed caused by a genetic mutation, we can test the permanence of the change. If there has been a change in genetic structure, it must necessarily be passed on to offspring of the cell with the original mutation. We can remove the white cells from the culture and grow them in a separate, identical medium. If they reproduce true- to-type, and produce a colony of only white bacteria, we can be sure that a mutation has indeed occurred. Of course there is always a possibility that back mutation will occur, with a reversion to red color, but this is very rare. It is important to note that while we know that UV radiation is a potential mutagen (agent inducing mutation), we cannot be entirely sure that all of the mutations resulted from UV rays. Some could have arisen as a result of a spontaneous change. Spontaneous muta-tions are chance occurrences, which are not caused by a specific external agent. The facts of the experiment, however, do fit well with what we know of the mechanisms of UV-induced mutations. Ultraviolet rays are theorized to affect the pyrimidines in DNA. They do this by (1) hydrolysing cytosine to a product that may cause mispairing, and (2) joining thymine molecules together to form dimers which block normal transcription from occur-ring. If such changes did occur, they would affect the production of substances that is coded for genetically. In this case, the gene product could have been a specific enzyme necessary for the production of red color. Its absence would account for the reversion to white color in the mutants. Of course an equally probable cause would be the production of an enzyme responsible for the whitecolor morphology in the mutants.", "ref_id": 1497, "meta_info": {"subject": "biology.csv", "src": "stemez-Biology", "question": "Live bacteria, all of which were red in color, were placed under an ultra-violet lamp.

The best way to determine if a given population is in equilibrium is to compare these frequencies of two generations to see if they are indeed constant. One way to do this is to determine the gene frequencies for a given adult population representative (or a group of that population) and for their offspring. Two generations are thus represented in the sample. For more reliable results, however, more generations should be compared with respect to their gene frequencies.

We know, that the rock has existed long enough for half of theoriginal amount of uranium to be converted into lead, or a total of 4.5 billionyears, which is equal to one half-life of uranium.

The lobster, for example, molts several times early in life, and at each molt it gets larger and resembles the adult more.

A soft, flexible, new cuticle is then deposited under the old one, with folds to allow for growth. At this point, the crustacean seeks a protected retreat or remains in its burrow. In order to rid itself of its old shell, a crustacean will take in enough water to swell its body up to three to four times its normal size. The resulting pressure which builds up on the old, rigid shell causes it to burst. The underlying new shell, how-ever, is pliable enough to accommodate the larger size.

Approximately 80 percent of all animal species belong to this phylum. The ClassInsecta, contain-ing more than 750,000 species, is the largest group of animals; in fact, it is larger than all other animal groups combined. The development of achitinousexoskeleton has been an important factor in the evolutionary success of the arthropods. Anexoskeletalplate covers each body segment, and movement is possible because the plates of each segment are joined by a flexible, thinarticularmembrane. In most arthropods, there has been a reduction in the total number of body segments, fusion of many segments, and se-condary subdivision of certain segments. This has re-sulted in body parts specialized for different functions, with movable joints between the parts.Infoldingof the embryonic ectoderm has also resulted in an internal skeleton, providing sites for muscle insertions. Arthropod musculature is complex, and quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The exoskeleton also lines both the anterior and posterior portions of the digestive tract. The exoskeleton is termed a cuticle and is composed of protein and chitin. The cuticle consists of anepicuticle, anexocuticle, and an endocuticle . The outermostepicuticleoften contains wax, as it does in insects, and serves to prevent water loss. Theexocuticleis tougher than the innermostendocuticle. Theepi-cuticleandexocuticleare absent at joints to provide for flexibility. The cuticle of the crustaceans is further strengthened by deposition of calcium salts. Where theepicuticleis absent, the cuticle is relatively perme-able to gas and water. Pine pore canals in the cuticle permit elimination of secretions from ducts. The support and locomotion provided by the elaborate exoskeleton are major advantages that arthropods have over all other in-vertebrates, and the ability for modification has enabled the cuticle to serve many functions. Another evolutionary advantage of the arthropods is the adaptation of well-developed organ systems. The digestive, respiratory, and blood vascular systems are all complex, and often show improvements over other in-vertebrates' systems. The reproductive structures are well developed in many arthropods.

Dormancy is terminated by the onset of colder temperatures\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nDormancy is a special condition of rest which enables an embryo to survive long periods of un-favorable environmental conditions, such as water scarcity or low temperature. During this period of rest, the embryo ceases or limits its growth, and metabolizes at very low levels, although ordinary plant rest can be termi-nated and normal growth resumed by the onset of warmer temperatures or the availability of water. Germination or the resumption of normal growth by a dormant embryo requires certain, very precise combinations of environ-mental cues. This is of great survival importance to the plant in that it prevents the dormant seed from germinating in response to conditions such as a warm spell in winter, which, although apparently favorable, are only temporary. Should the seed germinate during such a period, the seedling would begin to grow, only to be killed by the ensuing cold and frost. Apparently the dormant seed contains certain endogenous inhibiting factors which must be overcome before germination can begin, and thus requires more complex triggers then just a favorable temperature or water supply. Some seeds are required to pass through a period of cold before they are able to germinate. This is seen in the seeds of almost all plants growing in areas with marked seasonal variations. Many seeds require drying before they can germinate. Such a requirement has adaptive significance in that it prevents germination within the moist fruit of the parent plant. Some seeds such as those of the lettuce, require a light exposure, while the germination of others is inhibited by light. Certain seeds cannot germinate, even in highly favorable conditions of water, light, oxygen, and temperature, until they have been abraded by factors such as soil action. This abrasion wears away the seed coat, allowing water and oxygen to enter the seed and signal the initia-tion of germination. The seeds of some desert species germinate only when sufficient rainfall has drained inhibitory chemicals from their seed coats.

The seed is protected from freezing and desiccation by the seed coat and provided with nourishment by the endosperm. During germination, the embryo and endosperm absorb water and swell; then the seed coat ruptures, freeing the embryo and enabling it to resume development.

Interferon kills the virus directly\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nMany human diseases have a viral etiology (cause). Among the more common viral diseases are smallpox, chicken pox, mumps, measles, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, poliomyelitis, viral pneumo-nia, fever blisters (cold sores), and the common cold. Although most viral infections do not respond to treatment with many of the drugs effective against bacterial infection, many are preventable by means of vaccines. Buildup of an adequate supply of antibodies requires some time. During this period, extensive viral infection may occur. Most recov-eries from viral diseases occur before full development of the im-mune response (production of antibodies). A factor that is important in the recovery from a viral infection is interferon. Interferon is a protein produced by virus-infected cells, which spreads to uninfected cells and makes them more resistant to viral infection. Thus, exten-sive viral production and resultant tissue damage are prevented. Upon infection, the host cell is induced to synthesize interferon, which is then released into the extracellular fluid and affects the surrounding cells. It is thought that the interferon does not directly confer viral resistance to the uninfected cell, but induces formation of \"interferon\" ribosomes. Theseribosomesbind cellular mRNA normally, but do not bind viral mRNA effectively. This prevents synthesis of viral proteins which are essential for viral production. The interferon acts as a mediator or messenger from infected cells to uninfected cells, enabling the uninfected cells to synthesize products which prevent viral multiplication. Since interferon ulti-mately acts in the cytoplasm of the uninfected cell, viruses can en-ter the cell but cannot replicate and cause infection. Interferon produced by a cell infected with a particular virus can prevent healthy cells from becoming infected by almost all other types of viruses. Interferon is therefore not virus-specific. However, interferon produced by one host species is not effective if adminis-tered to a different species. It is therefore host species specific. Since interferon produced by birds and other mammals cannot be used in treating human beings, it is difficult to obtain large enough quantities of interferon to provide effective chemotherapy for viral diseases. (Human donors cannot provide the needed amount of interferon.) Interferon is a more rapid response to viral infection than anti-body response. Interferon production is initiated within hours after viral infection, reaching a maximum after two days. Within three or four days, interferon production declines as antibodies are produced. Prevention of viral infection by interferon production must be distinguished from another phenomenon-viral interference. Viral interference is observed when an initial viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell by a different virus. The initial virus somehow prevents reproduction of the second virus or inacti-vates receptors on the cell membrane (there are specific sites for vi-ral attachment).

The gene pool can be altered by environmental changes alone\nB. The gene pool can be altered by natural disasters only\nC.             The gene pool may be altered by factors such as mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive.\nD. The gene pool can be altered by genetic engineering only\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nThe total genetic material of a given population is termed the gene pool. The Hardy-Weinberg principle tells us that the relative gene frequencies within the gene pool of a population will remain constant from generation to generation unless certain factors alter the equilibrium of gene frequencies in the gene pool. Such factors include mutation, natural selection, migration, random genetic drift, and meiotic drive. Mutations can change one allele to another, such as A to a. If they are recurrent or \\textquotedblleftone-way,\\textquotedblright the relative frequencies of the two alleles will be changed by an increase in the proportion of a at the expense of A. Owing to the low mutation rate of most genes, such direct change in allelic frequency alone probably does not cause significant change in the gene pool. More important is the fact that mutations are a source of new genes, and thus traits, within a population. Together with sexual reproduction, which creates new combinations of existing genes, mutations provide the variation which is the basis for the operation of natural selection. Selection is the nonrandom differential retaining of favored genotypes. Unlike mutation, which operates directly on a gene to alter its frequency, selection indirectly alters a gene's frequency by acting on its carriers as a function of their ability to reproduce viable offspring. For example, if individuals carrying gene A are more successful in reproduction than individuals carrying gene B, the frequency of the former gene will tend to increase generation after generation at the expense of the latter. Any trait which gives an organism a better chance at survival in a given environment will increase that organism's ability to grow and reproduce, and it will increase the proportion of the gene for that trait in the gene pool. By the same token, any gene which confers a disadvantage to its carrier within its environment will decrease that organism's chances of survival to reproductive age and thus decrease the frequency of that gene in the gene pool. This is the principle underlying natural selection. Migration acts both directly and indirectly to alter gene frequencies. Directly, a population may receive alleles through immigration of individuals from a nearby population. The effectiveness of immigration in changing allelic frequencies is dependent on two factors: the difference in gene frequencies between the two populations, and the proportion of migrant genes that are incorporated. Alternatively, there can be emigration of members from a population which, depending on the size of the emigration and whether or not it is selective, can result in a change in allelic frequencies in the gene pool. Indirectly, migration acts as a source of variation, similar to mutation, upon which the forces of natural selection can operate. Migration can also enhance natural selection within a population by upsetting the equilibrium that may exist among the given genotypes in a population, concerning an advantage by sheer numbers to a given group. It can blur the effects of natural selection by replacing genes removed by selection. Allelic frequencies may fluctuate purely by chance about their mean from generation to generation. This is termed random genetic drift. Its effect on the gene pool of a large population is negligible, but in a small effectively interbreeding population, chance alteration inMendelianratios can have a significant effect on gene frequencies and may lead to the fixation of one allele and the loss of another. For example, isolated communities within a given population have been found to have different frequencies for blood group alleles than the population as a whole. Chance fluctuations in allelic frequency presumably caused these changes. Another factor that may alter allelic frequencies is meiotic drive. This is the term for preferential segregation of genes that may occur in meiosis. For example, if a particular chromosome is continually segregated to the polar body in femalegametogenesisits genes would tend to be excluded from the gene pool since the polar bodies are nonfunctional and will disintegrate.

First, some definitions: a) chromosomes: physical structures bearing genetic information (linear shaped in eukaryotes). b) gene: the part of a chromosome which codes for a certain hereditary trait. c) genotype: the genetic makeup of an organism, or the set of genes which it possesses. d) phenotype: the outward, visible expression of the hereditary constitution of an organism. e) homologous chromosomes: chromosomes bearing genes for the same characters. f) homozygote: an organism possessing an identical pair of alleles on homologous chromosomes for a given character or for all given characters. g) heterozygote: an organism possessing different alleles on homologous chromosomes for a given character or for all given characters. In solving genetic problems, one uses letters to represent the genotype of the organism. For example, a represents the gene for blue color and A represents the gene for red color. A capital letter is used for a dominant gene; that is, the phenotype of that gene will be expressed in a heterozygous state. For example, if the genotypeAais expressed as red, then A is the dominant gene. Small letter a represents the recessive gene; that is, one whose phenotype will be expressed only in the homozygous state. Therefore,aawould be expressed as blue. To solve a genetic problem, one writes down the genotypes of the two parents in the cross. Mendel's First Law tells us what to do. This law, also known as the Law of Independent Segregation, states that genes, the units of heredity, exist in individuals in pairs. In the formation of sex cells or gametes, the two genes separate and pass independent of one another into different gametes, so that each gamete has one, and only one, member of each pair. During fertilization, the gamete of one parent fuses with that of the other parent. Fusion brings the genes from each parent together, giving rise to offspring with paired genes. Now we will illustrate the Law of Segregation as it applies to the problem given. Let G represent the gene for green pod color and g represent the gene for yellow pod color. Since the parents come from pure lines, meaning that the two members of each gene pair are identical, we write the genotype of the parent plant with green pods as GG, and that of the parent plant with yellow pods asgg. Each gamete from the first parent will have one G and each gamete from the second will have one g. (Recall the Law of Independent Segregation.) Writing out a schematic cross, we have: P (Parent) GG \u00d7 gg Gametes formed G \\downarrow g F_1 (first filial) generation Gg The genotype of the F_1 generation is written asGgbecause it results from the fusion of the two gametes. We are told that all the F_1 generation from the above cross are green, and we observe that they are all heterozygous. Therefore G, which stands for the gene with green pods, must be dominant (by definition), and g, which stands for the gene with yellow pods, must be recessive. To determine the possible genotypes of the F_1 plants, or the second generation offspring, we mate two F_2 plants. The possible gametes derived from the parents are again obtained using Mendel's First Law. But now we obtain two types of gametes, G and g, from each parent, because either gene can come from the parental genotype ofGg. Schematically, then: P Gg \u00d7 Gg gametes G_1g \\downarrow G_1g It is easier to determine the F_2 generation using thePunnetsquare. The square is constructed as follows: possible gametes from female parent possible gametes from male parent G g \\rightarrow G GG Gg g Gg gg It gives all possible combinations of the parental gametes, so in F_2 we havegenotypically: 1 GG: 2Gg: 1gg Phenotypically: GG is homozygous dominant and green because G is dominant; Ggis heterozygous and green because G is dominant; and ggis homozygous recessive and yellow because g is recessive. It is important to note that we cannot observe the genotype itself because it lies in the constitution of the gene. Our observations come only from what we actually see, that is, the phenotypic difference. We know from thePunnetsquare that in the F_2 generation the ratio of homozygous dominant to the entire progeny is (1 / 4); the ratio of heterozygous is (2 / 4) or (1 / 2), and the ratio of homozygous recessive is (1 / 4). Therefore, the number of homozygous dominant (GG) plants is (1 / 4) \u00d7 580 or 145, the number of heterozygote (Gg) plants is (1 / 2) \u00d7 580 or 290 and the number of homozygous recessive (gg) plants is (1 / 4) \u00d7 580 or 145.

Since the parents come from pure lines, meaning that the two members of each gene pair are identical, we write the genotype of the parent plant with green pods as GG, and that of the parent plant with yellow pods asgg. Each gamete from the first parent will have one G and each gamete from the second will have one g. (Recall the Law of Independent Segregation.) Writing out a schematic cross, we have: P (Parent) GG \u00d7 gg Gametes formed G \\downarrow g F_1 (first filial) generation Gg The genotype of the F_1 generation is written asGgbecause it results from the fusion of the two gametes. We are told that all the F_1 generation from the above cross are green, and we observe that they are all heterozygous. Therefore G, which stands for the gene with green pods, must be dominant (by definition), and g, which stands for the gene with yellow pods, must be recessive. To determine the possible genotypes of the F_1 plants, or the second generation offspring, we mate two F_2 plants. The possible gametes derived from the parents are again obtained using Mendel's First Law. But now we obtain two types of gametes, G and g, from each parent, because either gene can come from the parental genotype ofGg. Schematically, then: P Gg \u00d7 Gg gametes G_1g \\downarrow G_1g It is easier to determine the F_2 generation using thePunnetsquare. The square is constructed as follows: possible gametes from female parent possible gametes from male parent G g \\rightarrow G GG Gg g Gg gg It gives all possible combinations of the parental gametes, so in F_2 we havegenotypically: 1 GG: 2Gg: 1gg Phenotypically: GG is homozygous dominant and green because G is dominant; Ggis heterozygous and green because G is dominant; and ggis homozygous recessive and yellow because g is recessive. It is important to note that we cannot observe the genotype itself because it lies in the constitution of the gene. Our observations come only from what we actually see, that is, the phenotypic difference. We know from thePunnetsquare that in the F_2 generation the ratio of homozygous dominant to the entire progeny is (1 / 4); the ratio of heterozygous is (2 / 4) or (1 / 2), and the ratio of homozygous recessive is (1 / 4). Therefore, the number of homozygous dominant (GG) plants is (1 / 4) \u00d7 580 or 145, the number of heterozygote (Gg) plants is (1 / 2) \u00d7 580 or 290 and the number of homozygous recessive (gg) plants is (1 / 4) \u00d7 580 or 145. When added together, they total 580, the number of F_2 plants."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nIn a group of students, about 36 percent could roll their tongues, a trait determined by a dominant gene.

We notice that there are two large groups (236, 253) which are approximately equal, and two small groups (50, 61) which are also nearly equal. We can reduce these numbers to small whole number ratios. gray body, normal wings (236 / 50) roughly equals 5 black body, vestigial wings (253 / 50) roughly equals 5 gray body, vestigial wings (61 / 50) roughly equals 1 black body, normal wings (50 / 50) roughly equals 1 Since the heterozygous F_2 parent (the result of a cross from two homozygous parents) is crossed with a double recessive, we would expect a 1:1:1:1 phenotypic ratio among the offspring. However, the ratio here is 5:5:1:1. This significant departure from the 1:1:1:1 ratio indicates that linkage is indeed likely. The fact that the ratio divides the progeny into four groups - two large and of equal size, and two small and of equal size - is also a typical result of a cross involving linked genes. To calculate the distance between the genes, we will have to rely on the fact that the frequency of crossing over depends on this distance. It is logical to assume that the farther apart two genes are on a chromosome, the more likely it is that a crossover will occur because there is a larger possible region in which it can occur. The process of locating genes on chromosomes is called mapping . The percentage of crossing over or recombination gives us no information about the absolute distances between the genes but it does give us relative distances between them. Suppose, for example, that genes A and B have a recombination frequency of 20 percent and genes A and C have a frequency of 40 percent. From this data, we cannot tell the exact distance of B from A or C from A, but, we can say that C must be twice as far from A as B is from A since twice as much crossing over occurred in the distance between C and A. Instead of having to compare two distances every time we want to refer to the separation of two genes, we have, by convention, established a standard measurement known as a map unit. A map unit is defined as the distance on the chromosome within which a crossover occurs one percent of the time. A map unit is also known as a \"Morgan,\\textquotedblright after Thomas H. Morgan.

When genes on a chromosome are allocated their respective positions on that chromosome, we can obtain what we call a genetic map.

Recombination frequency is defined as the ratio of the number of recombinants to the whole progeny, that is, recombination frequency (RF) = [(number of recombinants) / (total number of offspring in that generation containing the recombinants)] Because recombinants can only result from a crossover event, their numbers in the population will be small for closely linked genes. The recombinants in this problem are found in the two smaller groups, and their total is 50 + 61 or 111. The total number of progeny is 236 + 253 + 50 + 61 or 600. Therefore, RF = [(number of recombinants) / (total number of progeny)] = (111 / 600) = 0.185.

An isotonic contraction is when a muscle lengthens and an isometric contraction is when a muscle shortens\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nContraction refers to the active process of generating a force in a muscle. The force exerted by a contracting muscle on an object is known asthe muscle tension, and the force exerted on a muscle by the weight of anobject is known as the load. When a muscle shortens and lifts a load, themuscle contraction is said to be isotonic, since the load remains constantthroughout the period of shortening. When a load is greater than the muscle tension, shortening is prevented, and muscle length remains constant.

Blood flow is slowest in the arteries due to their smaller size.\nC.             The blood flow throughout the body is caused by the pressure difference that drives the blood through the vessel and the vascular resistance. The blood flow is slowest in the capillaries due to their greater total cross-sectional area.\nD. Blood flow is driven by the heart pumping blood.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nReference Solution:\nBlood flow is the quantity of blood that passes a given point in the circulation in a given period of time. It is usually expressed in milliliters or liters per minute. Blood flow through a blood vessel is determined by two factors: (1) the pressure difference that drives the blood through the vessel; and (2) the vascular resistance, or impedance to blood flow. These relations can be expressed mathematically: Flow = (\\Delta Pressure / Resistance) . As the pressure difference increases, flow increases; as the resistance increases, flow decreases. The pressure difference between the two ends of the vessel causes blood to flow from the high pressure end to the low pressure end. This pressure dif-ference or gradient is the essential factor which causes blood to flow. Although the heart acts to pump the blood, it is the pres-sure difference (about 140 nun Hg in the aorta and near 0 in the vena cava at the right atrium) that is critical for blood flow. The overall blood flow in the circulation of an adult is about 5 liters per minute. This is called the cardiac output because it is the amount pumped by each ventricle of the heart per unit time. The cardiac output is determined by multiplying the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by each ventricle during each beat (stroke volume): cardiac output = heart rate \u00d7 stroke volume. Normally the heart rate is about 70 beats per minute and the stroke volume is about 70 milli-liters per beat: CO = 70 (beats / min) \u00d7 70 (mls/ beat) = 4900 (mls/ min). The normal cardiac output is thus about 5 liters per minute. The rate of flow throughout the circulation is not constant. The rate is rapid in the arteries (about 30 centimeters per second) but falls as it moves through the arterioles. The rate is slowest in the capillaries but then increases again in thevenulesand veins. There is a physical explanation for this phenomenon. The velocity of blood flow in each type of blood vessel is inversely proportional to its total cross-sectional area. If any fluid passes from one tube to another of larger radius, the rate of flow is less in the larger tube. The rate is fastest in the aorta since it has the smallest total cross-sectional area of any vessel type (2.5 cm^2) The rate decreases in the arteries (20 cm^2) and decreases further in the arterioles (40 cm^2). The rate of flow decreases drastically in the capillaries which have a total cross-sectional area of 2500 cm^2 . Although the individual branches of the capillaries have a diameter much less than the aorta, their total cross-sectional area is much greater; therefore the rate in the capillaries is 1/1000 the rate in the aorta. The rate of flow increases in thevenules (250 cm^2) and increases further in the veins (80 cm^2).

The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nMost metabolic reactions are sensitive to the hydrogen ion concentration of the fluid in which they occur, due primarily to the marked influence of protons on enzyme function. Accordingly, the hydrogen concentration of the extracellular fluid is one of the most critically and delicately regulated chemical levels in the entire body. The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal. This regulation is achieved by exchanging hydrogen ions for sodium ions in the tubular fluid. Sodium ions usually combine with bicarbonate ions in the tubular fluid to form sodium bicarbonate. However, when excess hydrogen ions are secreted into the urine, they also combine with the bi-carbonate there, essentially replacing the sodium ions to form carbonic acid.

The decrease in the concentration of bicarbonate ions in the tubular fluid represents a net excretion of hydrogen ions. Usually the amount of hydrogen ions ex-changed for sodium in the distal convoluted tubules is equivalent to the amount of bicarbonate ions in the tubular fluid. If the plasma becomes very acidic, the quantity of bicarbonate ions in the kidney filtrate is insufficient to react with the abnormally high quantity of hydrogen ions. When this happens, the hydrogen ions combine with other buffers, in the tubular fluid, such as phosphate, and are excreted. If the extracellular fluids become too alkaline, the amount of bicarbonate in theglomerularfiltrate becomes greater than the amount of hydrogen ions secreted by the tubules. Theunreactedbicarbonate is simply ex-creted as sodium bicarbonate. The loss of sodium bi-carbonate makes the body fluid more acidic, returning the acid-base balance to normal. In addition to the bicarbonate technique, the kidney has another mechanism for coping with excessive acidity which involves the secretion of ammonia by the kidney tubules. Should the hydrogen ion concentration in the filtrate be too great for the bicarbonate to handle, ammonia would be secreted into the tubules. Here, the ammonia combines with hydrogen ions to produce ammonium ions (NH_4^+), which are then excreted.

The parathyroid hormone, called parathormone, regu-lates the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues. Production of this hormone is directly controlled by the calcium concentration of the extracellular fluid bathing the cells of these glands. Parathormone exerts at least the following four effects: (1) it increases gastrointestinal absorption of calcium by stimulating the active-transport system which moves calcium from the gut lumen into the blood; (2) it increases the movement of calcium and phosphate from bone into extracellular fluid. This is accomplished by stimulating osteoclasts to break down bone structure, thus liberating calcium phosphate into the blood. In this way, the store of calcium contained in bone is tapped; (3) it increases reabsorption of calcium by the renal tubules, thereby decreasing urinary calcium excretion; (4) it reduces the reabsorption of phosphate by the renal tubules.
