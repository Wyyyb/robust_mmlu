Interest rate system, Inflation targeting system, Monetary base system\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\n1) automatic systems; 2) discretionary systems; 3) systems with monetary rules. If monetary policy is used to balance a country's imports and exports it is basically an automatic system: the money supply increases when the exports surpass the imports and there is a surplus in the balance of payments and decreases when there is a deficit. When exports surpass the imports, the economy 'earns money'. This surplus on the balance of payments increases the bank reserves and so the money supply. The increase in the money supply increases real income and thereby stimu-lates the demand for imports, and increases the price level so that the exports become less competitive on the world markets and will be reduced by lack of demand for exports. The monetary ease will reduce the short term interest rates and stimulate investment in foreign en-terprises and the purchase of foreign securities, which are both types of imports. The consequence is a reduction in the surplus on the balance of payments = exports - imports. A deficit on the balance of payments would produce a reverse process. This automatic monetary system uses income and price movements to bal-ance the international payments and keep the exchange rate fixed. Ex-amples of countries which have used this automatic system in the past World War II period are Japan, France and West Germany. A second type of monetary system is the discretionary system as it is used, for example, in the United States, Monetary policy is used for goals other than controlling the balance of payments only, like full em-ployment, price stabilization and economic growth. This is made possible primarily by the execution of the open-market operations of purchasing and selling securities. A discretionary policy requires the use of targets because of the time lags of the impact of monetary policy on in-come, prices or the rate of growth. At present, targets related to the money stock, like 'reserves available for private deposits 1 are favored \"by the FED. In a discretionary system the targets may he changed. Un-der a discretionary system, fixed, flexible or 'pegged' exchange rate remains virtually fixed for long periods, long periods. A monetary system using rules is not yet existent. In such a system the discretion of the monetary authorities is replaced by a relatively precise rule that governs the monetary actions taken.

Explain.\n\nOptions:\nA.

A budget deficit is neutral if the government increases taxes\nC.             A budget deficit is neutral if the interest rates are high\nD. A budget deficit is neutral if the government decreases its expenditures\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nA budget deficit can be considered neutral with respect to monetary factors if, 1) the amount of financing by new money is just sufficient. To maintain the desired ratio of money balances to income at the new level. Some proportion of the budget ought always to be financed by monetary expan-sion since, if output is rising because of the stimulating fiscal policy, an increased quantity of money is required to keep the ratio M/y con-stant, where M is the money stock and y is national income. If this is not done then this ratio declines; the actual money balances become lower than the desired ones and people begin to spend less in order to hoard money; and the original stimulus of the budget deficit will be neutralized. When the money stock is too rapidly increased and becomes larger than the public wishes to hold, people will try to reduce their money balances by increasing expenditures, exerting an inflationary pres-sure on the economy. Only when the ratio M/y remains constant and M increases as rapidly as y - assuming there was monetary equilibrium in the beginning, is the fiscal policy in this respect neutral. A second condition for neutrality of the fiscal policy is that the amount of borrowing is exactly the amount that absorbs the gap which would otherwise exist between savings available for lending and the borrowing for private investment. Total withdrawals must equal total injections in equilibrium; thus, S + T = I + G where S = private savings; I = private investments; T = taxes; G = government expenditures. When there is a deficit, (government expenditures are larger than the tax revenues), G - T > 0; then, in equilibrium we see G - T = S - I > 0 so that the funds being borrowed for investments I are as much less as new funds available for lending S (savings). The budget deficit can be financed by selling bonds and by creat-ing new money. Hence, G - T = B + H, where B is bond sales and H is high-powered money.

To maintain the desired ratio of money balances to income at the new level. Some proportion of the budget ought always to be financed by monetary expan-sion since, if output is rising because of the stimulating fiscal policy, an increased quantity of money is required to keep the ratio M/y con-stant, where M is the money stock and y is national income. If this is not done then this ratio declines; the actual money balances become lower than the desired ones and people begin to spend less in order to hoard money; and the original stimulus of the budget deficit will be neutralized. When the money stock is too rapidly increased and becomes larger than the public wishes to hold, people will try to reduce their money balances by increasing expenditures, exerting an inflationary pres-sure on the economy. Only when the ratio M/y remains constant and M increases as rapidly as y - assuming there was monetary equilibrium in the beginning, is the fiscal policy in this respect neutral. A second condition for neutrality of the fiscal policy is that the amount of borrowing is exactly the amount that absorbs the gap which would otherwise exist between savings available for lending and the borrowing for private investment. Total withdrawals must equal total injections in equilibrium; thus, S + T = I + G where S = private savings; I = private investments; T = taxes; G = government expenditures. When there is a deficit, (government expenditures are larger than the tax revenues), G - T > 0; then, in equilibrium we see G - T = S - I > 0 so that the funds being borrowed for investments I are as much less as new funds available for lending S (savings). The budget deficit can be financed by selling bonds and by creat-ing new money. Hence, G - T = B + H, where B is bond sales and H is high-powered money. Thus, if the government finances its deficit only by borrowing B, for example, and it sells bonds, it can absorb precisely the excess savings that private investors are not using.

The value of final goods includes all the intermediate transactions involved in their production.\nB. The sale of intermediate goods can result in double counting and an exaggerated estimate of GNP.\nC.             Intermediate goods are not included in GNP because they are not final products.\nD. Final goods are more valuable than intermediate goods.\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nFirst of all, \"final goods\" means goods and ser-vices which are being purchased for final use and not for resale or further processing or manufacturing. Transactions involving intermediate goods, on the other hand, refer to purchases of goods and services for further processing and manufacturing or for resale. Now in the computation of GNP, the sale of final goods is included while the sale of inter-mediate goods is excluded, because the value of final goods includes all the intermediate transactions involved in their production. The inclusion of intermediate transactions would involve double counting and produce an exaggerated estimate of GNP. To clarify this point, take the following example. Suppose there are fivestages of production in having a suit manufactured and sold to a consumer who is the ultimate or final user. The following table lists the stages of produc-tion, sales value of materials or product, as well as the value added: (1) (2) (3) Stage of production Sales value of materials or product Value added Firm A, sheep ranch $ 40 $ 40 Firm B, wool processor $ 65 $ 25 Firm C, suit manufacturer $ 85 $20 Firm D, clothing wholesaler $110 $25 Firm E, retail clothier Total $160 $50 Total $460 $160 As the above table indicates, Firm A, a sheep ranch, provides $40 worth of wool to Firm B, a wool processor. Firm A pays out the $40 it receives in wages, rents, inter-est and profits. Firm B processes the wool and sells it to Firm C, a suit manufacturer, for $65. From this $65, $40 goes to Firm A, and the remaining $25 is used by B to pay wages, rents, interest, and profits for the resources need-ed in processing the wool. And so on: the manufacturer sells the suit to Firm D, a clothing wholesaler, who in turn sells it to Firm E, a retailer, and then, at last, it is bought for $160 by a consumer, the final user of the product. At each stage, the difference between what a firm has paid for the product and what it receives for its sale is paid out as wages, rent, interest, and profits for the resources used by that firm in helping to produce and distribute the suit. How much should be included in the GNP in accounting for the production of this suit? The answer is $160, because this figure includes all the intermediate transactions lead-ing up to the product's final sale. It would be a gross ex-aggeration to sum all the intermediate sales figures and the final sales value of the product and add the entire amount, $460, to GNP. This would be a serious case of double count-ing; that is, counting both the final product and the sale and resale of its various parts in the multistage productive process.

Transactions involving intermediate goods, on the other hand, refer to purchases of goods and services for further processing and manufacturing or for resale. Now in the computation of GNP, the sale of final goods is included while the sale of inter-mediate goods is excluded, because the value of final goods includes all the intermediate transactions involved in their production. The inclusion of intermediate transactions would involve double counting and produce an exaggerated estimate of GNP. To clarify this point, take the following example. Suppose there are fivestages of production in having a suit manufactured and sold to a consumer who is the ultimate or final user. The following table lists the stages of produc-tion, sales value of materials or product, as well as the value added: (1) (2) (3) Stage of production Sales value of materials or product Value added Firm A, sheep ranch $ 40 $ 40 Firm B, wool processor $ 65 $ 25 Firm C, suit manufacturer $ 85 $20 Firm D, clothing wholesaler $110 $25 Firm E, retail clothier Total $160 $50 Total $460 $160 As the above table indicates, Firm A, a sheep ranch, provides $40 worth of wool to Firm B, a wool processor. Firm A pays out the $40 it receives in wages, rents, inter-est and profits. Firm B processes the wool and sells it to Firm C, a suit manufacturer, for $65. From this $65, $40 goes to Firm A, and the remaining $25 is used by B to pay wages, rents, interest, and profits for the resources need-ed in processing the wool. And so on: the manufacturer sells the suit to Firm D, a clothing wholesaler, who in turn sells it to Firm E, a retailer, and then, at last, it is bought for $160 by a consumer, the final user of the product. At each stage, the difference between what a firm has paid for the product and what it receives for its sale is paid out as wages, rent, interest, and profits for the resources used by that firm in helping to produce and distribute the suit. How much should be included in the GNP in accounting for the production of this suit? The answer is $160, because this figure includes all the intermediate transactions lead-ing up to the product's final sale. It would be a gross ex-aggeration to sum all the intermediate sales figures and the final sales value of the product and add the entire amount, $460, to GNP. This would be a serious case of double count-ing; that is, counting both the final product and the sale and resale of its various parts in the multistage productive process. There is an alternative means of determining the $160 figure which is to be included in the GNP. This is the value-added method; that is, summing the value added to the total worth of the product at each step in the productive process.

Rule of 72 is a formula for calculating compound interest\nD. Rule of 72 is a banking rule for determining interest\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nIn dealing with populations, we often use the so-called \"rule of 72.\" It is used to approximate the doubling time of the population, or of interest. Suppose you estimate that the population of a country will grow at an annual rate of 6% for the next 25 years. To find out when the population will be double its present size, you could use a logarithm table or a calculator.

Consumption is $8,000 and $2,000 is saved\nD. Consumption is $10,000 and nothing is saved\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nThis question is asking for a linear consumption function, given the slopeof the line and a point on the line, from which the levels of consumption and saving at some given income level can be determined. Since the MPC is constant at 1/2, the consumption function is a straight linewith a slope of 1/2. This means that every time in-come is increased by 2 units, half of it, or 1 unit, goes towards more consumption. One point on theline is given, the break-even point, where Y = C = $8,000. The equationfor a simple linear consumption function is C =mY+ B, where m isthe slope of the line, or the MPC, and B is the level of consumption whenY = 0. It is given that m = MPC = 1/2, but B is not given. To find B, notethat the point Y = 8,000, and C = 8,000 is given as one point on the line. Since the formula for the line must hold true for all points on the line, thefollowing substitutions into the original equation must be true: 8000 = (1/2)(8000) + B = 4000 + B.

To eliminate the total number of unemployed engineers of 1,000,000, we must increase GNP by \\DeltaY = L_E \u00d7 [(\\DeltaY) / (\\DeltaL)]_E, so by the product of the engineering labor available and the reciprocal of the labor input ratio, called the (marginal) output/labor ratio. Thus in this case we must increase GNP by \\DeltaY= 1,000,000 \u00d7 [(1) / (20,000) = $50 billion to eliminate completely the unemployment of engineers. To eliminate the unemployment of secretaries, however, we have to increase GNP by only \\DeltaY= L_S \u00d7 [(\\DeltaY)/(\\DeltaL)]_S = 1,000,000 \u00d7 [(1) / (30,000)] = $ 33.33 billion so by $16.66 less. The reason is, of course, that the labor input ratio of the secretaries is higher, i.e., each increase of GNP of $1 billion employs 10,000 (= 30,000 - 20,000) more secretaries than engineers. The unemployment of engineers is more slowly reduced by an increase in GNP than the unemployment of secretaries. We can make the above calculations for! all five categories, to see by how much GNP must be increased to wipe out unemployment in each category. The results are displayed in the following table. Table 1 Engineers Secretaries Truckers Steel workers Farm workers \\DeltaY increase in GNP to eliminate structural unemployment (in $ billion) 50 33.33 40 66.66 200 From this table it is clear that the unemployment of the farm workers forms the real stumbling block: to eliminate this unemployment GNP is required to be increased by $200 billion. So, when GNP is increased by $200 billion, notonly are all the farm workers employed, but also all the steel workers, engineers, truckers and secretaries. However, because these other employment categories required less increase in GNP to close the GNP gap, in all these categories inflationary pressure results. The fiercest inflationary pressure will result from the secret-aries. Why? When GNP is increased by $200 billion and assuming fixed labor input ratios, the demand for secretaries will increase by \\DeltaL_S= \\DeltaY \u00d7 [(\\DeltaL) / (\\DeltaY)]_S = 200 \u00d7 30,000 = 6,000,000 persons. In the labor market there will be an excess demand of 6,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 5,000,000 secretaries. And employers will start to offer higher salaries to attract the scarcely available secretaries, thereby increasing the costs of production. This cost-push will be reflected in higher prices for goods and services, reducing the purchasing power of the dollar, i.e., reducing the real value of salaries and wages. This will also trigger off demands for higher wages and salaries in the neighboring sectors, andthe inflationary pressure spreads as quickly as a drop of oil a the inflationary pressure spreads as quickly as a drop of oil a water surface. The inflationary pressure will also be felt in the other labor categorieswhere excess demand appears. See the following table which where excess demand appears. See the following table which is constructed using the expression Table 2 --i Engineers Secretaries Truckers Steel workers Farm workers \\DeltaL_i -U_i Excess demand in category i resulting from \\DeltaY = $200 billion 3,000,000 5,000,000 4,000,000 2,000,000 0 \\DeltaL_i-U_i= \u00d7 [(\\DeltaL)/(\\DeltaY)]_i-U_i = 200 \u00d7 [(\\DeltaL)/(\\DeltaY)]_i- 1,000,000 where is\\DeltaL_ithe increase in the demand for labor in categoryi, (i= engineers, secretaries, truckers, steel and farm workers); (\\DeltaL/\\DeltaY)_iis the (marginal) labor-input ratio for labor categoryi;U_iis theis the particular i;U_iis the is the particular increase in GNP that is investigated; in this case \\DeltaY increase of $200 billion that eliminates the unemployment of the farm workers. This calculatory example is rather extreme, but it shows that if the labor-input ratios are rather fixed, for example, in-consequence of sticky salaries and wages, there is always a trade-off situation between unemployment and inflation on the aggregate macro--level. If we employ all the secretaries, requiring an increase in GNP of $33.33 billion, there will still be 1,000,000 - (33.33 \u00d7 20,000) = 333,333 engineers, 1,060,000 - (33.33 x 25,000) = 166,750 truckers, 500,050 steelworkers and 833,350 farm workers unemployed. Conversely, if we employ all the farm workers, unemployed. Conversely, if unemployed all the farm workers, requiring, as we have seen, an in-crease in GJP by $200 billion, a tremendous inflationary pressure is induced in all the other labor categories. The 'normal' situation, the parties lobbying Congress, will be that GNP will be increased somewhere in between $33,33 and $200 billion, say $50 billion. The resulting situation is indicated in the next table, which can be Table 2 --i Engineers Secretaries Truckers Steel workers Farm workers Inflationary Labor gap 0 500,000 250,000 Unemploy- ment 250,000 750,000 derived now easily using the preceding discussion.

The bank must lend an additional $30,000\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nIn lending an additional $50,000, the bank creates a deposit account of $50,000 in the name of the borrower, thus adding to its deposit liabilities (claims against the bank) by $50,000. The loan, being a future claim against the borrower, represents an asset to the bank. Thus the bank's balance sheet will show the following: Assets Liabilities Reserves$ 120,000 Deposits$ 500,000 Loans & Securities$ 380,000 Loans+$50,000 Deposits+$ 50,000 Total$ 550,000 Total$ 550,000 When the new borrower uses his loan by writing checks against his account, and the checks are presented to the bank for payment, the bank's balance sheet will again change. If the borrower has written checks for the entire $50,000 of the loan, then $50,000 will be deducted from his deposit account. Also, the bank will have to surrender $50,000 of its reserves to the payees or their banks. Thus, the balance sheet will change as follows: Assets Liabilities Reserves$ 120,000 Deposits$ 500,000 Loans & Securities$ 380,000 Loans+$50,000 Deposits+$ 50,000 Total$ 550,000 Total$550,000 Netting out all changes, then, the bank's balance sheet will come to look as follows: Assets Liabilities Reserves$ 70,000 Deposits$ 500,000 Loans & Securities$ 430,000 Total$ 550,000 Total$ 550,000 Note, however, that the amount of reserves required for $500,000 in deposit liabilities is $500,000 \u00d7 required re-serve ratio = $500,000 \u00d7 20% = $100,000.

Normal profits increase the number of firms in an industry, while economic profits decrease it\nB. A normal profit is the minimum reward required to induce entrepreneurs to utilize their skills, while an economic profit is any revenue over and above costs. Normal profit keeps the number of firms in the industry stable, while economic profits attract new firms into the industry.\nC.             Economic profit affects the number of firms in an industry, while normal profit does not\nD. Normal profit is the maximum profit a firm can make, while economic profit is the minimum\n\nAnswer: B\n\nReference Solution:\nA normal profit is the return to the entrepreneur for the functions he performsin organizing and combining the other resources in the productionof a commodity. The entrepreneurial resource must be paid for likeany other re-source. A normal profit is the minimum reward required to induceentrepreneurs to utilize their skills. An economic profit is any revenue over and above costs (including normalprofit). This additional profit usually accrues to the entrepreneur. Since this profit exceeds the amount needed to keep the entrepreneur in thefirm (normal profit), it is not considered a cost, but a pure or eco-nomic profit. In any industry, firms must be realizing normal profits in the long runto stay in business. When an industry is realizing normal profits, the num-ber of firms in theindustry will remain stable. Since firms are making normal profits, the entrepreneurswill be paid enough for their resource that they will not leavethe industry.

To solve this problem, first determine the changein Mr. Anderson's income and the resulting change in his consump-tion, and then apply the definition to obtain his MPC. The problem states that originally Mr. Anderson ex-pected to earn $20,000.Instead he earned $23,000.

Originally, Mr. Anderson was going to save $2,000 of his expected $20,000 income. Substituting these values into the equationgives: Y _planned = C _planned + S _planned 20,000 = C_p + 2,000 Which gives: C_p = 20,000 - 2,000 = 18,000 Thus, his originally planned consumption was $18,000.

The owners and controllers share a common goal of profit maximization but disagree on the distribution of corporate profits. Management prefers to reinvest profits in the firm while stockholders may want higher dividend payments.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nReference Solution:\nSince corporations are owned by such great num-bers of stockholders , in order to make smooth operation possible, a certain concentration of decision making power is inevitable. Were a general poll of stockholders neces-sary each time a decision is made, corporations would be so unwieldy that it is doubtful they would exist. This concentration at power is made possible by the fact that both owners and controllers share at least a fundamental goal - that of profit maximization. Directors of firms are able to maintain their position of power largely through the use of proxy voting. Annual meetings are rarely attended by all , or even a majority of stockholders. Those absent are requested by the directors to relinquish their votes to the directors to use as they see fit. In this way, directors amass largeblocsof votes and control the decision making process.

At the end of one year, that firm might be able to sell this same piece of equipment for only $8,000 on the open market. What has happened is that this equipment has worn out with usage of the year and its util-ity has decreased with the passage of time. Thus the mar-ket value of the asset has gone down by $2,000. We call this decrease in value depreciation. When a firm makes an investment in a capital good (such as our example above), tax laws typically permit the firm to deduct the cost of the asset over a period of time. The ra-tionale for this is as follows: Like the costs of other in-puts (labor, raw materials), outlays for capital goods re- present costs incurred by the firm in the productive process. Yet, a firm must still determine how much of the cost of using the capital good is borne during each year of its useful life. In theory, the firm would find the market price for the capital good at the beginning and end of each year and use the difference as a measure of depreciation. In practice, this is often impractical or impossible. The result is that the tax authorities turn to somewhat arbi-trary rules in instructing firms on evaluating depreciation. We shall see evidence of the arbitrary nature of deprecia-tion by examining two very different methods currently used. Before we examine these methods of depreciation, an understanding of how depreciation affects profits and taxes is needed. Suppose a firm has $20,000 income in its first year of operation before depreciation is accounted for and has capital assets worth $50,000. If this firm can somehow say that depreciation for the year is $20,000, its income after depreciation will be $0 and its taxes will be $0. If it can only claim $5,000 as depreciation, its taxable income will be $15,000. Of course, in the end, the amount of de-preciation deducted will be $50,000 (the value of the capi-tal goods). However it is important to realize that it is to the firm's advantage to postpone taxes as much as pos-sible, thereby giving it money to work with now. Therefore it is often to the firm's advantage to make large deprecia-tion deductions as quickly as possible, thereby reducing its tax burden. Suppose now we return to our asset which cost $10,000 and let us say that this asset has a useful life of 4 years with no value at the end of this 4-year period. In the straight-line method of depreciation, equal amounts of de-preciation expense are deducted during each year of the asset's useful life. To find this, we take the cost of the asset above, $10,000, and divide it by the useful life of 4 years to get an annual depreciation expense of $2,500. Under accelerated depreciation method, depreciation expenses are made larger during the early years of the as-set's life. One such method is called the \"sum-of-the- year's-digits\" method. With this approach, the useful life is first determined. Then the digits, starting with 1 and continuing to the useful life, are summed. In our example, the sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Then, to figure out the de-preciation expense for each year, we multiply the cost of the capital good by a fraction determined as follows: the denominator is the sum obtained above, 10. The numerator is a progressively smaller integer, starting with the lar-gest digit (i.e. the useful life) in year 1, the second largest digit (useful life - 1) in year 2, and so on until the numerator is 1 in the last year. In our example, we would have the following: Year Depreciation Expense 1 (4/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $4,000 2 (3/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $3,000 3 (2/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $2,000 4 (1/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $1,000 Looking at the different results for straight-line and sum-of-the- year's digits (SYD) depreciation, we see that in years 1 and 2, straight-line depreciation is less than SYD, while in years 3 and 4, straight-line is greater than SYD. Therefore, in years 1 and 2, taxable income will be greater under straight- line while in years 3 and 4, taxable income will be smaller. The effect of this is that under straight- line depreciation, taxes will be paid on profits sooner than under an accelerated method such as SYD. As shown earlier, it is often to the firm's advantage to postpone taxes to a later date. Therefore it is clear why many busi-ness firms approve of accelerated depreciation methods such as sum-of-the-year's- digits.", "ref_id": 2714, "meta_info": {"subject": "economics.csv", "src": "stemez-Economics", "question": "What is depreciation?

Suppose a firm has $20,000 income in its first year of operation before depreciation is accounted for and has capital assets worth $50,000. If this firm can somehow say that depreciation for the year is $20,000, its income after depreciation will be $0 and its taxes will be $0. If it can only claim $5,000 as depreciation, its taxable income will be $15,000. Of course, in the end, the amount of de-preciation deducted will be $50,000 (the value of the capi-tal goods). However it is important to realize that it is to the firm's advantage to postpone taxes as much as pos-sible, thereby giving it money to work with now. Therefore it is often to the firm's advantage to make large deprecia-tion deductions as quickly as possible, thereby reducing its tax burden. Suppose now we return to our asset which cost $10,000 and let us say that this asset has a useful life of 4 years with no value at the end of this 4-year period. In the straight-line method of depreciation, equal amounts of de-preciation expense are deducted during each year of the asset's useful life. To find this, we take the cost of the asset above, $10,000, and divide it by the useful life of 4 years to get an annual depreciation expense of $2,500. Under accelerated depreciation method, depreciation expenses are made larger during the early years of the as-set's life. One such method is called the \"sum-of-the- year's-digits\" method. With this approach, the useful life is first determined. Then the digits, starting with 1 and continuing to the useful life, are summed. In our example, the sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Then, to figure out the de-preciation expense for each year, we multiply the cost of the capital good by a fraction determined as follows: the denominator is the sum obtained above, 10. The numerator is a progressively smaller integer, starting with the lar-gest digit (i.e. the useful life) in year 1, the second largest digit (useful life - 1) in year 2, and so on until the numerator is 1 in the last year. In our example, we would have the following: Year Depreciation Expense 1 (4/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $4,000 2 (3/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $3,000 3 (2/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $2,000 4 (1/10) \u00d7 $10,000 = $1,000 Looking at the different results for straight-line and sum-of-the- year's digits (SYD) depreciation, we see that in years 1 and 2, straight-line depreciation is less than SYD, while in years 3 and 4, straight-line is greater than SYD. Therefore, in years 1 and 2, taxable income will be greater under straight- line while in years 3 and 4, taxable income will be smaller. The effect of this is that under straight- line depreciation, taxes will be paid on profits sooner than under an accelerated method such as SYD. As shown earlier, it is often to the firm's advantage to postpone taxes to a later date. Therefore it is clear why many busi-ness firms approve of accelerated depreciation methods such as sum-of-the-year's- digits."}, "question": "task_1"}}, {"data": {"text": "Question:\nSuppose that the price of bubble gum fell by a penny and the quantity demanded doubled while a one cent drop in the price of automobiles caused one additional car to be demanded.

Entrepreneurs register their preferences for the various types and quantitiesof capital goods, just as ordinary consumers register their preferencesfor differ-ent consumer goods. The entrepreneur, with profits and/orloans (he can borrow money from households by paying interest) registershis demands for various capital goods. If the entrepreneur wants toexpand his firm's business, or adopt a new technology, he can simply plowback more of his profits or borrow more money in order to register his preferencesfor capital goods more strongly. Capital goods will be supplied if the entrepreneurs are willing to pay asufficient price.

Capital goods are produced for producing other goods and services more efficiently, they are durable, are artifacts not a gift of nature, and can only be created through investment.

That is, capital goods, such as factories and machines, are not pro-duced to be directly consumed by consumers, but rather to produce consumer goods or other capital goods at a lower cost. We produce mechanical looms, for example, because much more cloth per unit of resource input can be woven with such machines than by hand weaving. Even when the cost of producing the looms is included, cloth is still produced at a far lower cost with the looms than without them. Capital is characterized by durability.

Capital goods are artifacts, not a gift of nature, as are labor and land - the other factors of production. While we frequently invest in labor by educating or training work-ers, and we invest in land by draining or irrigating for farming, much labor and land can be employed in production without extensive investment. Capital, by contrast, can only be created through investment, which is defined as the pur-chase of capital goods. As an aid to production, it has the following weaknesses: The first is a time problem. Capital goods must be bought in advance of the production of consumer goods and services. For example, an investment in a factory building today may not begin to pay off for several years. Second, there may be substantial risk involved, since the use of capital goods is envisioned for the future. For example, a machine that a businessman planned to use for twenty years may turn out to be obsolete after only two years because a new and more efficient machine has been in-vented.

Every day it purchases a few hundred gallons, from large producers, which it pours directly into the vat. This vat represents our beverage company's inven-tory. Now when it makes a sale, it does not know on which day it bought the goods it is selling since all the inven-tory is blended together.

In this case, it is impossible to discriminate between different purchases. In most cases, it is not impossible but highly impractical. Therefore methods such as LIFO and FIFO have been devised. FIFO, the first-in, first-out method of costing inven-tory is based on the assumption that when a sale is made, the unit of inventory which has been on hand the longest should be used to evaluate cost.

In this case LIFO is justified. The ways in which LIFO and FIFO affect taxes depend upon the way prices are moving. In the United States, ris-ing prices have become the norm, so we will assume that costs are rising over time. If costs are rising, FIFO will evaluate costs at a lower level than LIFO.

With such a situation, the wise businessman would choose LIFO so as to minimize taxes. However, it is a dif-ferent story when reporting to the stockholders.

Macroeconomic models are precise representations of individual interactions\nD. The relationships between aggregate economic variables are strictly deterministic\n\nAnswer: A\n\nReference Solution:\nMacromodelsof the economy are macroeconomic simplifications of the economy: they work directly on the relationship between aggregates, such as National Income, Consumption, Investment, Money Supply, Government Expendi-tures, Taxes, Exports and Imports and they take no account of individuals. A macro-economic model represents the economy. The key-word here is 'represents'; amacromodeldoes not precisely describe or explain the interactions of the millions of individuals living and working together, but it tries to represent the aggregate effect of those millions of interactions. Individuals behave somewhat erratically, but whole cities, regions, or nations show more stable behavior. Whole cities, regions or nations can well be represented by a machine-like model for many purposes. This may be illustrated by the example of incoming and outgoing highways of New York City. Although the behavior of the millions of individuals, the Smiths, the Jones, the Carters, is unpredictable- -we don't know if a particular individual drives his car to or out of New York City at a particular hour- -we can with a fair amount of precision predict the total number of cars that will enter or leave New York City over the highways at particular hours of certain days. Traffic statistics are compiled over the course of the year, and on the basis of these we can predict the in-and outgoing traffic flows on certain holidays, and the traffic flows in various hours- -for example, before, during, and after the rush hours- -of the day. The variety of cars and drivers is enormous, but when the focus is on the number of vehicles alone, an aggregate number for these flows per hour may be found. These traffic flows can also be related to particular events- -office hours, holi-days, the weather- -and the flows can be explained by these 'macro' events that affect millions of individuals simul-taneously. In the same fashion, statistics on economic aggregates can be compiled and related to each other and to outside events that affect the economy as a whole. Still, the economy does not work as a machine because all these individuals form their own decisions, sometimes with surprising results.

A macro-economic model represents the economy. The key-word here is 'represents'; amacromodeldoes not precisely describe or explain the interactions of the millions of individuals living and working together, but it tries to represent the aggregate effect of those millions of interactions. Individuals behave somewhat erratically, but whole cities, regions, or nations show more stable behavior. Whole cities, regions or nations can well be represented by a machine-like model for many purposes. This may be illustrated by the example of incoming and outgoing highways of New York City. Although the behavior of the millions of individuals, the Smiths, the Jones, the Carters, is unpredictable- -we don't know if a particular individual drives his car to or out of New York City at a particular hour- -we can with a fair amount of precision predict the total number of cars that will enter or leave New York City over the highways at particular hours of certain days. Traffic statistics are compiled over the course of the year, and on the basis of these we can predict the in-and outgoing traffic flows on certain holidays, and the traffic flows in various hours- -for example, before, during, and after the rush hours- -of the day. The variety of cars and drivers is enormous, but when the focus is on the number of vehicles alone, an aggregate number for these flows per hour may be found. These traffic flows can also be related to particular events- -office hours, holi-days, the weather- -and the flows can be explained by these 'macro' events that affect millions of individuals simul-taneously. In the same fashion, statistics on economic aggregates can be compiled and related to each other and to outside events that affect the economy as a whole. Still, the economy does not work as a machine because all these individuals form their own decisions, sometimes with surprising results. The relationships between the aggregate economic variables are not mechanistic, but probabilistic. The aggregate relationships described by a macroeconomic model are relatively stable, because the ecc-entricities in the behavior of the individuals comprising the economy are independent of each other.
