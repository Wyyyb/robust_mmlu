Given a multiple-choice question, its options, and the correct answer, generate six additional distractors (options) that are plausible but incorrect. These distractors should be relevant to the subject matter of the question but should not be the correct answer or too similar to it. The question may include images, but you do not need to know what the content of the image is. Focus your attention on the textual information.
