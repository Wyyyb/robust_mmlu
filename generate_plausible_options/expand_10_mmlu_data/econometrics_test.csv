"Suppose that 100 separate firms were tested to determine how many of them ""beat the market"" using a Jensen-type regression, and it is found that 3 fund managers significantly do so. Does this suggest prima facie evidence for stock market inefficiency?",The results would be different if a different type of regression was used,"This suggests evidence for stock market efficiency, not inefficiency",Yes,"In order to answer this question, you would need to test every fund manager trading in that market",There is insufficient information given in the question to draw a conclusion about market efficiency.,No,The results are inconclusive without knowing the performance of the market as a whole,It's impossible to draw conclusions based on the performance of only 100 firms,This indicates that the majority of fund managers do not significantly beat the market,This suggests that only a small percentage of fund managers can beat the market,F
