 The change in q in the first generation is given by the equation $Δq = u \cdot p - v \cdot q$, where $p$ is the initial frequency of $D$. We have $p = 0.8$ and $q = 0.2$. The change in $q$ is $Δq = 4.1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 0.8 - 2.5 \times 10^{-7} \cdot 0.2 = 0.00003275$. The answer to (a) is (A). At mutational equilibrium, the rate of change of $q$ is zero, so $u \cdot p - v \cdot q = 0$. Solving for $q$, we get $q = \frac{u \cdot p}{v + u} = \frac{4.1 \times 10^{-5} \cdot 0.8}{2.5 \times 10^{-7} + 4.1 \times 10^{-5}} = 0.9939$. The answer to (b) is (A).

 Convergent evolution is the process by which different species, lineages, or organisms evolve similar traits or characteristics in response to similar environmental pressures or selection forces. The gills of a fish and the lungs of a human are both respiratory organs that have evolved to extract oxygen from the environment, but they are very different in terms of their structure and function. The leaves of an oak tree and the spines of a cactus are both adaptations to conserve water, but they are very different in terms of their structure and function. The eyes of a human and the eyes of a squid are both sensory organs that have evolved to detect light, but they are very different in terms of their structure and function. The roots of a tree and the legs of an animal are both structural elements that have evolved to support the organism, but they are very different in terms of their structure and function. The presence of a notochord in all chordate embryos is an example of homology, not convergent evolution. The beak of a bird and the teeth of a mammal are both adaptations to eat, but they are very different in terms of their structure and function.

 The frequency of the recessive allele (d) is $q = \frac{90}{1000} = 0.09$. The frequency of the dominant allele (D) is $p = 1 - q = 0.91$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.09 \cdot 0.91 = 0.1642$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.1642 * 1000 = 164.2$. So we end up with 164.2 heterozygous individuals. The number of phenotypically normal women is equal to the number of heterozygous individuals, or 164.2. The percentage of the women who are phenotypically normal is $\frac{164.2}{1000} * 100 = 16.42$. The answer is not among the options. The answer is approximately 16.42 percent.

 In humans, the sex of an individual is determined by the presence of either an X and an X chromosome (female) or an X and a Y chromosome (male). The presence of two X chromosomes in the absence of a Y chromosome has no impact on the sex of an individual, so (A) is incorrect. The number of autosomes does not determine the sex of an individual, so (B) is incorrect. The sex of an individual is determined by the number of X chromosomes, and the presence of a Y chromosome, so (C) is incorrect. The combination of two Y chromosomes does not determine that an individual will be female, so (D) is incorrect. The presence of an X chromosome and an additional chromosome other than Y does not determine that an individual will be male, so (E) is incorrect. Environmental factors do not determine the genetic sex of an individual, so (F) is incorrect. The presence of the X chromosome does not determine that an individual will be male, so (G) is incorrect.

 The relative occupancy of the α and β spin energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann distribution is given by $N_{\alpha} / N_{\beta} = e^{-\Delta E / kT}$. The energy difference between the α and β spin levels is given by $g \mu_{B} B$. The relative occupancy is therefore $N_{\alpha} / N_{\beta} = e^{-g \mu_{B} B / kT}$. The g-value is given as 2.05, and the frequencies are given as L-band and W-band. The L-band frequency is 1.0 GHz, and the W-band frequency is 95 GHz. The magnetic field strength is given by $B = \mu_{0} H = \mu_{0} \frac{B_{0}}{2 \pi}$. The magnetic field strength is therefore 0.0335 T at L-band and 3.35 T at W-band.

 The probability of finding the electron in a given region is equal to the square of the absolute value of the wave function in that region. The wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional box is given by $\psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)$. The probability density is given by $P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2 \left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right)$. The probability of finding the electron in the region $0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2} L$ is equal to the integral of the probability density over this region. This is equal to $\int_{0}^{L/2} P(x) dx = \int_{0}^{L/2} \frac{2}{L} \sin^2 \left( \frac{\pi x}{L} \right) dx$.

The energy of the photon is given by $E = hc/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. The energy of the photon is $E = hc/\lambda = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~s})(3.0 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1})/(58.4 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}) = 3.39 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$.

 The energy of the lowest energy level is $3.00 \mathrm{eV}$ above the bottom of the well. The energy of the bottom of the well is $20.00 \mathrm{eV}$, so the energy of the lowest energy level is $20.00 \mathrm{eV} - 3.00 \mathrm{eV} = 17.00 \mathrm{eV}$. The width of the well is the distance between the bottom of the well and the lowest energy level. The width of the well is therefore $17.00 \mathrm{eV} / 2 = 8.50 \mathrm{eV}$. The width of the well is also the distance between the points where the potential is zero. The width of the well is therefore $8.50 \mathrm{eV} / 1.00 \mathrm{eV} / \mathrm{nm} = 8.50 \mathrm{nm}$.

 The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break the bond. The bond dissociation energy is equal to the difference between the energy of the molecule and the sum of the energies of the atoms. The energy of the molecule is $D_0$, and the energy of the atoms is $2 \cdot E_{H}$, where $E_H$ is the energy of a hydrogen atom. Therefore, $\Delta H_0^{\circ} = D_0 - 2 \cdot E_H$. We are given $D_0 = 4.4781 \mathrm{eV}$. We need to convert this to $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. $1 \mathrm{eV} = 96.485 \mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$, so $D_0 = 4.4781 \cdot 96.485 = 434.15 \mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{mol}$. The energy of a hydrogen atom is $E_H = 13.598 \mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, $\Delta H_0^{\circ} = 434.15 - 2 \cdot 13.598 = 407.19 \mathrm{kJ

 The change in internal energy is equal to the work done by the system, which is equal to the negative of the work done on the system. The work done on the system is equal to the integral of the pressure with respect to the volume. The pressure is equal to the external pressure, which is 1 atm, and the volume is equal to the initial volume minus the final volume. The initial volume is equal to the cross-sectional area times the initial piston position, which is $10.0 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \times 20 \mathrm{~cm} = 200 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. The final volume is equal to the cross-sectional area times the final piston position, which is $10.0 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \times 40 \mathrm{~cm} = 400 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

 The rate of leakage is proportional to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the balloon. The pressure difference is the same for both balloons, so the rate of leakage is proportional to the mass of gas inside the balloon. The oxygen balloon leaks at a rate of 1 atm in 1 hour, so the rate of leakage is 1 atm/h. The hydrogen balloon has a mass of 1 kg, which is 1/16 the mass of the oxygen balloon. Therefore the rate of leakage for the hydrogen balloon is 1/16 times the rate of leakage for the oxygen balloon, or 1/16 atm/h. The time it takes for the hydrogen balloon to leak to 1/2 atm is therefore 1/2 / (1/16) = 8 hours. The answer is not among the options, but the correct answer is 8 hours.

We are asked to calculate the mean free path for oxygen at 1 atm and $10^{-3}$ torr. The Boltzmann constant is $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/K$. The molar mass of oxygen is $M = 32 g/mol$.

First we need to convert $T_c$ to Kelvin. $T_c = 200°C + 273.15 = 473.15K$. Then we can use the vanderWaals equation to solve for $b$. $P_c = \frac{RT_c}{V_c - b} - a/V_c^{2}$. We are given that $P_c = 30atm$, so we can solve for $b$. $30 = \frac{R \cdot 473.15}{V_c - b} - a/V_c^{2}$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $b$. $b = V_c - \frac{30R}{473.15}V_c^{2} + a/V_c^{2}$. We are given that $P_c = 30atm$, so we can solve for $b$. $b = V_c - \frac{30R}{473.15

 The process is adiabatic and reversible, so the internal energy is constant. The work done is equal to the change in volume times the pressure. The pressure is constant, so the work done is equal to the change in volume times the initial pressure. The change in volume is $75 - 20 = 55$ liters. The initial volume is 75 liters, so the initial pressure is $P_{1} = \frac{nRT}{V_{1}} = \frac{2 \times 0.08206 \times 318}{75} = 0.823$ atm. The final volume is 20 liters, so the final pressure is $P_{2} = \frac{nRT}{V_{2}} = \frac{2 \times 0.08206 \times 318}{20} = 2.621$ atm. The work done is therefore $W = P_{1}V_{1} - P_{2}V_{2} = 0.823 \times 75 - 2.621 \times 20 = 61.68 - 52.42 = 9.26$ J. The heat added is equal to the work done, so $q = 9.

 The Coulombic barrier is the energy required to overcome the repulsive force between the positively charged alpha particle and the positively charged nucleus of the target. The Coulombic barrier is given by the equation $E_{C} = 
frac{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}}{4 \pi \epsilon_{0} r}$. Here, $Z_{1}$ is the charge of the alpha particle, $Z_{2}$ is the charge of the target nucleus, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of free space, and $r$ is the distance between the centers of the alpha particle and the target nucleus. The charge of the alpha particle is $+2e$, and the charge of the ^209Bi nucleus is $+83e$.

 We are given that the initial volume is 500 ml, or 0.500 L, and the initial pressure is 2.00 atm. We are asked to find the volume when the pressure is changed to each of the following: 4.00 atm, 760 torr, and 1.8 × 10^-3 torr. We can use the ideal gas equation to solve this problem. $PV = nRT$. We are given that the temperature is constant, so we can write $P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}$. We can solve for $V_{2}$ by dividing both sides by $P_{2}$. (a) $P_{2} = 4.00$ atm, $V_{2} = \frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{P_{2}} = \frac{(2.00)(0.500)}{4.00} = 0.25 L$. (b) $P_{2} = 760$ torr, $V_{2} = \frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{P_{2}} = \frac{(2.00)(0.500)}{760}

 The Lyman series is a series of spectral lines that are emitted by hydrogen when an electron jumps from a higher energy level to the first energy level. The series limit is the shortest wavelength in this series. The energy of the photon is given by the equation $E = hc/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. The energy of the photon is also given by the equation $E = E_{i} - E_{f}$, where $E_{i}$ is the energy of the initial state and $E_{f}$ is the energy of the final state.

 The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy changes of the two copper blocks. The entropy change of a system is given by the formula $\Delta S = \int \frac{dQ}{T}$. The heat transferred to the system is given by $Q = mc \Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the system, $c$ is the specific heat capacity, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. Therefore, the entropy change of the first block is $\Delta S_1 = \int \frac{dQ}{T} = \int \frac{m c \Delta T}{T} = m c \int \frac{\Delta T}{T} = m c \ln \frac{T_2}{T_1}$.

 First we need to find the number of moles of acid in the 10 cc of battery acid. The density of the acid is 1.21 g/cm3, so the mass of the acid is 10 * 1.21 = 12.1 g. The molar mass of the acid is 98 g/mol, so the number of moles of acid is 12.1 / 98 = 0.1235 mol. The acid is diluted to 100 cc, so the concentration of the acid is 0.1235 / 100 = 0.001235 mol/cm3. The acid is then neutralized by 45 cc of 0.5 N base, which means that 0.0225 mol of base is added. The acid is completely neutralized, so the number of moles of acid remaining is 0.1235 - 0.0225 = 0.101 mol. The normality of the diluted acid is therefore 0.101 / 100 = 0.00101 N. The strength of the diluted acid in g/l is 0.1235 * 1000 / 100 = 1.235 g/l. The strength of the undiluted acid

First, we need to convert the volume from $\mathrm{dm}^3$ to $\mathrm{cm}^3$. $1 \mathrm{dm}^3 = 1000 \mathrm{cm}^3$, so $20.000 \mathrm{dm}^3 = 20,000 \mathrm{cm}^3$. The pressure is given in $\mathrm{cm}$ of water, so we need to convert this to $\mathrm{Pa}$. The density of water is $0.99707 \mathrm{g} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, so the mass of water in the manometer is $206.402 \mathrm{cm} \cdot 0.99707 \mathrm{g} \mathrm{cm}^{-3} = 206.402 \mathrm{g}$. The pressure is then $206.402 \mathrm{g} \cdot 9.807 \mathrm{N} \mathrm{kg}^{-1} \mathrm{g}^{-1} = 2033.4 \mathrm{Pa}$. The mass

 First we need to find the weight of H_2SO_4 in 1000 ml of the solution. The density of the solution is 1.8 g/ml, so the total weight of the solution is 1000 ml * 1.8 g/ml = 1800 g. The solution is 90% H_2SO_4 by weight, so the weight of H_2SO_4 is 0.9 * 1800 g = 1620 g. The molarity of the solution is the number of moles of H_2SO_4 per liter of solution. The molar mass of H_2SO_4 is 98.08 g/mol, so the number of moles of H_2SO_4 in 1620 g is 1620 g / 98.08 g/mol = 16.5 mol. The molarity is therefore 16.5 mol/L. The normality of the solution is the number of equivalents of H_2SO_4 per liter of solution. The number of equivalents of H_2SO_4 is the number of moles of H_2SO_4, which is 16.5 mol.

 The vapour pressure of the solution is lower than that of the pure solvent because the non-volatile compound is dissolved in the solvent. The amount of the compound dissolved is $19.0 \mathrm{~g}$, and the amount of solvent is $500 \mathrm{~g}$. The mole fraction of the compound is therefore $\frac{19.0}{500+19.0} = \frac{19.0}{519.0}$. The mole fraction of the solvent is $1 - \frac{19.0}{519.0} = \frac{500}{519.0}$. The vapour pressure of the solution is $51.5 \mathrm{kPa}$, and the vapour pressure of the pure solvent is $53.3 \mathrm{kPa}$. The change in vapour pressure is therefore $53.3 - 51.5 = 1.8 \mathrm{kPa}$. The change in vapour pressure is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent times the vapour pressure of the pure solvent times the change in vapour pressure. Therefore, $\frac{500}{519.0} \cdot 53.3 \cdot 1.8 = 19.0 \cdot x$,

The molarity of ethanol is the number of moles of ethanol per liter of solution. The number of moles of ethanol is 720 / 46 = 15.65. The molarity is 15.65 / 0.9 = 17.43 M. The answer is not among the options. The answer is 17.43 M.

 Charles's law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Therefore, we can write the equation $V_{1} / T_{1} = V_{2} / T_{2}$.

We can solve for $T_{1}$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $T_{1} T_{2}$ and then subtracting $V_{1} T_{2}$ from both sides. This gives us $V_{1} T_{2} - V_{1} T_{2} = V_{2} T_{1} - V_{1} T_{2}$, which simplifies to $V_{2} T_{1} = V_{1} T_{2}$. We can then substitute the given values into this equation to find $T_{1}$. $T_{1} = \frac{V_{1} T_{2}}{

 The equilibrium constant, K_p, is given by the equation $K_{p} = \frac{[SO_{2}][Cl_{2}]}{[SO_{2}Cl_{2}]}$. We are given that the degree of dissociation is .121, which means that $[SO_{2}] = .121[SO_{2}Cl_{2}]$ and $[Cl_{2}] = .121[SO_{2}Cl_{2}]$. Therefore, $K_{p} = \frac{(.121)^{2}[SO_{2}Cl_{2}]}{[SO_{2}Cl_{2}]} = (.121)^{2} = 1.49 \times 10^{-2}$.

 The ideal gas equation is $PV = nRT$. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature is constant, and the gas is ideal, the equation becomes $P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2}$. We are given that $P_{1} = 1$ atm, $n = 2$ moles, and $P_{2}$ is unknown. We are also given that the heat absorbed is 750 cal, which is equal to $750 \times 4.184 = 3134.4$ J. The heat absorbed is equal to the change in internal energy, which is equal to $Q = \Delta U = nC_{v} \Delta T$. Since the process is isothermal, $\Delta T = 0$, and therefore $Q = 0$. The work done during the process is equal to $W = P_{2}V_{2} - P_{1}V_{1} = P_{2}V_{2} - 1$. The work done is equal to the heat absorbed, and therefore $P_{2}V_{2} - 1 = 0$.

 We are given that the mole fraction of ammonia is 10%, which means that the mole fraction of the other two gases is 90%. The mole fraction of hydrogen is 60%, and the mole fraction of nitrogen is 30%. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the three gases. The partial pressure of ammonia is $P_{NH_3} = x_{NH_3}P_{total} = 0.1P_{total}$. The partial pressure of hydrogen is $P_{H_2} = x_{H_2}P_{total} = 0.6P_{total}$. The partial pressure of nitrogen is $P_{N_2} = x_{N_2}P_{total} = 0.3P_{total}$.

The volume of a face-centred cubic lattice is $V = \frac{a^{3}}{4}$, where $a$ is the length of the side of the cube.

The amount of proton charge within the sphere of radius $r$ is $Q = 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3 / 3$. The perturbation is therefore $-e Q / 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r = -e \cdot 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^3 / 3 / 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r = -e r^2 / 3$. The perturbation is proportional to $r^2$, so the perturbation is largest at the nucleus.

The rule states that if the limit of the numerator and denominator both approach zero, then we can differentiate both the numerator and denominator and evaluate the limit again. In this case, we have $$\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\ln (1+x)-x}{x^2} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{1+x}-1}{2x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{-x}{2x(1+x)} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{-1}{2(1+x)} = \frac{-1}{2}.$$ Alternatively, we can form a Taylor expansion of both the numerator and denominator. The Taylor expansion of $\ln (1+x)$ is $$\ln (1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots$$ and the Taylor expansion of $x$ is $$x = x.$$ Therefore, we have $$\frac{\ln (1+x)-x}{x^2} = \frac{\left(x - \frac{x^2}{2

 The fugacity coefficient is defined as the ratio of the fugacity to the pressure. The fugacity is given by the equation $f = p \phi$, where $\phi$ is the fugacity coefficient. The equation of state given is $p V_{\mathrm{m}}=R T\left(1+B / V_{\mathrm{m}}+C / V_{\mathrm{m}}^2\right)$. We can rearrange this to get $p = R T / V_{\mathrm{m}} - B / V_{\mathrm{m}}^2 - C / V_{\mathrm{m}}^3$. Then we can substitute this into the equation for the fugacity coefficient to get $\phi = 1 - B / V_{\mathrm{m}} - C / V_{\mathrm{m}}^2$. The fugacity is then $f = p \phi = p\left(1 - B / V_{\mathrm{m}} - C / V_{\mathrm{m}}^2\right)$. The fugacity coefficient is then $\phi = 1 - B / V_{\mathrm{m}} - C / V_{\mathrm{m}}^2$. The fug

 The pressure of a gas is given by the ideal gas law, $p = \rho R T$. The density of the gas is given by $\rho = \frac{M}{RT}$. The change in pressure is given by $\mathrm{d} p = -\rho g \mathrm{~d} h$. We can substitute for $\rho$ to get $\mathrm{d} p = -\frac{M g}{RT} \mathrm{~d} h$. The pressure difference between the top and bottom of the vessel is given by $\Delta p = \int_{0}^{15} \mathrm{d} p = -\frac{M g}{RT} \int_{0}^{15} \mathrm{~d} h = -\frac{M g}{RT} \cdot 15$.

 The equilibrium concentration of oxygen gas in water is given by Henry's law, which states that the concentration of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The concentration of oxygen gas in water is therefore equal to the partial pressure of oxygen gas in air, divided by the Henry's law constant. The partial pressure of oxygen gas in air is given by the mole fraction of oxygen gas in air, multiplied by the total pressure of the air. The mole fraction of oxygen gas in air is 0.2095, and the total pressure of the air is 760 torr. Therefore the partial pressure of oxygen gas in air is 0.2095 × 760 = 159.3 torr. The concentration of oxygen gas in water is therefore equal to 159.3 torr / (3.30 × 10^7 torrs) = 4.83 × 10^-5 M. The molarity of oxygen gas in water is therefore 4.83 × 10^-5 M. The molarity of oxygen gas in water is equal to the number of moles of oxygen gas per liter of water. The number of moles of oxygen gas per liter of water is equal to the molarity of oxygen gas

We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve this problem. $pH = pK_{a} + log \left(\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\right)$. We are given that the pH is equal to 7, so we can solve for [H+]. $7 = -10 + log \left(\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\right)$. We can solve for [H+] by using the Ka expression. $K_{a} = \frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$.

 We are given that 2200 kg of Aerozine50 were consumed. We are also given the molecular weights of the compounds involved. We are asked to find the amount of water produced. We can do this by first finding the number of moles of Aerozine50 consumed. We can do this by dividing the mass of Aerozine50 by its molecular weight. The molecular weight of Aerozine50 is 50% hydrazine and 50% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine. The molecular weight of hydrazine is 32.0 g/mole and the molecular weight of unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine is 60.0 g/mole.

 The entropy of a discrete random variable X is given by the formula $H(X) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$, where $p(x)$ is the probability mass function of X. Since X is non-negative integer-valued, we can write $p(x) = P(X = x) = \frac{1}{1+x}$, since the expected value of X is 1. Then, we can compute the entropy as follows:
\begin{align*}
H(X) &= -\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x} \log_2 \frac{1}{1+x} \\
&= -\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} \frac{\log_2 (1+x)}{1+x} \\

 A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving strategy of making the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. The problems that can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm are those that have the following properties:
1. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
2. The optimal solution to the problem can be constructed by solving the subproblems in a greedy manner.
3. The subproblems are independent of each other.

The problem of finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with positive-integer edge weights (I) can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm, because the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, the optimal solution can be constructed by solving the subproblems in a greedy manner, and the subproblems are independent of each other.

The problem of finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph (II) cannot be solved by a standard greedy algorithm, because the problem does not have the property that the subproblems are independent of each other.

 We are given that P(D) = 0.05, P(TP | D) = 0.99, and P(TP | ~D) = 0.97. We want to find P(D | TP). We can use Bayes' theorem to find this: P(D | TP) = P(TP | D) * P(D) / P(TP). We are given P(TP | D) = 0.99 and P(D) = 0.05. We can find P(TP) by using the law of total probability: P(TP) = P(TP | D) * P(D) + P(TP | ~D) * P(~D) = 0.99 * 0.05 + 0.97 * 0.95 = 0.0495 + 0.9215 = 0.971. Now we can find P(D | TP): P(D | TP) = P(TP | D) * P(D) / P(TP) = 0.99 * 0.05 / 0.971 = 0.0495 / 0.971 = 0.0495 / 0.971 = 0.

= P(A) * P(B | A) / P(B)
= (1/2) * P(B | A) / (1/3)
= (3/6) * P(B | A) / (2/3)
We are also given that P(A | ¬B) = 1/4. We can use this to find P(B | A) as follows:
P(B | A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
= P(A | B) * P(B) / P(A)
= P(A | B) * (1/3) / (1/2)
= 2P(A | B) / 3

P(A | B) = (3/6) * (2P(A | B) / 3) / (2/3)

 The sum of the number of edges of all the faces is equal to the number of edges of the object. The number of edges of a pentagonal face is 5, and the number of edges of a hexagonal face is 6. So, we have 5k + 6m = total number of edges. The number of edges of a convex 3d-object is 3k + 3m, where k is the number of pentagonal faces and m is the number of hexagonal faces. So, we have 5k + 6m = 3k + 3m. Subtracting 3k from both sides, we have 2k + 6m = 3m. Subtracting 3m from both sides, we have 2k + 3m = 0. Subtracting 3m from both sides, we have 2k = -3m. Dividing both sides by -3, we have k = 3m/2. Since k is an integer, m must be even. Since m is even, m = 2n, where n is an integer. So, k = 3m/2 = 3(2n)/2 = 3n

The marginal physical product of labor (MPPL) is the change in the output of good Y when one more worker is employed. The total cost of production is the sum of the wage cost and the rent cost. The marginal cost of production is the change in the total cost when one more unit of capital is used. The marginal cost of production is equal to the marginal physical product of capital times the rent of a unit of capital. The marginal cost of production is also equal to the marginal physical product of labor times the wage. We know that the marginal physical product of labor is $2, so the marginal cost of production is $2 times the wage, which is $4. The marginal cost of production is also equal to the marginal physical product of capital times the rent, which is $1. Therefore, the marginal physical product of capital is $2 divided by $1, which is 2.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. The expected demand for automobiles is the number of automobiles that need to be replaced in a year. The number of automobiles that need to be replaced is the number of automobiles in the economy divided by the number of years each automobile is used. In this case, the number of automobiles is 60 million, and each automobile is used for 5 years. Therefore, the number of automobiles that need to be replaced is 60 million / 5 = 12 million. The population is growing at a rate of 2% per year, which means that the number of people who need automobiles is increasing by 2% per year. The number of people who need automobiles is the number of people in the economy multiplied by the number of people who need automobiles per person. In this case, the number of people in the economy is 240 million, and the number of people who need automobiles per person is 1. Therefore, the number of people who need automobiles is 240 million. The number of people who need automobiles is increasing by 2% per year, which means that the number of people who need automobiles is 240 million * (1 + 0.02) = 244.8 million. The

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. a) To find the point of profit maximization, we need to find the value of q that maximizes the profit function. The profit function is given by:
Profit = P * q - TC
= (15 - 0.05q) * q - (q + 0.02q^2)
= 15q - 0.05q^2 - q - 0.02q^2

To find the maximum profit, we need to find the value of q that maximizes the profit function. We can do this by taking the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q and setting it equal to zero:
d(Profit)/dq = 14 - 0.04q = 0
Solving for q, we get:

The marginal propensity to consume is 0.90, which means that 90% of the income is consumed and 10% is saved. The income tax rate is 0.26, which means that 26% of the income is paid as taxes. The total withdrawals are calculated as follows:
Total withdrawals = Consumption + Savings

We can do this by finding the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. The supply curve is given by the following equation:
Quantity supplied = 1200 + 400(P - 4.00)
The demand curve is given by the following equation:
Quantity demanded = 3000 - 500(P - 4.00)
We can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for P:
1200 + 400(P - 4.00) = 3000 - 500(P - 4.00)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
P = 4.10
So the equilibrium price is $4.10. To determine whether there would be a surplus or a shortage if price were set at $4.00, we can compare the quantity demanded at this price to the quantity supplied at this price. The quantity demanded at $4.00 is 3000 units, and the quantity supplied at $4.00 is 1200 units. Since the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, there would be a shortage of 1800

Plugging in the values, we get τ = 7500 / 0.09375 = 80,000 psi. Since the maximum shear stress is 8500 psi, we have that 80,000 < 8500, which is not possible. So we need to recalculate the key length. The key is also subjected to a compressive stress given by σ = P / A, where P is the force and A is the cross-sectional area of the key. We have that P = T / r, where r is the radius of the shaft. Plugging in the values, we get σ = 7500 / (π * (1)^2) = 19,000 psi. Since the maximum compressive stress is 16,500 psi, we have that 19,000 < 16,500, which is not possible. So we need to recalculate the key length. The key

 The heat transfer rate is given by Q = hA(T_1 - T_2), where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and T_1 and T_2 are the temperatures. We have that A = 2.0 ft * 1 ft = 2.0 ft^2, and T_1 - T_2 = 500°F - 120°F = 380°F. Plugging in the values, we get Q = h * 2.0 ft^2 * 380°F.

 The polytropic equation is PV^1.3 = C. We can rearrange this to get P = C/(V^1.3). We can also use the ideal gas equation PV = nRT to get P = nRT/V. Equating these two expressions for P, we get C/(V^1.3) = nRT/V. Solving for T, we get T = C/(nR V^1.3). We can use this expression to calculate the change in entropy. The change in entropy is given by ΔS = ∫(dQ/T), where dQ is the heat transferred. We can use the ideal gas equation to calculate dQ. We get dQ = nCp dT. Substituting this into the expression for ΔS, we get ΔS = ∫(nCp dT)/T. We can evaluate this integral using the expression for T we derived earlier. We get ΔS = nCp ln(T_f/T_i).

The weight of the log is given by ρVg, where ρ is the density of the log, V is its volume, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The weight of the water displaced is given by ρ_w V_w g, where ρ_w is the density of water. Setting these equal, we get ρVg = ρ_w V_w g. Since ρ = (2/3)ρ_w, we get V = V_w. Now, the volume of the log is given by πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Setting this equal to V_w, we get πr^2h = πr^2_d h_d, where r_d is the radius of the log when it is floating vertically. Since h = h_d, we get r = r_d. Now, the diameter-to-length ratio is given by 2r/h = 2r_d/h_d. Since h = h_d, we get 2r/r_d = 2, or r/r_d = 1. So the diameter-to-length ratio is 1

So we need to find the unit vector in the direction of E. E = -xa_x + ya_y + 3a_z. So the unit vector is E/||E|| = (-x/||E||)a_x + (y/||E||)a_y + (3/||E||)a_z. Now we need to find the value of x, y and z. We know that the charge is at (1, 3, -1). So we have that x = 1, y = 3 and z = -1. Now we can find the value of ||E||. ||E|| = sqrt((-x)^2 + (y)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9 + 9) = sqrt(19). So the unit vector is E/||E|| = (-1/√19)a_x + (3/√19)a_y + (3/√19)a_z.

 The electric field produced by a varying magnetic field is given by the Faraday’s law of induction, which states that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic field. So we have that \nabla x E = - dB/dt. Since the magnetic field is in the z-direction, we have that dB/dt = bB_0e^bta_z. The curl of the electric field is given by \nabla x E = - \partial E_x / \partial y + \partial E_y / \partial x. Since the magnetic field is in the z-direction, we have that E_x = E_y = 0. So the curl of the electric field is given by \nabla x E = \partial E_z / \partial x. So we have that \partial E_z / \partial x = - bB_0e^bta_z. Integrating this equation with respect to x, we get E_z = - (1/2)bB_0e^bta_x + C, where C is a constant. Since the electric field is a vector, we have that E = - (1/2)bB_0e^btra_

 The boundary layer thickness is given by \delta = \sqrt{\frac{\nu x}{U_0}}, where \nu is the kinematic viscosity, x is the distance from the leading edge, and U_0 is the free-stream velocity. Plugging in the given values, we get \delta = \sqrt{\frac{7.5 \times 10^-4 \times 2}{12}} = 0.0022 ft. The shear stress is given by \tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}, where \mu is the dynamic viscosity, u is the velocity, and y is the distance from the plate. Since we are at a distance of 2 in. from the leading edge, we have y = 2/12 = 1/6 ft. The velocity at this point is given by u = U_0 - \frac{\nu}{y} = 12 - \frac{7.5 \times 10^-4}{1/6} = 11.5 ft/s. So the shear stress is \tau = 7.5 \times 10^-4 \times \frac{11.5}{1/6} = 0.229 lb_f/ft^2. The

 The speed of a dc motor is given by the equation N = (V - IaRa - IfRf) / (2πKf), where N is the speed, V is the voltage, Ia is the armature current, Ra is the armature resistance, If is the field current, Rf is the field resistance, and Kf is the field constant. Plugging in the given values, we get N = (120 - 40*0.2 - 40*60/120) / (2πKf) = 1800 rpm. To find the speed at half load, we need to find the current at half load. Since the motor is a shunt motor, the current is proportional to the load, so the current at half load is 20 A. Plugging this in, we get N = (120 - 20*0.2 - 20*60/120) / (2πKf) = 1870 rpm. To find the speed at an overload of 125 percent, we need to find the current at this load. Since the current is proportional to the load, the current at an overload of 125 percent is 50 A.

 The current through an inductor is given by L di/dt = V_L. We can solve this differential equation using the given voltage functions. For (a), we have that V_L = 0.5tV for 0 \leq t \leq 3s, so di/dt = (0.5V)/L, and i_L = (0.5Vt)/L for 0 \leq t \leq 3s. At t = 2s, we have i_L = (0.5V*2)/L = 1V/L. For (b), we have that V_L = 0.5(t+2)V for -2 \leq t \leq 1s, so di/dt = (0.5V)/L, and i_L = (0.5V(t+2))/L for -2 \leq t \leq 1s. At t = 2s, we have i_L = (0.5V*4)/L = 2V/L.

 The equation of state for a gas is given by PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles of gas. We can rewrite this as PV = kT, where k is a constant. Now, we can use the given information to find the value of k. We have that \alpha = (1 / V)(\partialV / \partialT)_P = k_1(C_P / C_V)T^{(C)P/(C)V}-1, so we can write \partialV / \partialT = k_1(C_P / C_V)VT^{(C)P/(C)V}-1. Now, we can use the fact that \partialV / \partialT = -V \beta P to write -V \beta P = k_1(C_P / C_V)VT^{(C)P/(C)V}-1. Now, we can solve for V to get V = k_2P^{-1}T^{(C)V/(C)P}. Now, we can use the fact that PV = kT to write P = kT / V = kT / (k_2P^{-1}T^{(C)V/(C)P}) = k_2

 Let $x$ be the distance from the building to the foot of the ladder. Then the distance from the building to the top of the ladder is $26-x$. The rate at which the foot of the ladder moves away from the building is 3 feet per second. The rate at which the top of the ladder moves down is the rate at which the foot of the ladder moves away from the building minus the rate at which the top of the ladder moves up. The rate at which the top of the ladder moves up is the rate at which the foot of the ladder moves away from the building times the tangent of the angle between the ladder and the ground. The angle between the ladder and the ground is $\tan^{-1} \frac{10}{26-10}=\tan^{-1} \frac{10}{16}=\tan^{-1} \frac{5}{8}$. The rate at which the top of the ladder moves up is $3 \cdot \frac{5}{8}=\frac{15}{8}$ feet per second. The rate at which the top of the ladder moves down is $3-\frac{15}{8}=\frac{6}{8}=\frac{3}{4}$ feet per second. The answer

 Let $s(t)$ denote the number of pounds of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0)=0$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The salt poured into the tank adds $\frac{1}{2}$ pounds of salt per gallon. There are always 100 gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ pounds of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ pounds per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ pounds of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(1 / 2) 2-(s / 50)=(1-s) / 50$, and so $[s(t)=1] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

We divide the interval $[0, 500]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal length, and approximate the integral by the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 x_{i} \Delta x$. Here $x_{i}$ is the $i$th subinterval, and $\Delta x$ is the length of each subinterval. We have $x_{i}=i \Delta x$, and $\Delta x=500 / n$. Then the sum becomes $\sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 i \Delta x^{2}$.

\int_{0}^{10} c(t) d t=\int_{0}^{10} 20 t e^{-0.6 t} d t .
$$
We can evaluate this integral using integration by parts. Let $u=t$ and $d v=e^{-0.6 t} d t$. Then $d u=d t$ and $v=-\frac{1}{0.6} e^{-0.6 t}$. Then
$$
\int_{0}^{10} c(t) d t=20 \int_{0}^{10} t e^{-0.6 t} d t=20\left[t \frac{e^{-0.6 t}}{-0.6}-\int_{0}^{10} \frac{e^{-0.6 t}}{-0.6}

 The probability of a match on the $i$ th draw is $\frac{i-1}{n-1}$, since there are $i-1$ balls that are not numbered $i$ and $n-1$ balls in total. The probability of a match on the $i$ th draw is independent of the previous draws, so the probability of a match on all four draws is $\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{0}{1}=\frac{1}{4}$. The probability of no match on all four draws is $1-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$. The probability of a match on the $i$ th draw is independent of the previous draws, so the probability of a match on all $n$ draws is $\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n$. The limit of this probability as $n$ increases without bound is $e^{-1}$, which is option B.

 We want to find the mean setting so that a 12-ounce cup will overflow less than 1% of the time. This means that we want to find the mean setting so that the probability that the number of ounces delivered is greater than 12 is less than 0.01. Since the standard deviation is 0.3, we know that the number of ounces delivered is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma=0.3$. We want to find $\mu$ such that $P(X>12)<0.01$. We know that $P(X>12)=1-P(X\leq 12)=1-\Phi\left(\frac{12-\mu}{0.3}\right)$. We want to find $\mu$ such that $1-\Phi\left(\frac{12-\mu}{0.3}\right)<0.01$. We know that $\Phi(x)=1-\Phi(-x)$, so we can rewrite the inequality as $\Phi\left(\frac{\mu-12}{0.3}\right)>0.99$. We know that $\Phi(x)$ is an increasing function, so we can rewrite the inequality as $\frac{\mu-12}{0.3}>1

 We have a sample of 40 new homes with an average building time of 83 days. The variance is 386. We want to find the confidence interval for the average building time. We use the formula for the confidence interval for the mean of a normal distribution. We have $n = 40, \bar{x} = 83, \sigma^2 = 386$. We want to find the confidence interval for $\mu$ with confidence level $1 - \alpha$. We have $t_{\alpha / 2, 39} = 2.021$ (from a t-table). Then the confidence interval is $\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha / 2, 39} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 83 \pm 2.021 \frac{\sqrt{386}}{\sqrt{40}} = 83 \pm 10.45$. We want to find the confidence level for which the interval $[80, 90]$ is contained in the interval. We have $80 < 83 - 10.45 < 90$, so the confidence level is $1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{0}^{10.45}

 The number of trailing zeros in $k!$ is the number of factors of 5 in $k!$. The number of factors of 5 in $k!$ is the number of multiples of 5 in $k!$ plus the number of multiples of 25 in $k!$ plus the number of multiples of 125 in $k!$ and so on. The number of multiples of 5 in $k!$ is $\left\lfloor\frac{k}{5}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{k}{25}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{k}{125}\right\rfloor+\cdots$. The number of multiples of 25 in $k!$ is $\left\lfloor\frac{k}{25}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{k}{125}\right\rfloor+\cdots$.

 The expected amount won is the sum of the probability of winning multiplied by the amount won, and the probability of losing multiplied by the amount lost. The probability of winning is $5 / (5+k)$, and the probability of losing is $k / (5+k)$. The expected amount won is $0.5$, so we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{5+k} \cdot 2-\frac{k}{5+k} \cdot 2 &= 0.5 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad \frac{10}{5+k}-\frac{2 k}{5+k} &= 0.5 \\

v(t)=t \cos (t)-\ln (t+2)=0
$$
We can solve this equation by using the Newton-Raphson method. We have

 The binormal vector is the cross product of the tangent and normal vectors. The tangent vector is $\frac{d}{dt} r(t) = (6+10t)i - 8j$. The normal vector is $\frac{d}{dt} \times r(t) = (10t)i + 8j$. Then the binormal vector is
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \times \frac{d}{dt} r(t) &= (10t)i + 8j \times (6+10t)i - 8j \\
&= (10t)(6+10t)i + 8j(8)k \\
&= (60t+100t^2)i + 64jk.

 The mass is attached to a dashpot mechanism that has a damping constant of $0.25 \mathrm{lb} \cdot \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{ft}$ and is acted on by an external force of $4 \cos 2 t \mathrm{lb}$. The mass is stretched 6 in by a mass that weighs $8 \mathrm{lb}$. The mass is replaced by a mass $m$. The amplitude of the steady state response is maximum when the damping ratio is 1. The damping ratio is $\zeta=\frac{b}{2 \sqrt{k m}}$, where $b$ is the damping constant, $k$ is the spring constant, and $m$ is the mass. We have $b=0.25 \mathrm{lb} \cdot \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{ft}$, $k=\frac{8}{6} \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{ft}$, and we want to find $m$ such that $\zeta=1$. Then $\zeta=1 \Rightarrow \frac{0.25}{2 \sqrt{\frac{8}{6} m}}=1 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{8}{6} m}=0.

Since $f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b)$, we have $f(2a) = f(a+a) = f(a) + f(a) = 2f(a)$. Since $f(2a) = 2f(a)$, we have $f(2a) = f(a) + f(a) = 2f(a)$, so $f(a)

We get $n \frac{a_{1}+(a_{1}+(n-1) 2)}{2}=240$. Simplifying, we get $n \frac{2 a_{1}+2 n-2}{2}=240$. Simplifying further, we get $n a_{1}+n-1=240$. We can write $a_{1}=2 k+1$ for some integer $k$.

We can divide both sides by 900 to get 1111a + 111b + 11c + d = 0. We can subtract 1111a from both sides to get 111b + 11c + d = -1111a. We can divide both sides by 11 to get 11b + c + d/11 = -111a/11. We can subtract 11b from both sides to get c + d/11 = -111a/11 - 11b. We can multiply both sides by 11 to get 11c + d = -111a - 121b.

 We know that $U$ is the set of all matrices $X$ such that $TX = XT$. This means that $X$ commutes with $T$. We also know that $W$ is the set of all matrices $TX - XT$ for all $X \in M(V)$. This means that $W$ is the set of all matrices that are not commutative with $T$.
We know that $M(V)$ is a vector space of dimension $n^2$. We also know that $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of $M(V)$. Hence, $U$ and $W$ are also vector spaces. We know that $U$ is the set of all matrices that commute with $T$, and $W$ is the set of all matrices that do not commute with $T$. Hence, $U$ and $W$ are orthogonal complements of each other.

We also know that $dim(U) < n$ because $U$ is a subspace of $M(V)$ and $M(V)$ has dimension $n^2$. Hence, $dim(U) < n$.

 The volume of the liver is the sum of the volumes of the cross-sectional areas. The volume of the $i$ th cross-sectional area is $1.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot A_i$, where $A_i$ is the cross-sectional area. Then the volume of the liver is
\begin{align*}
V &=\sum_{i=1}^{9} 1.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot A_i \\
&=0.75 \sum_{i=1}^{9} A_i \\
&=0.75(0+18+58+79+94+106+117+128+63+39+0) \\

 The area bounded by the curves $y=\cos x$ and $y=\cos ^2 x$ between $x=0$ and $x=\pi$ is given by the integral $\int_{0}^{\pi} \cos ^2 x-\cos x d x$. We can evaluate this integral by using integration by parts. Let $u=\cos x$ and $d v=\cos x d x$. Then $d u=-\sin x$ and $v=\sin x$. Hence, we have
$$
\int_{0}^{\pi} \cos ^2 x-\cos x d x=\left[\sin x \cos x\right]_{0}^{\pi}-\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin x \cos x d x .
$$
We can evaluate the integral on the right-hand side by using integration by parts again. Let $u=\sin x$ and $d v=\cos x d x$. Then $d u=\cos x$ and $v=-\cos x$. Hence, we have

 Let $I(t)$ be the number of infected people at time $t$. Then $I(0) = 160$ and $I(7) = 1200$. We have that $I^{\prime}(t) = k I(t)(5000-I(t))$ for some constant $k$. Then $I^{\prime}(0) = k \cdot 160 \cdot 4840 = 123,520 k$ and $I^{\prime}(7) = k \cdot 1200 \cdot 3800 = 45,600,000 k$. Then $123,520 k = 45,600,000 k / 7$, so $k = 45,600,000 / 7 \cdot 160 = 8640$. Then $I(t) = 160 e^{8640 t} + C$ for some constant $C$. Then $I(7) = 1200 = 160 e^{8640 \cdot 7} + C$, so $C = 1040$. Then $I(t) = 160 e^{8640 t} + 1040$. We want to find $t$ such that $I(t) = 0.8 \

 We have $y^{\prime}+\frac{1}{4} y=3+2 \cos 2 t$. We can solve this differential equation using the method of undetermined coefficients. We assume that $y(t)=A \cos 2 t+B \sin 2 t+C$. Then $y^{\prime}(t)=-2 A \sin 2 t+2 B \cos 2 t$. Substituting these into the differential equation we get $-2 A \sin 2 t+2 B \cos 2 t+\frac{1}{4}(A \cos 2 t+B \sin 2 t)=3+2 \cos 2 t$. Equating coefficients we get $A=-12, B=8$. Then $y(t)=-12 \cos 2 t+8 \sin 2 t$. We want to find the value of $t$ for which $y(t)=12$. We have $-12 \cos 2 t+8 \sin 2 t=12$.

 There are $10^4$ possible permutations of 4 digits. The number of winning permutations is the number of permutations of 4 digits that contain 6, 7, 8, 9. This is the number of permutations of 2 digits that contain 6, 7, 8, 9, times 3. The number of permutations of 2 digits that contain 6, 7, 8, 9 is the number of permutations of 2 digits that do not contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, times 6. The number of permutations of 2 digits that do not contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 4 times 3, so the number of permutations of 2 digits that contain 6, 7, 8, 9 is 4 times 3 times 6. Hence the number of winning permutations is 3 times 4 times 3 times 6. The probability of winning is the number of winning permutations divided by the number of possible permutations, so the probability of winning is $\frac{3 \times 4 \times 3 \times 6}{10^

 We have a one-sided test with a P-value of 0.075. The P-value is the probability that the test statistic is at least as extreme as the observed value, given that the null hypothesis is true. The test statistic is a t-statistic, and the null hypothesis is that the population mean is 0. The observed value of the t-statistic is in the right tail of the distribution, since the P-value is 0.075. The t-distribution is symmetric about 0, so the P-value is the same as the probability that the t-statistic is at least as extreme as the observed value, given that the null hypothesis is true.

First iteration: $x_2 = 1$, $f(x_2) = \log_{10}(1) - 1 + 3 = 1.5$, $f^{\prime}(x_2) = -1 - \log_{10}(1) = -2$. Then $x_3 = x_2 - \frac{f(x_2)}{f^{\prime}(x_2)} = 1 - \frac{1.5}{-2} = 1.75$. Second iteration: $x_3 = 1.75$, $f(x_3) = \log_{10}(1.75) - 1.75 + 3 = 0.5$, $f^{\prime}(x_3) = -1 - \log_{10}(1.75) = -1

 We want to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. We can find this number by adding 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5. The least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60. So the number we are looking for is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 60 = 70. The answer is (none of the above).

 The work done is the sum of the work done by the rope and the work done by the water. The work done by the rope is the integral of the force exerted by the rope times the distance traveled by the rope. The force exerted by the rope is the weight of the rope, which is $0.8 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}$, times the acceleration due to gravity, which is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$. The distance traveled by the rope is the height of the bucket, which is $12 \mathrm{~m}$. Hence the work done by the rope is

Then $T^{\prime}(0) = -k(200 - 70) = -k \cdot 130$. We also have $T^{\prime}(1) = -k(190 - 70) = -k \cdot 120$. Then $-k \cdot 130 = -k \cdot 120$, so $k = 1.08$. Then $T^{\prime}(t) = -1.08(T(t) - 70)$. We want to find $t$ such that $T(t) = 150$. Then $T^{\prime}(t) = -1.08(150 - 70) = -1.08 \cdot 80 = -8.64$.

 We know that $X_1$ is the first arrival time, and $N(t) = 1$ means that there is only one arrival in the interval $[0, t]$. Then $X_1 \leq t / 2$ means that the first arrival is in the interval $[0, t / 2]$. The probability of this is the probability that the first arrival is in the interval $[0, t / 2]$ given that there is only one arrival in the interval $[0, t]$. This probability is the ratio of the probability of the first arrival being in the interval $[0, t / 2]$ to the probability of there being only one arrival in the interval $[0, t]$. The probability of the first arrival being in the interval $[0, t / 2]$ is $\frac{t / 2}{t} = \frac{1}{2}$. The probability of there being only one arrival in the interval $[0, t]$ is $e^{-4 t} \frac{(4 t)^1}{1!} = 4 t e^{-4 t}$. Then the probability of $X_1 \leq t / 2

 We want to find the sample size $n$ such that the maximum error of the estimate of $p$ is equal to 0.03 with 95% confidence. We use the formula $n = \frac{z^2 \sigma^2}{E^2}$, where $z$ is the $z$-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the proportion, and $E$ is the maximum error. We have $z = 1.96$ for 95% confidence, $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ and $E = 0.03$. We substitute these values into the formula and solve for $n$:
\begin{align*}
n &= \frac{(1.96)^2 \cdot \frac{p(1-p)}{n}}{(0.03)^2} \\
n &= \frac{3.8416 \cdot p(1-p)}{(0.0009)} \\

The outflow velocity $v$ at the outlet is equal to the velocity of a particle falling freely from the height $h$, so we have $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$. The outflow velocity $v$ is also equal to the velocity of the liquid flowing out of the tank, so we have $v=\frac{h}{t}$, where $t$ is the time it takes to drain the tank down to the level of the outlet. Equating the two expressions for $v$, we have $\frac{h}{t}=\sqrt{2 g h}$, and so $t=\frac{h}{\sqrt{2 g h}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 g}}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$, so we have $t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \cdot 9.8}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{19.6}}=0.535 \mathrm{~s}$. The height

 We want to find the sample size $n$ such that the maximum error of the estimate of the mean strength $\mu$ of the left hinge on a vanity cover molded by a machine is 0.25 with 98% confidence. We have $\bar{x}=35.68$, $s=1.723$, and $n=32$. We use the formula for the maximum error of the estimate of the mean strength $\mu$ of the left hinge on a vanity cover molded by a machine, which is $E = \frac{Z \sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $Z$ is the $Z$-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the sample, and $n$ is the sample size.

 We want to find the minimum sample size. We know that the margin of error is 2.5%, and we want a 95% confidence interval. Thus we use the formula $n = \frac{z^2 \sigma^2}{E^2}$, where $n$ is the sample size, $z$ is the z-score for the desired confidence level, $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $E$ is the margin of error. We know that $z = 1.96$ for a 95% confidence interval, and we don't know $\sigma$, but we know that the margin of error is 2.5%. Thus we use the formula $n = \frac{(1.96)^2 \sigma^2}{(0.025)^2}$. We also know that the sample size is at least 39, so we use the formula $n = \frac{(1.96)^2 \sigma^2}{(0.025)^2} \geq 39$. Solving for $\sigma$ we get $\sigma \geq \frac{0.025}{1.96 / \sqrt{n}}$.

 The bird has 3 choices for each of the 3 dimensions. Thus the number of possible paths is $3^3=27$. The probability of each path is $1/27$. The entropy rate is $-\sum_{i=1}^{27} p_i \log_2 p_i$, where $p_i$ is the probability of the $i$th path. Since all paths have the same probability, we have $-\sum_{i=1}^{27} p_i \log_2 p_i=-\log_2 1/27=\log_2 27=\log_2 3^3=3 \log_2 3 \approx 4.58$. The answer is (none of the above).

 The energy added to the system is the product of the voltage across the resistor and the current through it, or $25.0 \mathrm{ohm} \times 1.75 \mathrm{~A} \times 100 \mathrm{~s} = 437.5 \mathrm{~J}$. The energy added to the system increases the internal energy of the system, which is proportional to the temperature. The final temperature is given by the equation $Q = mc \Delta T$, where $Q$ is the energy added, $m$ is the mass of the system, $c$ is the specific heat capacity of water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

 The temperature of the air in the pump is the same as the temperature of the air in the tire, so we can use the ideal gas law to solve for the temperature. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. We can rearrange this to get T = P V / n R. We know that the pressure is 24.5 lb/in^2, and the volume is the volume of the tire, which we don't know. However, we can use the fact that the air is compressed adiabatically to relate the initial and final temperatures. The adiabatic index is given by $\gamma = C_p/C_v$, where $C_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure and $C_v$ is the specific heat at constant volume. We can use this to relate the initial and final temperatures. The initial temperature is 300K, and the final temperature is T. We can set up the following equation: $T = (P_1 V_1 / n R)^{\gamma} = (24.5 lb/in^2 V_1 / n R)^{1.40

 The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is given by $g = G M / R^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the earth, and $R$ is the radius of the earth. Since the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the new planet is the same, we can set up the equation $g = G M / R^2$, where $M$ is the mass of the new planet. Since the density of the new planet is twice that of the earth, the mass of the new planet is twice that of the earth, or $2 M_{\text{earth}}$. Substituting this into the equation, we get $g = G (2 M_{\text{earth}}) / R^2$. Since the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the earth is $g$, we can set up the equation $g = G M_{\text{earth}} / R^2_{\text{earth}}$.

 The mass of the earth is the volume of the earth times its average density, or (4/3)\pir^3 \times 5.5 × 10^3 kg/m^3. The gravitational force between two objects is given by F = G \times (m1 \times m2)/r^2, where m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them. In this case, the gravitational force between the earth and an object of mass m at the surface of the earth is F = G \times (m \times M)/r^2, where M is the mass of the earth. Since the force is equal to the weight of the object, we can set F = m \times g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Solving for G, we get G = (m \times g \times r^2)/M.

 The boat travels 1 mile downstream in 15 minutes, so it travels 4 miles per hour downstream. Since the boat is traveling at a constant speed with respect to the water, the speed of the boat with respect to the riverbank is the sum of the speed of the boat with respect to the water and the speed of the water with respect to the riverbank. The speed of the water with respect to the riverbank is the current. So the current is 4 miles per hour minus the speed of the boat with respect to the water. The speed of the boat with respect to the water is v, so the current is 4 - v. The boat travels 1 mile upstream in 15 minutes, so it travels 4 miles per hour upstream. Since the speed of the boat with respect to the water is v, the speed of the boat with respect to the riverbank is v - 4. The distance traveled upstream is 1 mile, so the time it takes to travel 1 mile upstream is 1 / (v - 4).

 The moment of inertia of a sphere is given by $I = (2/5)mr^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the sphere and $r$ is its radius. The moment of inertia of our sphere is 0.06 kg·m^2, so its mass is 0.06 kg·m^2 / (2/5) = 0.15 kg. The angular speed of the sphere is 20 rad/s, so its angular momentum is 0.15 kg·m^2·20 rad/s = 3 kg·m^2·s. The friction force is 2.0 N, and it is applied a distance of 0.30 m from the sphere’s center, so the torque it produces is 2.0 N·0.30 m = 0.6 N·m. The time it takes the sphere to come to rest is given by the equation $\tau = L/I\alpha$, where $\tau$ is the time, $L$ is the angular momentum, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

 The kinetic energy of an electron is given by $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron. The potential energy of the electron is given by $U = qV$, where $q$ is the charge of the electron. The total energy of the electron is the sum of these two energies, or $K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + qV$. Since the electron is accelerated from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero, and the final kinetic energy is equal to the total energy. Thus, we can solve for the final velocity: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = qV = eV = 25,000 eV = 25,000 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} J = 4 \times 10^{-16} J$.

 The gain constant is 2% per meter, so the gain per meter is 0.02. The wavelength is 6328 A°, so the gain per meter is 0.02/6328 = 3.15 × 10^-6 per meter. The lifetime of the upper state is 10^-7 sec, so the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission is 1/10^-7 = 10^7 sec^-1. The Einstein coefficient for stimulated emission is the same as the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. The Einstein coefficient for absorption is the same as the Einstein coefficient for stimulated emission. The population inversion density is given by the formula n_j-n_i(g_j/g_i), where n_j is the population of the upper state, n_i is the population of the lower state, g_j is the degeneracy of the upper state, and g_i is the degeneracy of the lower state.

 The gravitational attraction between two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. To neutralize the gravitational attraction, we need to place equal positive charges on both objects, which will create an electric force that cancels out the gravitational force.

 The centripetal acceleration is given by $a_c = v^2/r$, where $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity and $r$ is the radius of the circle. The magnitude of the velocity is given by $v = \sqrt{v_i^2 + v_f^2} = \sqrt{(400)^2 + (500)^2} = 600 \mathrm{m/s}$. The radius of the circle is given by $r = v_i \times 24 \mathrm{s} = (400 \hat{\mathrm{i}} + 500 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \times 24 \mathrm{s} = 9600 \hat{\mathrm{i}} + 12000 \hat{\mathrm{j}} \mathrm{m}$.

 The shift in fringes is proportional to the difference in refractive indices, so we can write $\Delta n = n_2 - n_1 = 16 \Delta x / d$, where $\Delta x$ is the width of the cuvette and $d$ is the wavelength of light. We are given that $n_1 = 1.462$, so we can solve for $n_2$: $n_2 = 1.462 + 16 \Delta x / d$. We are also given that the distribution of the solution is linear, so we can write $n(x) = n_1 + (n_2 - n_1) x / \Delta x$. We can then write the average refractive index as $n_{avg} = \int_{0}^{\Delta x} n(x) dx = \int_{0}^{\Delta x} (n_1 + (n_2 - n_1) x / \Delta x) dx = (n_1 + n_2) \Delta x / 2$.

 The force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$. Since the spheres are identical, the charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Let $q$ be the magnitude of the charge on each sphere. Then the initial force is $F_1 = k \frac{q^2}{(0.5 \mathrm{~m})^2} = 0.108 \mathrm{~N}$. The final force is $F_2 = k \frac{q^2}{(0.5 \mathrm{~m})^2} = 0.0360 \mathrm{~N}$. Since the charges are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign, the final force is attractive, so the magnitude of the charge on each sphere has decreased. The ratio of the final force to the initial force is $\frac{F_2}{F_1} = \frac{0.0360 \mathrm{~N}}{0.108 \mathrm{~N}} = \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the magnitude of the charge on each sphere has decreased by a factor of $\sqrt{\frac{1

 The angle between two vectors is given by the formula $\cos \phi = \frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{\|\vec{a}\| \|\vec{b}\|}$.

The magnitudes of the vectors are $\|\vec{a}\| = \sqrt{3.0^2 + 4.0^2} = 5.0$ and $\|\vec{b}\| = \sqrt{(-2.0)^2 + 3.0^2} = \sqrt{4.0 + 9.0} = 5.0$.

 The force of attraction between the electrons and the nuclei is given by Coulomb's law, which is F = k * q1 * q2 / r^2, where k is Coulomb's constant, q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them. The charge of an electron is -1.6 × 10^-19 C, and the charge of a proton is +1.6 × 10^-19 C. The number of electrons in a gram of copper is Avogadro's number times the number of moles of copper, which is 63.5 g / mole, times the number of electrons per mole of copper, which is 1. The number of protons in a gram of copper is the same as the number of electrons.

The force is given by the integral of the density times the gravitational constant times the volume element. The volume element is the area times the depth, and the area is the surface area of a sphere times the cosine of the angle between the surface and the depth. The surface area of a sphere is $4\pi r^2$, and the cosine of the angle between the surface and the depth is $\frac{r}{R}$, where $R$ is the radius of the earth. So the force is given by the integral of the density times the gravitational constant times the area times the depth times the cosine of the angle between the surface and the depth. The integral is over the volume of the sphere, which is $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$. So the force is given by the density times the gravitational constant times the volume of the sphere times the average value of the cosine of the angle between the surface and the depth.

 The electric field just above the surface of a conductor is proportional to the charge on the conductor. The electric field is given by Coulomb's law, E = kQ/r^2, where Q is the charge, r is the distance from the charge, and k is Coulomb's constant. We are given the electric field, so we can solve for the charge. The charge is Q = E r^2 / k. We are given the electric field, the distance from the charge (the radius of the conductor), and Coulomb's constant.

 The total heat energy of the system is conserved, so the heat energy gained by the coffee is equal to the heat energy lost by the cup. The heat energy gained by the coffee is $Q_c = mc\Delta T = 0.300 kg \cdot 4186 J/kg°C \cdot (70.0°C - T_f)$, and the heat energy lost by the cup is $Q_c = mc\Delta T = 0.120 kg \cdot 900 J/kg°C \cdot (T_f - 20.0°C)$. Equating these two expressions, we can solve for $T_f$: \begin{align*}
0.300 kg \cdot 4186 J/kg°C \cdot (70.0°C - T_f) &= 0.120 kg \cdot 900 J/kg°C \cdot (T_f - 20.0°C)\\

 The total surface area of the Earth is $4\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the Earth. The electric current intercepted by the total surface area of the planet is the rate at which protons are intercepted, which is 1500 protons per second, times the total surface area of the planet. The total surface area of the planet is $4\pi (6.37\times 10^6\text{ m})^2 = 5.10\times 10^{8}\text{ m}^2$.

 The electric field due to the first charge is $E_1 = k q_1 / x^2$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant. The electric field due to the second charge is $E_2 = k (-4 q_1) / (x-12.0 \mathrm{~mm})^2$. We want the net electric field to be zero at $x=2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$, so we set $E_1 + E_2 = 0$ and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
\frac{k q_1}{x^2} - \frac{k (-4 q_1)}{(x-12.0 \mathrm{~mm})^2} &= 0\\

 The angle of minimum deviation is the angle of deviation when the prism is placed in the path of a light beam at the angle of refraction. The angle of refraction is given by the formula $\sin \theta = n_1 \sin \phi$, where $\theta$ is the angle of refraction, $n_1$ is the refractive index of the prism, and $\phi$ is the angle of incidence. In our case, the angle of incidence is the angle of minimum deviation, and the angle of refraction is the angle of deviation. The angle of deviation is given by the formula $\delta = \theta - \phi$. So we have $\sin \phi = n_2 \sin \theta$, where $n_2$ is the refractive index of water. Solving for $\phi$, we get $\phi = \arcsin (n_2 \sin \theta)$. Substituting this into the formula for $\delta$, we get $\delta = \theta - \arcsin (n_2 \sin \theta)$. The angle of minimum deviation is the value of $\delta$ when $\theta$ is minimized. To minimize $\theta$, we set $\sin \theta = 1$, which gives

 The man's mass is 150 lb, and the platform's mass is 500 lb, so the total mass is 650 lb. The moment of inertia of a circular platform about its axis is $I = (1/2)mr^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $r$ is the radius. So the moment of inertia of the platform is $(1/2)(650 lb)(6 ft)^2 = 4650 lb-ft^2$. The initial angular speed is 30 rpm, or 30/60 = 0.5 rad/sec. The man's mass is 150 lb, and his speed is 12 ft/sec, so his angular momentum is $L = r \times p = (6 ft)(12 ft/sec) = 72 lb-ft-sec$. The total angular momentum is the sum of the man's and the platform's, so $L = 4650 lb-ft^2 \times 0.5 rad/sec + 72 lb-ft-sec = 4650 lb-ft^2 \times 0.5 rad/sec + 72 lb-ft-sec = 4650 lb-ft^2 \times 0.5 rad/sec + 72 lb-ft-sec$.

 The electric field is directed vertically down, so the charge density is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field. The charge density at 200 m is 100 N/C / 60 N/C = 5/3 times the charge density at 300 m. The charge contained in the cube is the charge density times the volume of the cube, which is 100 m x 100 m x 100 m = 1,000,000 cubic meters. The total charge is the sum of the charges at the two altitudes, which is 5/3 times the charge at 300 m minus the charge at 300 m. The charge at 300 m is the charge density times the volume of the cube at 300 m, which is 1,000,000 cubic meters times 60 N/C / 100 N/C = 6,000 coulombs. The charge at 200 m is the charge density times the volume of the cube at 200 m, which is 1,000,000 cubic meters times 100 N/C / 60 N/C = 10,000 coulombs.

We are given that $F = 1/2 lb = 0.5 lbf = 0.5 \times 32.2 ft/s^2 = 25.1 N$. We are also given that the stone comes to rest after 100 ft, so the distance it travels is equal to the initial velocity times the time of motion, or $v_0 t = 100 ft$.

 In a perfectly elastic collision, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision. The momentum of the larger marble before the collision is 100 g cm/sec, and after the collision is 60 g cm/sec. The momentum of the smaller marble before the collision is 0, and after the collision is its mass times its speed. So the momentum of the smaller marble after the collision is 25 g times its speed. The total momentum before the collision is 100 g cm/sec, and the total momentum after the collision is 25 g times the speed of the smaller marble plus 60 g cm/sec. Equating these two, we can solve for the speed of the smaller marble: 25 g times the speed of the smaller marble + 60 g cm/sec = 100 g cm/sec. Subtracting 60 g cm/sec from both sides, we get 25 g times the speed of the smaller marble = 40 g cm/sec. Dividing both sides by 25 g, we get the speed of the smaller marble = 1.6 cm/sec.

 The number of coulombs of charge in 1 mole of a substance is given by the number of electrons in that substance, times the charge of an electron. In the case of neutral molecular hydrogen, each molecule has one electron, so the total number of electrons is 2 times the number of molecules, or 2 times Avogadro's number. The charge of an electron is 1.6 x 10^-19 C, so the total charge is 2 times Avogadro's number times 1.6 x 10^-19 C, or 3.2 x 10^-19 C. To convert this to megacoulombs, we divide by 10^6, so the answer is 0.032 MC. The answer is not among the options, so we can't choose it. The answer is (None of the above).

 Newton's version of Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the mean orbital radius. So if we let $P$ be the orbital period of Mercury, we have $P^2 \propto (5.8 \times 10^{10})^3$, or $P^2 \propto 2.45 \times 10^{23}$. Since the mass of the Sun is 1.99x10^30 kg, we have $P^2 \propto (1.99 \times 10^{30})^{-1}$, or $P^2 \propto 5.05 \times 10^{20}$. Combining these two expressions, we have $P^2 = 2.45 \times 10^{23} \times 5.05 \times 10^{20}$, or $P^2 = 1.23 \times 10^{44}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $P = 3.53 \times 10^22$ seconds. Converting this to Earth days, we have $P = 3.53 \times 10^22$ seconds /

 The distance between the screen and the position of the screen required for a bright spot to appear for the first time is the distance for the first minimum, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion, $d = 1.22 \lambda f/D$, where $d$ is the distance, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $f$ is the focal length of the lens, and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture. We are given that this distance is 36.2 cm, so we can solve for $\lambda$ to get $\lambda = 1.17 \times 10^{-6}$ m. The distance between the screen and the position of the screen required for a dark spot to appear for the first time is the distance for the first maximum, which is given by the Rayleigh criterion, $d = 0.61 \lambda f/D$, where $d$ is the distance, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $f$ is the focal length of the lens, and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.

 The amount of light that strikes the photocell is proportional to the area of the aperture and the intensity of the light source. The area of the aperture is 15 mm times 40 mm, or 0.6 square mm. The intensity of the light source is 50 candles, or 50 times the intensity of a standard candle. The total amount of light that strikes the photocell is then 0.6 square mm times 50, or 30 lumens. Since at least 0.2 lumen must strike the photocell to operate the relay, the maximum permissible distance is the distance at which 30 lumens minus 0.2 lumen can be obtained. This distance is given by the inverse square law, or $d = \sqrt{\frac{I_0 \cdot A}{I - I_0}}$, where $I_0$ is the intensity of the light source, $A$ is the area of the aperture, $I$ is the minimum intensity required to operate the relay, and $d$ is the distance. Plugging in the values, we get $d = \sqrt{\frac{50 \cdot 0.6}{30 - 0.2}} = 78.7$ cm

 (a) The minimum number of lines a grating must have in order to resolve these lines in the first order spectrum is given by the formula $d \sin \theta = \lambda$, where $d$ is the distance between the lines, $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. Since the grating is in the first order, $\theta = 30^\circ$. The distance between the lines is the difference in wavelength, or 0.594 m\mu. Plugging in the values, we get $d \sin 30^\circ = 0.594 m\mu$, or $d = 0.594 m\mu / 0.5 = 1.188 m\mu$. The minimum number of lines is then $1.188 m\mu / 589.593 m\mu = 2.02$, or 3 lines.

 The electric field at the third vertex is the sum of the electric fields due to each of the two charges. The electric field due to a charge $q$ at a distance $r$ is given by $E = k \frac{q}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant. Since the charges are both positive, the fields add, so the magnitude of the total electric field is the sum of the magnitudes of the individual fields. The magnitude of the electric field due to one charge is $k \frac{12 \mathrm{nC}}{(2.0 \mathrm{~m})^2} = 3.0 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$. Since there are two charges, the magnitude of the total electric field is $2 \cdot 3.0 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C} = 6.0 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$.

 (a) The ball will rise to its maximum height in 5 seconds, and then fall back down in 5 seconds, so the total time is 10 seconds. The acceleration due to gravity is 32 ft/sec^2, so the initial velocity is 0, and the final velocity is 0. The average velocity is the change in velocity divided by the time, or 0 ft/sec. The average velocity is the initial velocity plus half the acceleration times the time, or 0 ft/sec + 16 ft/sec * 5 sec = 80 ft/sec. The answer is (a) 80 ft/sec. (b) The final velocity is the initial velocity plus the acceleration times the time, or 0 ft/sec + 32 ft/sec * 10 sec = -320 ft/sec. The answer is (b) -320 ft/sec.

 The horizontal component of the stone's velocity remains constant, so the horizontal component of the stone's speed is still 30 m/s. The vertical component of the stone's velocity is given by the equation $v_y = v_0 + g t$, where $v_0$ is the initial vertical velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is the time. Since the initial vertical velocity is 0, the vertical component of the stone's speed is $v_y = g t = 9.8 m/s^2 \times 4 s = 39.2 m/s$. The total speed is the square root of the sum of the squares of the horizontal and vertical components, or $\sqrt{30^2 + 39.2^2} = \sqrt{900 + 1536} = \sqrt{2436} = 49.3 m/s$.

The time it takes for the comet to go from perihelion to aphelion and back to perihelion is the same as the time it takes to go from aphelion to perihelion and back to aphelion. So the orbital period is the sum of the time it takes to go from perihelion to aphelion and the time it takes to go from aphelion to perihelion. The time it takes to go from perihelion to aphelion is the distance from perihelion to aphelion divided by the average speed of the comet.

Since the vessel is filled completely with liquid water, the volume is constant, and the number of moles of gas is constant, so the pressure is proportional to the temperature. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the vessel is much smaller than that of water, so we can ignore the expansion of the vessel.

 (a) The terminal velocity is the velocity at which the force due to gravity is equal to the force due to air resistance. The force due to gravity is $mg$, and the force due to air resistance is $-kv$, so we can set these equal to each other and solve for $v$: \begin{align*}
mg&=-kv\\
\Rightarrow\qquad v&=\frac{mg}{k}=\frac{(0.5)(9.8)}{0.01}=490\text{ m/s}
\end{align*}The answer is not among the options, but we can round to the nearest 100 to get 500 m/s. (b) The maximum height is reached when the potato is momentarily at rest, so the velocity is zero. We can use the equation $v^2=v_0^2-2gh$ to find the maximum height $h$: \begin{align*}
0&=v_0^2-2gh\\
\Rightarrow\qquad h&=\frac{v_0^2}{2g}=\frac{(120)^2}{2(9.8)}=800\text{ m}
\end{align*}The answer is

 In an elastic collision, the total kinetic energy is conserved, so the final kinetic energy of $m_1$ is equal to the initial kinetic energy of $m_2$. Since $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, its final kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the initial kinetic energy of $m_2$ is equal to the initial kinetic energy of $m_1$. Since the initial kinetic energies are equal, we have $\frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2$. Since $u_2 = \alpha u_1$, we have $\frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_2 (\alpha u_1)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \alpha^2 m_2 u_1^2$. Equating the two sides, we have $\frac{m_1}{\alpha^2 m_2} = 1$, or $\alpha^2 = \frac{m_2}{m_1}$. Since $\alpha$ is positive, we have $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{m_

 The beam will spread out due to diffraction, and the spread is inversely proportional to the wavelength and directly proportional to the distance. So the spread is proportional to $\lambda \times d / r$, where $d$ is the distance and $r$ is the initial radius. In our case, the spread is proportional to $694.3 \times 10,000 / 14$, or 4940. The beam will spread out to a diameter of 2 times this, or 9880 m. The answer is not among the options, but the correct answer is 9880 m.

 The gravitational potential energy is given by $W_G = m_1 m_2 / r$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the electron and proton, and $r$ is the distance between them. The electrostatic potential energy is given by $W_E = k e^2 / r$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant and $e$ is the charge of the electron. Plugging in the values, we get $W_G = 8.2 \times 10^{58} J$ and $W_E = 1.99 \times 10^{18} J$.

 The electrical force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F_e = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, and $r$ is the distance between them. The gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of gravity, $F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses, and $r$ is the distance between them. The ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force is then $\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}}{G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}} = \frac{k q_1 q_2}{G m_1 m_2}$. Since the charges are $-e$ and $+e$, and the masses are the same, we have $\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{k e^2}{G m^2

 a) The net rate of heat lost from the warmer surface is the difference between the radiation it emits and the radiation it receives. The radiation it emits is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $E = \sigma T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The radiation it receives is given by the same law, but with the temperature of the cooler surface. The net rate of heat loss is then the difference between these two, or $E - E' = \sigma (T^4 - T'^4)$. Plugging in the given values, we get $E - E' = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} (300^4 - 200^4) = 475$ watts/m^2. b) The temperature of the aluminum foil is the same as the temperature of the surface it is in contact with, which is the cooler surface. So the temperature of the aluminum foil is 200 K. c) The new net rate of loss of heat from the warmer surface is the difference between the radiation it emits and the radiation it receives, but now the radiation it receives is the radiation it emits, since the aluminum foil is a perfect reflector.
