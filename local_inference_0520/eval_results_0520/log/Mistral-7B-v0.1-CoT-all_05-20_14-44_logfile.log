 The Hardy-Weinberg Law states that the genotype frequencies of a population are in equilibrium with the allele frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg Law is expressed as $p^2 + 2 p q + q^2 = 1$, where $p$ is the frequency of the dominant allele, $q$ is the frequency of the recessive allele, and $p^2$, $q^2$, and $2pq$ are the frequencies of dominant homozygous, recessive homozygous, and heterozygous individuals, respectively. ​The frequency of the recessive allele (q) is $\sqrt{0.01} = 0.1$. We have $p = 1 - q = 0.99$. The frequency of heterozygous individuals is $2pq = 2 \cdot 0.99 \cdot 0.1 = 0.198$. The number of heterozygous individuals is equal to the frequency of heterozygous individuals times the size of the population, or $0.198 * 424 = 84$. The

 The lac operon is a genetic switch that controls the production of the enzymes needed to metabolize lactose. The operon is composed of three structural genes, lacZ, lacY, and lacA, which encode the enzymes beta-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase, respectively. The operon also contains a promoter and an operator. The promoter is a DNA sequence that binds RNA polymerase, and the operator is a DNA sequence that binds the repressor protein. The repressor protein is a transcription factor that binds to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter. When lactose is present in the cell, it binds to the repressor protein and causes it to dissociate from the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and transcribe the structural genes. The resulting mRNA is translated into the enzymes needed to metabolize lactose. The lac operon is an example of a negative feedback loop, in which the product of the operon (enzymes) inhibits the production of the operon (enzymes

The probability that his bid is greater than 3c / 4 is 1 - (3c / 4) / (2c) = 1 - 3 / 8 = 5 / 8. The expected profit is 0 if his bid is greater than 3c / 4 and (k - c) if his bid is less than or equal to 3c / 4. The expected profit is therefore (5 / 8) (k - c) + (3 / 8) (0) = (5 / 8) (k - c). The expected profit is maximized when (5 / 8) (k - c) is maximized. The derivative of (5 / 8) (k - c) with respect to k is (5 / 8) - (5 / 8) (c / 8) = (5 / 8) - (c / 8) = (5 - c) / 8.

 The osmotic pressure of a solution is given by the equation:
$Pi = MRT$
Where $Pi$ is the osmotic pressure, $M$ is the molarity, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $M$:

 First, we are given that A is any 20 × 20 array.
Next, we can see that we must compute PD (A, I, J) = [ A(I-1,J) + A(I+1,J) + A(I,J-1) + A(I,J+1)] / 4 to compute our final answer, resulting in a minimum of five clock cycles.
Next, we can see that there is no way to avoid at least one pipeline stall when computing our final answer, because to compute our final sum we must wait at least one cycle for the results from the previous stage to be ready. Thus, our minimum number of cycles must be 6.
We can verify that we can create a solution that requires only six cycles as follows:

 We can see that the score is 6, which means that there are 6 vertices. We can also see that the degree of each vertex is 2, which means that there are 2 edges for each vertex. Thus, there are 6 vertices and 12 edges.
We can see that the graph is connected, so we can use the formula n(n-1)/2 to compute the number of edges in a connected graph with n vertices.
n(n-1)/2 = 6(6-1)/2 = 15
Thus, there are 15 edges in the graph.
We can see that the graph is undirected, so we can use the formula n(n-1)/2 to compute the number of edges in an undirected graph with n vertices.
n(n-1)/2 = 6(6-1)/2 = 15
Thus, there are 15 edges in the graph.
We can see that the graph is simple, so we can use the formula n(n-1)/2 to compute the number of edges in a simple graph with n vertices.

 The capacity of a discrete memoryless channel is given by
$C=\max_{P(X)}I(X;Y)$
where $I(X;Y)$ is the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$.
Since $Y=XZ$, we have
$I(X;Y)=H(Y)-H(Y|X)=H(Y)-H(Z)=H(XZ)-H(Z)$
where $H(Y|X)$ is the conditional entropy of $Y$ given $X$ and $H(Z)$ is the entropy of $Z$.
Since $X$ and $Z$ are independent, we have
$H(XZ)=H(X)+H(Z)$
Thus,
$I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Z)-H(Z)=H(X)$
Since $X$ is a binary random variable, we have
$H(X)=-P(X=0)\log_2P(X=0)-P(X=1)\log_2P(X=1)=-0.5\log_20.5-0.5\log_20.

 The average completion time is the sum of the completion times of all jobs divided by the number of jobs. The completion time of a job is the sum of its service time and the time it waits in the queue. The time a job waits in the queue is the sum of the service times of all jobs that are ahead of it in the queue.
The first job to be completed is the job with a service time of 25. It has no jobs ahead of it in the queue, so it has a completion time of 25. The second job to be completed is the job with a service time of 15. It has one job ahead of it in the queue, so it has a completion time of 15 + 25 = 40. The third job to be completed is the job with a service time of 5. It has two jobs ahead of it in the queue, so it has a completion time of 5 + 40 = 45. The fourth job to be completed is the job with a service time of 3. It has three jobs ahead of it in the queue, so it has a completion time of 3 + 45 = 48. The fifth job

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. We know that the price of A = price of B = $1. We also know that the marginal utility to David Jones of product A is defined by the function, MU_A = 10 - x, where x is the number of units of A pro-duced. For B, MU_B = 21 - 2y, where y is the number of units of B produced. We can solve this problem by using the following formula:
MU_A = MU_B
10 - x = 21 - 2y
10 - 21 = -x - 2y
-11 = -x - 2y
11 = x + 2y
11 - 2y = x
x = 11 - 2y
We know that the price of A = price of B = $1. We can substitute the price of A = price of B = $1 into the equation above to get:
x = 11 - 2y
x = 11 - 2(1)

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. The formula for GNP is:
GNP = C + I + G + (X - M)
The formula for NNP is:
NNP = C + I + G + (X - M) - CCA
The formula for NI is:
NI = NNP + T - TT
We know that:
C = 230.9
I = 63.4
G = 60.6
X = 14.5
M = 17.8
CCA = 12.3
T = 43.0
TT = 14.2
We can calculate GNP, NNP and NI as follows:
GNP = 230.9 + 63.4 + 60.6 + (14.5 - 17.8) = 363.9
NNP = 230.9 + 63.4 + 60.6 + (14.5 - 17.8) - 12.3 = 338.5

So the average velocity of flow is 107,000 ft^3/sec / 0.5027 ft^2, or 213 ft/sec. The power necessary to maintain the oil flow is given by P = Q * deltaP, where deltaP is the pressure drop. So P = 107,000 ft^3/sec * 24,000 lbf/ft^2, or 2.57e+9 ft-lbf/sec. The velocity and shear stress at 3/2 in. from the center are given by v = Q/A

 The heat transfer rate is given by Q = mc \Delta T, where m is the mass flow rate, c is the specific heat, and \Delta T is the temperature change. We have that Q = 125 W/m * 7 mm = 875 W/m, and mc \Delta T = 875 W/m, so c \Delta T = 875 W/m / 4 Kg/hr = 218.75 W/Kg. The specific heat of water is 4186 J/Kg-K, so \Delta T = 218.75 W/Kg / 4186 J/Kg-K = 0.052 K. The temperature at the exit is 340 K + 0.052 K = 340.052 K. The heat transfer rate is given by Q = mc \Delta T, where m is the mass flow rate, c is the specific heat, and \Delta T is the temperature change. We have that Q = 125 W/m * 7 mm = 875 W

 The local convective heat transfer coefficient is given by h = 0.023 (RePr)^0.8, where Re is the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number. The Reynolds number is given by Re = 20 * 2000 / 18 = 1111. The Prandtl number is given by Pr = 0.72. So we have that h = 0.023 * (1111 * 0.72)^0.8 = 1.6. The rate of heat transfer by convection is given by hA(T_s - T_f), where A is the area of the plate, T_s is the temperature of the plate, and T_f is the temperature of the fluid. So we have that hA(T_s - T_f) = 1.6 * 2 * 200 * (200 - 100) = 64,000. The local friction coefficient is given by f = 0.046 / Re^0.2, so we have that f = 0.04

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on chemistry for help. The balanced reaction of ethane gas to carbon dioxide and water is as follows:

 2C2H4 + 3O2 —> 4CO2 + 2H2O

We can see that the reaction requires 3 moles of oxygen for every 2 moles of ethane. Therefore, we can calculate the number of moles of oxygen required by dividing the mass of ethane by the atomic weight of oxygen (16amu).

 84g / 16amu = 5.25 moles of oxygen

We can then calculate the number of moles of carbon dioxide produced by dividing the number of moles of oxygen by 3.

 5.25 moles of oxygen / 3 = 1.75 moles of carbon dioxide

We can then calculate the mass of carbon dioxide produced by multiplying the number of moles of carbon dioxide by the atomic weight of carbon dioxide (44amu).

 1.75 moles of carbon dioxide x 44amu = 7

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on genetics for help. Population carrier screening is a type of genetic screening that is used to identify individuals who carry a genetic mutation that can cause a particular disease. It is typically performed on a large group of people, such as an entire population or a specific ethnic group, to identify carriers of a particular genetic mutation. The goal of population carrier screening is to identify individuals who are at risk of passing on the genetic mutation to their children, so that they can make informed decisions about their reproductive options. Population carrier screening is typically performed for conditions that are relatively common, have a high risk of transmission, and have a significant impact on the health and well-being of affected individuals. Some examples of conditions that are commonly screened for include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and Tay-Sachs disease. However, there are some conditions that are not suitable for population carrier screening, such as Huntington's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene.

 The middle 50 percent of days are the days with the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. The 25th percentile is the value $x$ such that the probability that the number of customers served is less than $x$ is 0.25. The 75th percentile is the value $y$ such that the probability that the number of customers served is less than $y$ is 0.75. The probability that the number of customers served is less than $x$ is the integral of the probability density function of the normal distribution from $-\infty$ to $x$. The probability density function of the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is $f(x)=(1 / \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}) e^{-(x-\mu)^{2} / 2 \sigma^{2}}$. Then the probability that the number of customers served is less than $x$ is

 The rate of flow outward through the cylinder is the integral of the density times the velocity over the cylinder. The density is constant, so we only need to integrate the velocity. The velocity is a function of $x, y$, and $z$, so we need to integrate over the cylinder. The cylinder is the set of points $(x, y, z)$ such that $x^2+y^2=4$ and $0 \leqslant z \leqslant 1$.

There are always 100 gal of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ ounces of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ ounces per gal. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ ounces of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{8} \sin t)-(s /

The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ pounds of salt per minute.

\[kappa = frac{f’’(x)}{(1 + f’(x)^2)^{3/2}}.\]
We have
\[f’(x) = frac{2 - x}{2sqrt{4x - x^2}}\]
and
\[f’’(x) = frac{2 - 2x}{4sqrt{4x - x^2}} - frac{1}{4(4x - x^2)^{3/2}}.\]
Hence
\[kappa = frac{2 - 2x}{4(4x - x^2)^{3/2}} - frac{1}{4(4x - x^2)^{3/2}}.\]
We have $x = 2$, so
\[kappa = frac{2 - 4}{4(4 \cdot 2 - 2^2)^{3/2}} - frac{1}{4(4 \cdot 2 - 2^2)^{3/2}} = frac{1}{4(4 \cdot 2 - 2^2)^{3/2}} = frac{1}{

 We have $a_{n+1} = (1-a_n)^{-1} / 4$. Then $a_{n+1} = 4a_n(1-a_n)^{-1}$. We have $a_n < 1$ and $a_n > 0$, so $a_n < 1-a_n$. Then $a_{n+1} < 4a_n$. Hence $a_{n+1} < a_n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then $a_n$ is a decreasing sequence. Since $a_n < 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the sequence is bounded below by 0. Then $a_n$ converges to some $L \in [0, 1]$. Then $L = (1-L)^{-1} / 4$. Then $L = 4L(1-L)^{-1}$. Then $L = 4L(1-L)$. Then $L = 4L - 4L^2$. Then $L(1+4L) = 4L$. Then $L = 4L /

 Let $s(t)$ denote the number of grams of dye in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 200$. We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution flowing into the tank adds $2 \cdot 1=2$ grams of dye per minute. There are always 200 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of dye. So the density of dye in the tank is $s / 200$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 200)=s / 100$ grams of dye per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2-s) / 100$, and so $[s(t)=1] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

Then $P = 800 / (0.09 e^{0.09 \cdot 20}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.09 e^{1.8}) = 800 / (0.0

 We have
\[x\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2} = \frac{2x\sqrt{6}+4}{\sqrt{x}}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[x^2(3+2\sqrt{2}) = (2x\sqrt{6}+4)^2.\]
Expanding the right side, we get
\[x^2(3+2\sqrt{2}) = 4x^2+16+12x\sqrt{6}.\]
Subtracting $x^2(3+2\sqrt{2})$ from both sides, we get
\[0 = 4x^2+16-12x\sqrt{6}.\]
Dividing both sides by $4$, we get
\[0 = x^2+4-3x\sqrt{6}.\]
Squaring both sides, we get
\[0 = x^4+8x^2-12x\sqrt{6}x^2+36x^2\sqrt{6}.\]
Expanding the right side, we get

 The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that is based on the intermediate value theorem. The algorithm starts with an interval containing the root. It then repeatedly bisects the interval, discarding the half that does not contain the root. The algorithm terminates when the interval is sufficiently small. The bisection method is a robust and reliable algorithm for finding roots of continuous functions. It is guaranteed to converge to the root, and it is not affected by the presence of multiple roots or other complexities in the function. The bisection method is particularly useful for finding roots of functions that are difficult to solve analytically, or for functions that have multiple roots or other complexities.

 Let $x$ be the number of infected people at the end of the week. Then $x = 1200$. Let $y$ be the number of uninfected people at the end of the week. Then $y = 5000 - x = 5000 - 1200 = 3800$. Let $t$ be the number of days it takes for $80 \%$ of the population to become infected. Then $0.8 \cdot 5000 = 4000 = 1200 + x$. Hence $x = 2800$. Then $y = 3800 - x = 3800 - 2800 = 1000$. The rate of spread is jointly proportional to $x$ and $y$. Hence the rate of spread is proportional to $2800 \cdot 1000 = 2800000$. The rate of spread is also proportional to $t$.

 The mass is pulled down an additional 3 in. and then released, and if there is no damping, the position $u$ of the mass at any time $t$ is given by $u(t)=A \cos (\omega t+\phi)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\phi$ is the phase. The initial position of the mass is $u(0)=-3$, and the initial velocity is $u^{\prime}(0)=0$. Then $u(0)=-3=A \cos (\phi)$, and $u^{\prime}(0)=0=-A \omega \sin (\phi)$. Then $\phi=\pi / 2$, and so $u(t)=A \cos (\omega t+\pi / 2)$. Then $u(0)=-3=A \cos (\pi / 2)=0$, and so $A=3$. Then $u(t)=3 \cos (\omega t+\pi / 2)$.

 The P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The test statistic is the t-statistic, which is the ratio of the sample mean to the standard error of the sample mean. The standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size. The sample size is 14, so the standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the sample divided by 2. The standard deviation of the sample is the square root of the sample variance. The sample variance is the sum of the squares of the deviations of the sample observations from the sample mean, divided by the sample size minus 1.

Then $f(10)=2f(8)=2(2f(4))=2(2(2f(2)))=2(2(2(2f(0))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2(2(0.1))))=2(2(2

 The curve is the graph of the function $y = \ln x$. The points where $y = 1/2$ and $y = 1$ correspond to $x = e^{1/2}$ and $x = e$. The length of the curve between these points is
\[
\int_{e^{1 / 2}}^{e} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{d y}{d x}\right)^{2}} d x=\int_{e^{1 / 2}}^{e} \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2}} d x=\int_{e^{1 / 2}}^{e} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x^{2}}} d x .
\]
We use the substitution $u = 1 / x$ to obtain
\[
\int_{e^{1 / 2}}^{e} \sqrt{1+\frac{1}{x^{2}}} d x=\int_{1 / e^{1 / 2}}^{1 / e} \sqrt{1+u^{2}} d u=\int_{1 / e^{1 / 2}}^{1 / e} \sqrt{1+u^{2}} d u

 The solution of the initial value problem is $y(x) = c_1 x + c_2 x^{-1}$. We need to find $\gamma$ so that $y(x)$ is bounded as $x \rightarrow 0$. We have $y^{\prime}(x) = c_1 - c_2 x^{-2}$.

 (a) The terminal velocity is the velocity at which the force of gravity and the air resistance are equal. The force of gravity is $mg$, and the air resistance is $-k m v$. Setting these two forces equal, we get $mg = -k m v$, or $v = -g / k$. The minus sign indicates that the velocity is in the opposite direction of the force of gravity, so the terminal velocity is $g / k$. Plugging in the values, we get $g / k = 9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 / 0.01 \mathrm{~s}^{-1} = 980 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. (b) The maximum height is the height at which the velocity is zero. The velocity is given by $v = v_0 + a t$, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, and $t$ is the time. The acceleration is $a = -g - k v$, and the time is $t = v_0 / a$. Plugging these into the velocity equation, we get $v = v_

 The void ratio is the ratio of the volume of the voids to the volume of the grains, so the volume of the grains is $V_{\text {grains }}=V_{\text {voids }} / e$. The density of the sand is the mass of the grains divided by the volume of the grains, so $\rho_{\text {sand }}=m_{\text {grains }} / V_{\text {grains }}$. The mass of the grains is the mass of the sand minus the mass of the voids, so $m_{\text {grains }}=m_{\text {sand }}-m_{\text {voids }}$. The mass of the voids is the mass of the sand times the void ratio, so $m_{\text {voids }}=m_{\text {sand }} e$. Putting all this together, we get $\rho_{\text {sand }}=m_{\text {sand }}-m_{\text {sand }} e / V_{\text {voids }}$. The mass of the sand is the mass of the grains times the density of the grains, so $m_{\text {sand }}=m_{\text {gr

 The momentum density is the momentum per unit volume, so we need to find the momentum of a single photon and divide by the volume of the beam. The momentum of a photon is $p = E/c = h\nu/c = h/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $\nu$ is the frequency of the photon, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. The volume of the beam is the area of the beam times the distance the beam travels. The area of the beam is the area of the sun, which is about 10000 km in diameter, or $4\pi(10000 km)^2 = 4\pi(10000000 m)^2 = 4\pi(10^9 m)^2$. The distance the beam travels is the distance from the sun to the earth, which is about 150 million km, or $150\times10^6 km = 150\times10^6 m$. The momentum density is thus $h/\lambda$ divided by $4\pi(10^9 m)^2 \times 1

 The force is the mass times the acceleration, and the acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time. The mass is the mass of water, and the time is the distance divided by the speed. The horsepower is the force times the speed divided by 5252. So the force is 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0, 60 mph divided by 400 yd, or 15000 lb times 0

 The heat of fusion of water is 334 J/g, so the heat required to melt the ice is 200 g times 334 J/g, or 66,800 J. The heat capacity of water is 4186 J/g/°C, so the heat required to raise the temperature of the water by 10°C is 500 g times 4186 J/g/°C times 10°C, or 209,300 J. The heat capacity of ice is 2090 J/g/°C, so the heat required to raise the temperature of the ice by 10°C is 200 g times 2090 J/g/°C times 10°C, or 41,800 J.

 The angular momentum is given by $L = mvr$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron, $v$ is the speed of the electron, and $r$ is the distance of the electron from the proton. The total energy is given by $H_0 = mc^2 + KE + PE$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron, $c$ is the speed of light, $KE$ is the kinetic energy of the electron, and $PE$ is the potential energy of the electron. The kinetic energy is given by $KE = mv^2/2$, and the potential energy is given by $PE = -e^2/r$, where $e$ is the charge of the electron. Solving for $r$ in terms of $L$ and $H_0$, we get $r = L^2/m^2c^2$. Substituting in the values for $L$ and $H_0$, we get $r = 1.05 \times 10^{-11} m$.

The work required to move the electron to a position of separation 5 × 10^\rule{1em}{1pt}10 m is given by $W = q_1V$, where $V$ is the potential difference between the two positions.
