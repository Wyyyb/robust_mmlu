 The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal (kidney) glomerular capillaries into the Bowman's capsule per unit time. The GFR is the most direct measure of kidney function. The GFR is determined by the glomerular capillary pressure, the oncotic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary wall, and the hydraulic conductivity of the glomerular capillary wall. The glomerular capillary pressure is determined by the hydraulic pressure of the blood in the glomerular capillaries and the hydraulic pressure in the Bowman's capsule. The hydraulic pressure of the blood in the glomerular capillaries is determined by the hydraulic pressure in the afferent arteriole and the hydraulic pressure in the efferent arteriole.

 Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about twelve hours of fasting in humans). The release of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs, such as the heart, lungs, brain and the rest of the nervous system, liver, kidneys, sex organs, muscles and skin. It is the minimum calorific requirement needed to sustain life. The basal metabolic rate is measured under very restrictive circumstances when a person is awake. An accurate BMR measurement requires that the person's sympathetic nervous system not be stimulated, a condition which requires complete rest. A more common and closely related measurement, used under less strict conditions, is resting metabolic rate (RMR). BMR decreases with age generally, and with the decrease in lean body mass (as may happen with aging). Increasing muscle mass increases BMR. Aerobic fitness level, a product of cardiovascular fitness and muscle fitness, is the largest determinant of an individual's BMR. Thy

New species of animals and plants may arise because some physical separation discontinues the distribution of a species for long periods of time, leading to independent evolution and divergence in their gene pools, ultimately causing two new distinct species to arise. This is correct. New species develop when an existing species is exposed to radiation or chemical pollutants. This is incorrect. New species are formed when individuals of a species adapt to different diets within the same environment. This is incorrect. New species evolve when an existing species undergoes a sudden mutation. This is incorrect. New species evolve when members of a species travel to space and undergo genetic changes due to cosmic radiation. This is incorrect. New species arise due to cross-breeding between existing species. This is incorrect. New species originate exclusively through the process of artificial selection by humans. This is incorrect. New species emerge due to the destruction of a species' habitat, forcing them to adapt to a new habitat or die out. This is incorrect. New species are created through human intervention and genetic modification. This is incorrect. The answer

 The pharynx is a muscular tube that is part of the digestive and respiratory systems. It is located behind the mouth and nasal cavity and above the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx is about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long in adults. The pharynx is divided into three parts: the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The nasopharynx is the uppermost part of the pharynx. It is located behind the nasal cavity and above the soft palate. The oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx. It is located behind the mouth and above the laryngopharynx. The laryngopharynx is the lowermost part of the pharynx. It is located behind the larynx and above the esophagus. The laryngopharynx is the part of the pharynx that is involved in the passage of food and air.

 The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems. It can also be termed as the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiations and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating. The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. The biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).

 Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about 12 hours of fasting). The basal metabolic rate is measured under very restrictive circumstances: a person must be in the post-absorptive state, and have been in bed for at least 12 hours (and preferably in the same position for the entire time). The person must have fasted for 12 hours and not be allowed to smoke or consume caffeinated drinks for at least 12 hours before the measurement. The person must also be at complete rest. In practice, this means that the person is awake but in a completely relaxed state, and can lie down. In most cases, the person is measured in a hospital or a sleep lab, which means that the surroundings are kept at a constant temperature (neutral thermal environment) and the person is not exposed to light, both of which would affect the measurement. The person's body temperature must be kept constant. The person must not have exercised in the hours before the measurement. The person

 The synaptic cleft is a small gap between the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron and the dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron. The synaptic cleft is filled with a fluid that contains neurotransmitters, ions, and other signaling molecules. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic neuron and diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase is found in the synaptic cleft. The chemical agent denatures all enzymes in the synaptic cleft, including the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase is responsible for the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The chemical agent denatures the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, so the neurotransmitter acetylcholine will not be degraded in the synaptic cleft

 The resting potential of a neuron is the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the cell when the neuron is not transmitting an impulse. The resting potential of a neuron is about –70 mV. When a neuron is stimulated, the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the cell changes. This change in voltage is called an action potential. The action potential is a brief change in the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the cell. The action potential is caused by the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The action potential is a brief change in the voltage difference between the inside and the outside of the cell.

The sum-of-the-years-digits method is a depreciation method that results in a more accelerated write-off than the straight-line depreciation method and thus may better reflect the decrease in service utility of an asset. The depreciation rate is determined by multiplying the depreciable cost (original cost less estimated salvage value) by a schedule of fractions. The schedule of fractions is based on the expected life of the asset. The sum of the fractions is equal to the number of years of the asset's useful life. The fraction for each year of the asset's useful life is the sum of the years divided by the sum of the fractions. The depreciation rate for the first year is the fraction for the first year multiplied by 100%. The depreciation rate for the second year is the fraction for the second year multiplied by 100%. The depreciation rate for the third year is the fraction for the third year multiplied by 100%. The depreciation rate for the fourth year is the fraction for the fourth year multiplied by

The contractor's profit is zero if his bid is greater than the low bid, and is the difference between his bid and the cost estimate c if he gets the job. The contractor's expected profit is the probability that his bid is the lowest times the profit if his bid is the lowest. The probability that his bid is the lowest is the probability that the low bid is less than his bid. The probability that the low bid is less than his bid is the probability that the low bid is less than k, which is (k - 3c / 4) / (2c - 3c / 4) = (4k - 3c) / (5c / 2). The probability that his bid is the lowest is (4k - 3c) / (5c / 2). The profit if his bid is the lowest is k - c. The expected profit is (4k - 3c) / (5c / 2) * (k - c).

Presently they charge 25 cents a mile and this results in about 6,000 passengers each day. The managers believe the number of daily passengers will rise by 400 for each 1 cent decrease in the admission charge and drop by 400 for each 1 cent increase. What is the admission charge which maximizes the daily revenue? The revenue is the product of the number of passengers and the admission charge. The number of passengers is a function of the admission charge. The number of passengers is 6000 + 400(25 - x) = 6000 + 10000 - 400x = 16000 - 400x. The revenue is (16000 - 400x)x = 16000x - 400x^2. The maximum revenue is achieved when the derivative of the revenue is zero. The derivative of the revenue is 16000 - 800x = 0.

 The first law of thermodynamics states that $\Delta U = q + w$. Since the process is adiabatic, $q = 0$. The work done by the system is $w = -P_{ext} \Delta V$. The change in volume is $\Delta V = A \Delta x = (10 \mathrm{~cm}^2)(20 \mathrm{~cm}) = 200 \mathrm{~cm}^3 = 0.20 \mathrm{~L}$.

 The work done by the system is equal to the force exerted by the system times the distance the piston moves. The force is equal to the pressure times the area, or $1.0 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot 50 \mathrm{~cm}^2 = 50 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^2$. The distance is $15 \mathrm{~cm}$. The work done is therefore $50 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^2 \cdot 15 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~atm} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^3$. We need to convert this to Joules. We know that $1 \mathrm{~atm} = 101325 \mathrm{~Pa}$, and $1 \mathrm{~Pa} = 1 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^3$.

 The rate constant is given by the Arrhenius equation, $k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$. The rate constant is proportional to the rate of the reaction. We are told that the rate of the reaction doubles when the temperature is increased by 10 degrees. Therefore we can write the following equation: $2k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT_{2}}$. We can divide this equation by the first equation to get $2 = e^{-E_{a}/RT_{2}}/e^{-E_{a}/RT_{1}}$. We can then take the natural log of both sides to get $ln(2) = -E_{a}/RT_{2} + E_{a}/RT_{1}$. We can then solve for $E_{a}$ to get $E_{a} = RT_{1}T_{2}ln(2)/(T_{2} - T_{1})$. We can plug in the values for $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ to get $E_{a} = 1.987 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot 300 \cdot 1000 \cdot ln(2)/(10

 We are given the mass of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. We are asked to find the empirical formula. The empirical formula is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms in a compound. We can find the number of moles of each element by dividing the mass of each element by its molar mass. The molar mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol, the molar mass of hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. The number of moles of carbon is therefore $18.02 / 12.01 = 1.501$. The number of moles of hydrogen is $3.03 / 1.008 = 3.006$. The number of moles of oxygen is $29.05 - 18.02 - 3.03 = 7.99$. We can divide each of these numbers by the smallest number, which is 1.501, to get the empirical formula. The number of moles of carbon is $1.50

Further communications have revealed that the Neptunians know about perfect gas behaviour and they find that, in the limit of zero pressure, the value of $p V$ is $28 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$ and $40 \mathrm{dm}^3$ atm at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$. We can use the ideal gas law to determine the absolute zero of temperature on their temperature scale. The ideal gas law is $p V = n R T$. We can rearrange this to $T = rac{p V}{n R}$. We know that $p = 1$ atm, $V = 28 \mathrm{dm}^3$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and $V = 40 \mathrm{dm}^3$ at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$. We also know that $

 The energy released in a nuclear reaction is equal to the mass defect times the speed of light squared. The mass defect is the difference between the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products. The mass of the reactants is 238.0508 amu, and the mass of the products is 234.0437 + 4.0026 = 238.0463 amu. The mass defect is therefore 238.0508 - 238.0463 = 0.0045 amu. The energy released is therefore 0.0045 amu $\cdot c^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light. The speed of light is $2.998 \cdot 10^8$ m/s, and 1 amu is equal to $1.673 \cdot 10^{-24}$ g.

The balanced equation is $2VO + Fe_2O_3 ightarrow V_2O_5 + 2FeO$. The molar mass of $VO$ is 66.97 g/mol, and the molar mass of $Fe_2O_3$ is 159.69 g/mol. The molar mass of $V_2O_5$ is 181.88 g/mol. We can use the molar masses to find the number of moles of each reactant. We have $2.00 g \cdot rac{1 mol}{66.97 g} = 0.030 g$ of $VO$, and $5.75 g \cdot rac{1 mol}{159.69 g} = 0.036 mol$ of $Fe_2O_3$.

 The electrode potential is given by the Nernst equation, $E = E^0 - 
rac{RT}{nF} ln Q$. Here, $E^0$ is the standard electrode potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient. The reaction quotient is given by $Q = 
rac{[Ag^+]}{[Ag]}$. The concentration of silver is 1 M, and the concentration of silver ion is given by the solubility product constant, $K_{sp} = [Ag^+][Cl^-]$. Therefore, $[Ag^+] = 
rac{K_{sp}}{[Cl^-]} = 
rac{1.8 \cdot 10^{-10}}{1} = 1.8 \cdot 10^{-10}$. The reaction quotient is therefore $Q =

 The capacity of a discrete memoryless channel is given by the maximum mutual information between the input and output of the channel.
The mutual information between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is given by
$I(X;Y)=H(X)-H(X|Y)$
where $H(X)$ is the entropy of $X$ and $H(X|Y)$ is the conditional entropy of $X$ given $Y$.
In this case, the channel is a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability $p=0.5$. The capacity of this channel is given by
$C=1-H(p)$
where $H(p)$ is the binary entropy function.
The binary entropy function is given by
$H(p)=-p\log_2(p)-(1-p)\log_2(1-p)$
Substituting $p=0.5$ into the expression for the capacity of the channel, we get
$C=1-H(0.5)=1-(-0.5\log_2(0.5)-0.5\log_2(0.5))=1-(-0.

The probability that A transmits a frame, B does not transmit a frame, and C does not transmit a frame is equal to the product of the probability that A transmits a frame, the probability that B does not transmit a frame, and the probability that C does not transmit a frame.
The probability that A transmits a frame is p_A.
The probability that B does not transmit a frame is 1 - p_B.
The probability that C does not transmit a frame is 1 - p_C.
Thus, the probability that A transmits a frame, B does not transmit a

 The channel capacity is given by $C = \max_{E(X)^2 \leq P} I(X; Y)$.
We have $I(X; Y) = h(Y) - h(Y|X) = h(Y) - h(Z) = h(Y) - \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi e)$.
Thus, we need to maximize $h(Y)$ subject to $E(Y)^2 \leq 2$.
We have $h(Y) = h(X + Z) = h(X) + h(Z) = h(X) + \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi e)$.
Thus, we need to maximize $h(X)$ subject to $E(X)^2 \leq 2$.
We have $h(X) = \frac{1}{2} \log(2 \pi e \sigma_X^2)$.
Thus, we need to maximize $\sigma_X^2$ subject to $\sigma_X^2 \leq 2$.

 The system is asking for Kerberos KDC server, which is a ticket-granting server. The ticket-granting server is responsible for issuing ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) to users. A TGT is a special type of ticket that allows a user to request additional tickets for specific services.
When a user requests a TGT from the KDC, the KDC verifies the user's identity and generates a TGT that is valid for a certain period of time, typically 24 hours. The TGT is encrypted using the user's password as the key, and is stored on the user's computer.
When the user wants to access a service, they present their TGT to the KDC, which verifies the TGT and issues a service ticket for the requested service. The service ticket is encrypted using the service's key, and is sent to the user. The user then presents the service ticket to the service, which verifies the ticket and grants access to the service.
The maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours for most user principals ensures that the TGT is valid for a reasonable amount of time, but not so long that it becomes a security

 We can see that the recurrence is not in the form of a divide-and-conquer recurrence, so we cannot use the master theorem. However, we can see that the recurrence is in the form of a recurrence that can be solved by repeated substitution.
We can solve the recurrence by repeated substitution as follows:
f(2N + 1) = f(2N) + log N = f(N) + log N + log N = f(N) + 2 log N
f(2N) = f(N) + log N
f(N) = f(N/2) + log (N/2) = f(N/4) + log (N/4) + log (N/2) = f(N/4) + 2 log (N/2)
f(N/2) = f(N/4) + log (N/4)
f(N/4) = f(N/8) + log (N/8)

 We are given that $X$ is uniformly distributed over $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$, where $m=2^n$. We are also given that we ask $n+\sqrt{n}$ random questions, and we want to find the probability of error (one or more wrong objects remaining) when $n$ goes to infinity.
To find the probability of error, we can use Markov's inequality. Markov's inequality states that for a non-negative random variable $X$ and a constant $a>0$, the probability that $X$ is greater than or equal to $a$ is less than or equal to the expected value of $X$ divided by $a$.
In this case, we can define $X$ as the number of wrong objects remaining after asking $n+\sqrt{n}$ random questions. We can then use Markov's inequality to find an upper bound on the probability of error.
To do this, we first need to find the expected value of $X$. Since $X$ is the number of wrong objects remaining, we can think of it as a binomial random variable with $n+\sqrt{n}$ trials and a success probability of $

 The video has a frame resolution of 1920x1080, so each frame has 1920x1080 = 2073600 pixels. Each pixel has 8 bits for each component, so each pixel has 8x3 = 24 bits. Thus, each frame has 2073600x24 = 49766400 bits. Since there are 30 frames/s, the video has 49766400x30 = 1493000000 bits/s.

 The RGB color space is a color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.
The RGB color space is a device-dependent color space: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management.
Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, video game consoles, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays, and large screens such as JumboTron. Color printers, on the other hand, are not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices (typically CMYK color model).

 We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 14. The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize the distance to each node to infinity.
2. Set the distance to the starting node to 0.
3. Repeat the following steps until all nodes have been visited:
a. Find the node with the smallest distance from the starting node.
b. Mark the node as visited.
c. For each unvisited neighbor of the node, update the distance to the neighbor if the new distance is smaller than the current distance.
4. The shortest path from the starting node to any other node is the path that goes through the nodes in the order they were visited.
We can implement this algorithm in Python as follows:
def dijkstra(graph, start):
distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
distances[start] = 0
visited = set()
while visited != set(graph):
current_node = min(distances, key=distances.get)

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Substitution of the CPI values into the equation for the real value of a nominal quantity yields the following:
Real value = Nominal value / (CPI / 100)
We know that the CPI in 1933 was 38.3 and the CPI in 1978 was 200. We also know that Ruth’s salary in 1933 was $80,000. Thus, we have:
Real value = $80,000 / (200 / 100) = $80,000 / 2 = $40,000
We also know that the CPI in 1978 was 200. Thus, we have:

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
a) The point of profit maximization is the point where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost.
The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue that results from the sale of one additional unit of a good or service.
The marginal cost is the change in total cost that results from the production of one additional unit of a good or service.
The marginal revenue is equal to the price of the good or service.
The marginal cost is equal to the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity.
The change in total cost is equal to the change in total revenue minus the change in total cost.
The change in total revenue is equal to the price of the good or service multiplied by the change in quantity.
The change in total cost is equal to the change in total revenue minus the change in total cost.

total of withdrawals = (marginal propensity to consume) * (income tax rate) * (total output)
We know that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.90 and the income tax rate is 0.26; thus, we have:
total of withdrawals = (0.90) * (0.26) * (total output)
We are given the following levels of total output: $ 1,100 billion, 1,050 billion, 1,000 billion, 950 billion, 900 billion. Thus, we have:
total of withdrawals = (0.90) * (0.26) * ($ 1,100 billion) = (0.90) * (0.26) * ($ 1,050 billion) = (0.90) * (0.26) * ($ 1,000 billion) = (0.90) * (0.2

We also know that the standard error for the autocorrelation coefficient is 1 / sqrt(n), where n is the number of observations. Thus, we have:
standard error = 1 / sqrt(250) = 0.0632
We can now calculate the t-statistic for each of the coefficients:
t-statistic for coefficient 1 = 0.2 / 0.0632 = 3.16
t-statistic for coefficient 2 = -0.15 / 0.0632 = -2.37
t-statistic for coefficient 3 = -0.1 / 0.0632 = -1.58
We can see that the t-statistic for coefficient 1 is greater than the critical value of 1.96, so it is statistically significant at the 5% level. The t-statistic for coefficient 2

16.2/3 percent of deposits = 0.162/3 of deposits
0.162/3 of deposits = $100,000
deposits = $100,000 / 0.162/3
deposits = $100,000 / 0.162/3 * 100
deposits = $100,000 / 16.2/3

 The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the air and the water vapor. The partial pressure of the water vapor is given by the saturation pressure at 250 F, which is 124.92 psia. The partial pressure of the air is given by the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles of air, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on nutrition for help. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, food, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first occurs in the liver and converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D deficiency can often be found as a single nutrient deficiency, that is, in an otherwise well-nourished person. The main reason this can happen is because the content of vitamin D in foods depends on the soil in which the food was grown so is not related to wealth or age

The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, which were connected by a common network of trade routes,[1] known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of exchange taking place in the areas near the Ohio River.

Federalist #15 is a document written by Alexander Hamilton in 1787, in which he argued for the adoption of the United States Constitution. The document was part of a series of essays known as the Federalist Papers, which were written to persuade the public to support the ratification of the Constitution. In Federalist #15, Hamilton argued that the Articles of Confederation, which had been the governing document of the United States since 1781, were inadequate and that a stronger national government was necessary to ensure the survival and prosperity of the new nation. He argued that the Articles of Confederation had created a weak and ineffective government that was unable to address the pressing issues facing the country, such as the national debt, the threat of foreign invasion, and the need for a stable currency. Hamilton proposed that the Constitution would create a stronger national government that would be able to address these issues and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the nation. He argued that the Constitution would create a system of checks and balances that would prevent the abuse of power by any one branch of government and that it would protect the rights of the people by establishing a

It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty. The Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was the most populous city in the world in its day. The Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the An Lushan Rebellion and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty maintained a civil service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office.

Following Lord Carnarvon's successful introduction of federation in Canada, it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Sir Henry Bartle Frere was sent to South Africa as High Commissioner for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the South African Republic and the Kingdom of Zululand and its army. Frere, on his own initiative, without the approval of the British government and with the intent of instigating a war with the Zulu, had presented an ultimatum on 11 December 1878, to the Zulu king Cetshwayo with which the Zulu king could not comply. Bartle Frere then sent Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand. The war is notable for several particularly bloody battles, including an opening defeat at the Battle of Isandlw

 We have $f(x) = 2x^3 + e^x - 10$. Then $f'(x) = 6x^2 + e^x$. The Newton-Raphson method is $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$. We have $x_0 = 1$. Then $x_1 = 1 - \frac{f(1)}{f'(1)} = 1 - \frac{2 + e - 10}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6 + e} = 1 - \frac{8 - e}{6

 Let $s(t)$ denote the number of ounces of salt in the tank at time $t$. Then $s(0)=50$. We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution flowing into the tank adds $\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right) \mathrm{oz}$ of salt per minute. There are always 100 gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ ounces of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ ounces per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ ounces of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right)-\left(\frac{s}{50}\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2} \sin t-\frac{s}{5

The solution poured into the tank adds $(1 / 2) 2=1$ pound of salt per minute. There are always $100$ gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ pounds of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ pounds per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ pounds of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=1-(s / 50)=(50-s) / 50$, and so $[s(t)=50] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

 The Graeffe's root squaring method is a method for finding the roots of a polynomial equation. The method is based on the fact that the roots of a polynomial equation are the same as the roots of the equation obtained by squaring the coefficients of the polynomial. The method is as follows:
1. Write the polynomial equation in the form $a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{1} x+a_{0}=0$.
2. Square the coefficients of the polynomial to obtain the equation $a_{n}^{2} x^{2 n}+a_{n-1}^{2} x^{2 n-2}+\cdots+a_{1}^{2} x^{2}+a_{0}^{2}=0$.
3. Solve the equation obtained in step 2 for the roots.
4. The roots of the original equation are the same as the roots of the equation obtained in step 2.
The equation $x^{3}-2 x+2=0$ can be written in the form $x^{3}-2 x+2=0$. Squaring the coefficients of the polynomial, we obtain the equation $x^{6

 The work done is the integral of the force required to lift the coal. The force required to lift the coal is the weight of the coal plus the weight of the cable. The weight of the cable is $2 \mathrm{~lb} / \mathrm{ft}$ times the length of the cable. The length of the cable is the length of the mine shaft plus the length of the coal. The length of the coal is the weight of the coal divided by the density of the coal. The density of the coal is $800 \mathrm{~lb} / 500 \mathrm{~ft}=1.6 \mathrm{~lb} / \mathrm{ft}$.

\|T\|=\sup _{f \in H, f \neq 0} \frac{\|T f\|_{X}}{\|f\|_{H}}=\sup _{f \in H, f \neq 0} \frac{\left\|\int_{0}^{x} f(t) d t\right\|_{X}}{\|f\|_{H}}=\sup _{f \in H, f \neq 0} \frac{\left\|\int_{0}^{x} f(t) d t\right\|_{C[0,2]}}{\|f\|_{L^{1}[0,2]}}

$$
=\sup _{f \in H, f \neq 0} \frac{\max _{x \in[0,2]}\left|\int_{0}^{x} f(t) d t\right|}{\int_{0}^{2}|f(t)| d t} \leq \sup _{f \in H, f \neq 0} \frac{\int_{0}^{2}|f(t)| d t}{\int_{0}^{2}|f(t)| d t}=1

 Let $s(t)$ denote the number of grams of dye in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0)=200$. We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The flow of water into the tank adds $2$ grams of dye per minute. There are always $200$ liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of dye. So the density of dye in the tank is $s / 200$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 200)=s / 100$ grams of dye per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=2-(s / 100)=(200-s) / 100$, and so $[s(t)=200] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{

 Let $P$ be the amount borrowed. The monthly payment is $800$. The interest rate is $9 \%$ per year, so the interest rate per month is $9 / 12 \%$. The amount borrowed is $P$. The amount paid back is $800$ per month. The amount paid back is the interest plus the amount paid back on the principal. The interest is $9 / 12 \%$ per month, so the interest is $9 / 12 \%$ of $P$ per month. The amount paid back on the principal is $800 - 9 / 12 \%$ of $P$. The amount paid back on the principal is $800 - 9 / 12 \%$ of $P$. The amount paid back on the principal is $800 - 9 / 12 \%$ of $P$.

 The two-proportion z-test is used to determine whether the proportions of two groups are different. The null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that the proportions are not equal. The test statistic is $z=\frac{p_{1}-p_{2}}{\sqrt{p(1-p)\left(\frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}\right)}}$, where $p_{1}$ is the proportion of the first group, $p_{2}$ is the proportion of the second group, $p$ is the pooled proportion, $n_{1}$ is the sample size of the first group, and $n_{2}$ is the sample size of the second group. The test statistic is approximately normally distributed. The null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic is greater than the critical value. The critical value is the value of the test statistic that corresponds to a significance level of 0.05. The critical value is $z_{0.05}=1.96$. The test statistic is $z=\frac{0.94-0.71}{\sqrt{0.825(0.

We have $\lfloor\log_{10}(a)+(n-1)\log_{10}(r)\rfloor+1=\lfloor\log_{10}(a)+(n-1)\log_{10}(r)\rfloor+1$.
We have $\lfloor\log_{10}(a)+(n-1)\log_{10}(r)\rfloor+1=\lfloor\log_{10}(a)+(n-1)\log_{10}(r)\rfloor+

 The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. The method is used to find successively better approximations to the root.
The bisection method is a very simple and robust method that is widely used in practice. However, it is relatively slow compared to other methods, as it always requires at least one evaluation of the function per iteration.
The bisection method is based on the intermediate value theorem, which states that if a continuous function f(x) has opposite signs at the endpoints of an interval [a, b], then it must have at least one root in the interval.
The bisection method works as follows:
1. Choose an interval [a, b] such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs.
2. Compute the midpoint of the interval, m = (a + b) / 2.
3. If f(m) = 0, then m is a root of the equation and the algorithm terminates.
4. If f(m) and f(a) have the same sign, then the root must lie

I. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).
This is false. For example, let $T$ be the identity map. Then $U$ is the set of all diagonal matrices, which is a proper subset of $M(V)$.
II. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2
This is true. Let $V$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ over a field $F$. Let $T$ be a linear map from $V$ to $V$. Let $U$ be the set of all linear maps $X$ from $V$ to $V$ such that $TX = XT$. Let $W$ be the set of all linear maps $Y$ from $V$ to $V$ such that $Y = TX - XT$ for some linear map $X$ from $V$ to $V$. Then $U$ and $W$ are subspaces of the vector space of all linear maps from $V$ to $V$. The dimension of the vector space of all linear maps from $V$ to $V$ is $n^{2}$.

 Let $h$ denote the height of the water at time $t$. Then $h(0) = 2$. We use $h$ and $h(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $h^{\prime}$ and $h^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The volume of the water is $V = (π/3)*r^2*h$, where $r$ is the radius of the water. The radius of the water is $r = h/2$. Then $V = (π/3)*(h/2)^2*h = (π/12)*h^3$. The rate of change of the volume of the water is $V^{\prime} = (π/12)*3h^2*h^{\prime} = (π/4)*h^2*h^{\prime}$. The rate of change of the volume of the water is $V^{\prime} = -3$. Then $(π/4)*h^2*h^{\prime} = -3$. Then $h^{\prime} = -12/(π*h^2)$. Then $h^{\prime}(1) = -12/(π*1^2) = -12

 Let $X$ be the random variable that represents the weight of a truck. We have $P(X > 12,000) = 0.7$ and $P(X > 10,000) = 0.8$. Hence $P(10,000 < X < 12,000) = 0.1$. We have $P(X > 10,000) = 0.8 = P(X - 10,000 > 0) = 0.5 + P(X - 10,000 > 10,000)$. Hence $P(X - 10,000 > 10,000) = 0.3$. We have $P(10,000 < X < 12,000) = 0.1 = P(10,000 < X < 12,000) = P(X - 10,000 > 0) - P(X - 10,000 > 10,00

Then $y(t)=(3 a-3) e^{-4 t / 3}+(3-3 a) e^{-t / 3}$. Then $y(t)=3 e^{-t / 3}(a-1)+3 e^{-4 t / 3}(a-1)$. Then $y(t)=3(a-1)\left(e^{-t / 3}+e^{-4 t / 3}ight)$. Then $y(t)>0$ if and only if

 Let $T(t)$ denote the temperature of the coffee at time $t$. Then $T(0)=200$. We have $T^{\prime}(t)=k(T(t)-70)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)=k T(t)-70 k$. We have $T^{\prime}(0)=k T(0)-70 k=k(200-70)=130 k$. Then $T^{\prime}(0)=130 k=10$, so $k=1 / 13$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)=(1 / 13)(T(t)-70)$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)=(1 / 13) T(t)-(70 / 13)$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)-(1 / 13) T(t)=-(70 / 13)$. Then $e^{-t / 13} T^{\prime}(t)-(1 / 13) e^{-t / 13} T(t)=-(70 / 13) e^{-t / 1

 A Type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis, while a Type II error is the non-rejection of a false null hypothesis. In the dialysis center, a Type I error would be to reject the null hypothesis that the equipment is performing satisfactorily when it is actually performing satisfactorily. This would result in the unnecessary recalibration of the equipment, which could be costly and time-consuming. A Type II error would be to not reject the null hypothesis when the equipment is actually not performing satisfactorily. This would result in the continued use of faulty equipment, which could be dangerous for patients. In the towel manufacturer, a Type I error would be to reject the null hypothesis that the towels are the correct size when they are actually the correct size.

 The gravitational force between two objects is given by $F = G M_1 M_2/r^2$, where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the two objects, $r$ is the distance between them, and $G$ is the universal gravitational constant. We can rearrange this to solve for $G$: $G = F r^2/(M_1 M_2)$. The force between the earth and an object on the surface of the earth is given by $F = M g$, where $M$ is the mass of the object and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the earth is given by $M = \rho V$, where $\rho$ is the density of the earth and $V$ is the volume of the earth. The volume of the earth is given by $V = (4/3) \pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the earth. Putting this all together, we have $G = (M g) r^2/(\rho V M) = g r^2/(\rho (4/3) \pi r^3) = 3 g/(4 \

 The heat released by the coal is equal to the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and the water. The heat absorbed by the calorimeter is $m_c c_c \Delta T$, where $m_c$ is the mass of the calorimeter, $c_c$ is the specific heat of the calorimeter, and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change. The heat absorbed by the water is $m_w c_w \Delta T$, where $m_w$ is the mass of the water and $c_w$ is the specific heat of the water. The total heat absorbed is $m_c c_c \Delta T + m_w c_w \Delta T$. The heat released by the coal is $m_c H$, where $m_c$ is the mass of the coal and $H$ is the heat of combustion of the coal. Equating these two expressions, we have $m_c H = m_c c_c \Delta T + m_w c_w \Delta T$. Solving for $H$, we have $H = c_c \Delta T + m_w c_w \Delta T / m_c

 The energy equivalent of a particle is given by $E = mc^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $c$ is the speed of light. The mass of a particle is given in amu, which is a unit of mass equal to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The mass of a carbon-12 atom is 12 amu, so the mass of a particle is $m = 1 amu = 1/12 \times 12 amu = 1 amu$. The speed of light is $c = 3 \times 10^8 m/s$. So the energy equivalent of a particle is $E = mc^2 = 1 amu \times (3 \times 10^8 m/s)^2 = 9 \times 10^{16} amu \times m^2/s^2$. To convert this to MeV, we need to know the conversion factor between amu and MeV. This is given by $1 amu = 931 MeV$, so the energy equivalent of a particle is $E = 9 \times 10

 The number of atoms in a droplet of water is the number of atoms per cubic centimeter times the volume of the droplet. The number of atoms per cubic centimeter is Avogadro's number divided by the molar mass of water, or $6.02 \times 10^{23} / 18 = 3.3 \times 10^{22}$. The volume of the droplet is $\pi/6 \times 0.1^3 = 5.2 \times 10^{-5}$. So the number of atoms in the droplet is $3.3 \times 10^{22} \times 5.2 \times 10^{-5} = 1.7 \times 10^{18}$. At a rate of 5 atoms per second, it would take $1.7 \times 10^{18} / 5 = 3.4 \times 10^{17}$ seconds to count all the atoms. This is $3.4 \times 10^{17} / 3.15 \times 10^7 = 1.1 \times

 The mean angle of deviation is given by $\delta = (n-1)A$, where $n$ is the index of refraction and $A$ is the apex angle. So we have $\delta_D = (1.508-1)A$ and $\delta_D' = (1.620-1)A'$. Since $\delta_D = \delta_D'$, we have $(1.508-1)A = (1.620-1)A'$, or $A = 1.08A'$. Since $A' = 10.0^\circ$, we have $A = 10.8^\circ$.

 The entropy change is given by the integral of dQ/T, where dQ is the heat added to the system. For an ideal gas, the heat added is given by the first law of thermodynamics, dQ = dU + PdV, where dU is the change in internal energy and PdV is the work done by the gas. For an ideal gas, the internal energy is given by U = (3/2)NkT, where N is the number of molecules and k is Boltzmann's constant. The work done by the gas is PdV, where P is the pressure. Since the pressure is constant, the work done is P(V_2 - V_1). The temperature is given by T = PV/Nk, where V is the volume. Putting all this together, we get dQ = (3/2)Nk dT + PdV = (3/2)Nk dT + P(V_2 - V_1). The integral of dQ/T is then (3/2)Nk ln (T_2/T_1) + P(V_2 - V_1)/T

 The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave due to the relative motion of the source and the observer. The frequency of the sound is increased if the source is moving towards the observer, and decreased if the source is moving away from the observer.

The amount of the decrease is given by the formula $f = f_0 \sqrt{(v-v_s)/(v-v_o)}$, where $f$ is the observed frequency, $f_0$ is the emitted frequency, $v$ is the speed of sound, $v_s$ is the speed of the source, and $v_o$ is the speed of the observer.

 The volume of air in the tire is 1500 in^3, and the pressure is 20 lb/in^2. The total force on the tire is the pressure times the area, or 20 lb/in^2 times the area of the tire. The area of the tire is the volume divided by the height of the tire, or 1500 in^3 divided by the height of the tire. So the total force on the tire is 20 lb/in^2 times 1500 in^3 divided by the height of the tire. The pressure is the total force divided by the area, so the pressure is 20 lb/in^2 times 1500 in^3 divided by the height of the tire divided by the area of the tire. The area of the tire is the volume divided by the height of the tire, so the pressure is 20 lb/in^2 times 1500 in^3 divided by the height of the tire divided by 1500 in^3 divided by the height of the tire. The height of the tire cancels out, so the pressure is 20 lb/in^2

 The momentum of the bullet is its mass times its velocity, and the momentum of the rifle is its mass times its velocity. Since the rifle and bullet are moving in opposite directions, the total momentum of the system is the momentum of the bullet minus the momentum of the rifle. Since the rifle and bullet are not moving before the shot, the total momentum of the system is zero. Thus, the momentum of the bullet must equal the momentum of the rifle. The mass of the bullet is 1 ounce, or 1/16 pound, and the mass of the rifle is 7 pounds, so the velocity of the rifle must be 1/16 of the velocity of the bullet.

 The comet's orbit is a parabola, so the comet's speed is constant. The time it spends within Earth's orbit is the time it takes to travel from the point where it is closest to the Sun to the point where it is farthest from the Sun. The distance between these two points is $2 \beta r_E$, so the time is $2 \beta r_E / v$, where $v$ is the comet's speed. The comet's speed is given by the vis-viva equation, $v^2 = G M / r$, where $M$ is the mass of the Sun and $r$ is the distance from the Sun. The distance from the Sun is $r = \beta r_E$ at the point of closest approach, and $r = (1+\beta) r_E$ at the point of farthest approach. So the speed is $v = \sqrt{G M / \beta r_E}$ at the point of closest approach, and $v = \sqrt{G M / (1+\beta) r_E}$ at the point of farthest approach. The time is thus $2 \beta

 (a) The condensing lens forms an image of the filament which just fills the projection lens. The projection lens is 1.25 inches in diameter, and the filament is 0.25 inches in diameter, so the magnification of the condensing lens is 1.25/0.25 = 5. The focal length of the condensing lens is 1 inch, so the image of the filament is 5 inches from the condensing lens. The projection lens is 1.25 inches in diameter, so the image of the filament is 1.25 inches in diameter. The focal length of the projection lens is the distance from the image of the filament to the projection lens, or 1.25 inches. (b) The image of the slide is formed by the projection lens. The magnification of the projection lens is the ratio of the image size to the object size, or 1.25 inches/1 inch = 1.25.

 The angular separation between the central and 20th order is 15°10' = 15.167°. The angular separation between the central and first order is 1°, so the angular separation between the central and 20th order is 20 times the angular separation between the central and first order. The angular separation between the central and first order is given by the grating equation, $\sin \theta = \lambda/d$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the central and first order, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light, and $d$ is the spacing between the grating elements. So the angular separation between the central and 20th order is $20 \lambda/d$. We know that the angular separation between the central and 20th order is 15.167°, so $20 \lambda/d = 15.167°$.

 The object appears to be closer because the light rays are bent by the glass. The amount of bending is given by the formula $n \sin \theta_1 = \sin \theta_2$, where $n$ is the index of refraction of the glass, $\theta_1$ is the angle of the light ray with the normal to the glass, and $\theta_2$ is the angle of the light ray with the normal to the air. Since the light ray is bent towards the normal, the apparent distance to the object is less than the actual distance by the amount of the bending. The amount of bending is given by the difference in the angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. The sine of the angle $\theta_1$ is the ratio of the thickness of the glass to the distance to the object, and the sine of the angle $\theta_2$ is the ratio of the thickness of the glass to the apparent distance to the object. The difference in the angles is thus the difference in the ratios, which is the thickness of the glass divided by the distance to the object.

 The specific rotation is defined as $\beta = \frac{180}{\pi} \frac{n_L - n_R}{n} \frac{L}{\lambda}$, where $n_L$ and $n_R$ are the refractive indices for left and right circularly polarized light, $n$ is the average refractive index, $L$ is the thickness of the sample, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. In our case, we are given $\beta$, $L$, and $\lambda$, and we are asked to find $n_L - n_R$. So we can rearrange the equation to solve for $n_L - n_R$, and we get $n_L - n_R = \frac{\pi}{180} \frac{n \beta \lambda}{L}$. The average refractive index $n$ is 1.544 for quartz at 508.582 nm.

 The entropy change is the change in the entropy of the hot water minus the change in the entropy of the cold water. The entropy of the hot water is $S = C \ln(T_f/T_i)$ where $C$ is the heat capacity of the water, $T_i$ is the initial temperature, and $T_f$ is the final temperature. The entropy of the cold water is the same, but with the initial and final temperatures reversed. The change in entropy of the hot water is $C \ln(T_f/T_i)$ and the change in entropy of the cold water is $C \ln(T_i/T_f)$. The total change in entropy is $C \ln(T_f/T_i) - C \ln(T_i/T_f) = C \ln(T_f/T_i)^2$. The heat capacity of water is 1 cal/g/deg, so the total change in entropy is $100 \ln(273/278)^2 + 50 \ln(278/273)^2 = 0.1$ cal/K/deg

 The ball is thrown upward, so it is slowing down. The ball will reach its maximum height when its speed is zero. The time it takes to reach its maximum height is half the time it takes to reach the ground. The time it takes to reach the ground is the time it takes to fall from rest, which is $t = \sqrt{2h/g}$ where $h$ is the height and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. So the time to reach the ground is $\sqrt{2h/g}$ and the time to reach the maximum height is half that, or $\sqrt{h/2g}$. The maximum height is the initial speed times the time to reach the maximum height, or $h = v_0 \sqrt{h/2g}$. So the maximum height is $h = v_0^2/2g = (80 ft/sec)^2/2(32 ft/sec^2) = 100 ft$. The time to reach the maximum height is $\sqrt{h/2g} = \sqrt{100 ft/2(32 ft/sec^2)} = 1.7 sec$. The time to reach the ground is

 The half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years, so the time it takes for the number of carbon-14 nuclei to decay by a factor of 2. The number of carbon-14 nuclei in the sample is proportional to the number of decays per second, so the time it takes for the number of carbon-14 nuclei to decay by a factor of 2 is also 5730 years. The number of carbon-14 nuclei in the sample from the stone age culture is 9.4 × 10^2, and the number of carbon-14 nuclei in the sample from living material is 1.5 × 10^4. The number of times the number of carbon-14 nuclei has to be halved to get from 1.5 × 10^4 to 9.4 × 10^2 is 4.6, so the time it takes for the number of carbon-14 nuclei to decay by a factor of 4.6 is 4.6 times 5730 years, or 2.6 × 10^4 years.

 The ice cube will melt, and the water will cool down. The amount of heat required to melt the ice is the latent heat of fusion of water, which is 334 J/g. The amount of heat required to cool the water from 20°C to 0°C is the specific heat of water times the mass of water times the temperature difference, or 4.18 J/g/°C times 500 g times 20°C, or 41800 J. The total amount of heat required is 33400 J + 41800 J, or 75200 J. The amount of heat available from the water is the specific heat of water times the mass of water times the temperature difference, or 4.18 J/g/°C times 500 g times 20°C, or 41800 J. Since the amount of heat available is less than the amount of heat required, the ice will not completely melt. The amount of heat available is enough to melt 75 g of ice, and the water will cool down to 0°C. The answer is

 The total energy of the electron is given by the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, or $H_0 = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}$. The angular momentum is given by $L = mvr$, so we can solve for the velocity $v = L/mr$. Plugging this into the energy equation, we get $H_0 = \frac{1}{2}m(L/mr)^2 - \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}$. We can solve this for $r$ to get $r = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 H_0} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 H_0})^2 - \frac{2L^2}{mH_0}}$. Plugging in the values for $H_0$ and $L$, we get $r = 1.05 \times 10^{-11} m$ and $r = 4.71 \times 10^{-11}

 The net rate of heat loss from the warmer surface is the difference between the rate of heat loss from the warmer surface and the rate of heat gain from the cooler surface. The rate of heat loss from the warmer surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma T^4 A$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin, and $A$ is the area of the surface. The rate of heat gain from the cooler surface is the same, but with the temperature of the cooler surface. The difference is $P = \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4) A$. The temperature of the aluminum foil is the temperature at which the rate of heat loss from the warmer surface equals the rate of heat gain from the cooler surface, so $P = \sigma (T_1^4 - T_f^4) A = \sigma (T_f^4 - T_2^4) A$. Solving for $T_f$, we get $T_f = (T_1^4 - T_2^4)^{1/4}$.
