 Prokaryotic cells are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. They are found in all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells, and they have a cell wall that surrounds the cell membrane. The cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, a polymer of sugars and amino acids. The cell wall helps to maintain the cell's shape and protect it from damage. Prokaryotic cells also have a plasma membrane, which is a thin layer of phospholipids that surrounds the cell and controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. The plasma membrane is responsible for the transport of nutrients and waste products across the cell membrane. Prokaryotic cells also have ribosomes, which are small organelles that are responsible for protein synthesis. Ribosomes are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but they are much smaller in prokaryotic cells.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on finance for help. The formula for calculating the present value of an annuity is: PV = C x [ (1 - (1 + r)^(-n)) / r ] where C is the payment amount, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of payments. The formula for calculating the present value of a lump sum is: PV = F x (1 + r)^(-n) where F is the future value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods. In this case, the present value of the lump sum is $720, the interest rate is 8%, and the number of periods is 12. Therefore, the present value of the lump sum is $720 x (1 + 0.08)^(-12) = $720 x 0.64 = $460.80. The present value of the annuity is $65 x [ (1 - (1 + 0.08)^(-12)) / 0.08 ] = $65 x 0.64 = $41.60. Therefore, the difference between the present value of the lump sum and the present value of the annuity is $460.80 - $41.60 = $

 The first thing to do is to compute the change in internal energy. The change in internal energy is equal to the heat added to the system, $q$, minus the work done by the system, $w$. The work done by the system is equal to $-P \Delta V$. The change in volume is equal to the change in temperature times the constant volume heat capacity, $C_v$, divided by the gas constant, $R$. The change in internal energy is therefore equal to $q - P \Delta V = q - P \frac{C_v \Delta T}{R}$. The change in internal energy is equal to zero, since the process is adiabatic. Therefore $q = P \frac{C_v \Delta T}{R}$. The pressure is equal to the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$. Therefore $q = \frac{nRT}{V} \frac{C_v \Delta T}{R}$. The change in temperature is equal to $250 - 200 = 50 \mathrm{K}$. The number of moles is equal to $3.00 \mathrm{~mol}$. The volume is equal to $nRT/P$. The volume is equal to $3.00

 We are given the balanced equation for the reaction. We can use this equation to compute the amount of reactants and products. (A) We are asked to compute the amount of BaCl2 that is needed to react with 10 grams of Fe2(SO4)3. We can use the balanced equation to compute the amount of BaCl2 that is needed. The balanced equation is $Fe_2 (SO_4)_3 + 3BaCl_2 \rightarrow 3BaSO_4\downarrow + 2FeCl_3$. The molar mass of Fe2(SO4)3 is 238.77 g/mol.

 The first step is to balance the equations. The first equation is already balanced. The second equation is balanced as is. The third equation is not balanced. We need to add 2 H2O to the left side to balance the oxygen atoms. The resulting equation is $CaCO_3 + 2H_2SO_3\rightarrow Ca(HSO_3)_2 + CO_2 + 2H_2O$. The first step is to determine the amount of sulfur required. We have 250 kg of CaCO_3. The equation shows that 2 moles of H2SO3 are required for every mole of CaCO_3. The molar mass of CaCO_3 is 100.09 g/mol. Therefore the amount of CaCO_3 is 250 kg / 100.09 g/mol = 2.50 mol. The amount of H2SO3 required is 2.50 mol * 2 = 5.00 mol. The molar mass of H2SO3 is 82.07 g/mol. Therefore the amount of sulfur required is 5.00 mol * 82.07 g/mol = 410.35 g = 0.41035 kg. The second step

 The energy of the photon is equal to the energy difference between the two states. The energy of the photon is equal to $h \nu$. The energy of the electron in the ground state is equal to $E_{1} = \frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$, where $L$ is the length of the box. The energy of the electron in the first excited state is equal to $E_{2} = \frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} + \frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} = \frac{2 h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$. The energy difference is therefore equal to $E_{2} - E_{1} = \frac{2 h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} - \frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}} = \frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$.

The uncertainty in the position of the electron is 20 pm, or $2.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}$. The uncertainty in the momentum is therefore $\Delta p = \frac{h}{4 \pi \Delta x} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{s}}{4 \pi \cdot 2.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}} = 5.2 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

 The first thing to do is to compute the change in internal energy. The change in internal energy is equal to the heat added to the system, which is zero, minus the work done by the system, which is equal to $P \Delta V$. The change in internal energy is therefore equal to $P \Delta V$. The work done by the system is equal to $P \Delta V$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\Delta V$ is the change in volume. The pressure is equal to $nRT/V$, where $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $V$ is the volume. The change in volume is equal to $V_{2} - V_{1}$, where $V_{1}$ is the initial volume and $V_{2}$ is the final volume. The change in internal energy is therefore equal to $nRT(V_{2} - V_{1}) / V_{2}$. The change in internal energy is equal to the change in enthalpy, which is equal to $nC_{V} \Delta T$.

 The vapor pressure of the solution is lower than that of the pure solvent. This is because the solute is non-volatile. The vapor pressure of the solution is therefore equal to the vapor pressure of the solvent minus the amount of vapor pressure that is lost due to the presence of the solute. The amount of vapor pressure lost is equal to the mole fraction of the solute multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. The mole fraction of the solute is equal to the mass of the solute divided by the total mass of the solution. The mole fraction of the solute is therefore equal to $$frac{3.68}{3.68 + 53.0} = 0.0657$$. The vapor pressure lost is therefore equal to $0.0657 \cdot 640 = 42.1$ torr.

 We are given the initial and final temperature and volume of the system. We are also given the amount of heat added to the system. We are asked to compute the change in enthalpy. We can use the van der Waals equation of state to compute the change in internal energy. The van der Waals equation of state is $$

The heat released by the water is 500 g x 1 cal/g°C x 0°C = 0 cal. The heat released by the ice is 500 g x 1 cal/g°C x 0°C = 0 cal. The heat released by the mixture is 500 g x 1 cal/g°C x 0°C = 0 cal. The heat released by the mixture is 500 g x 1 cal/g°C x 0°C = 0 cal.

 The first thing to do is to compute the work done by the gas. The work done by the gas is equal to the change in internal energy, \DeltaE, which is equal to the change in enthalpy, \DeltaH, for an ideal gas. The work done by the gas is equal to the change in pressure times the change in volume, or $w = P \DeltaV$. The change in volume is equal to the initial volume minus the final volume, or $- 2.00 \cdot 3.00 = - 6.00 L$. The change in pressure is equal to the final pressure minus the initial pressure, or $90.0 - 2.00 = 88.0 atm$. The work done by the gas is therefore $w = 88.0 \cdot - 6.00 = - 528.0 L \cdot atm$. The work done by the gas is equal to the change in internal energy, \DeltaE, which is equal to the change in enthalpy, \DeltaH, for an ideal gas.

We can use the Arrhenius equation to compute the activation energy. $k = A e^{-E_{a}/RT}$. We can take the natural log of both sides to get $ln(k) = ln(A) - E_{a}/RT$.

 The entropy of a discrete random variable X is defined as $H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log_2 p(x)$, where $p(x)$ is the probability of the event $x$. In this case, $X$ is a non-negative integer-valued random variable, so we can write $X = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}$. Since $E(X) = 1$, we have $\sum_{x \in X} x p(x) = 1$, which implies that $p(0) = 0$ and $p(x) = \frac{1}{x+1}$ for $x \geq 1$. Therefore, $H(X) = -\sum_{x \geq 1} \frac{1}{x+1} \log_2 \frac{1}{x+1} = -\sum_{x \geq 1} \frac{\log_2 (x+1)}{x+1} = -\sum_{x \geq 1} \frac{\log_2 (x+1)}{x+1} = -\sum_{x \

 We can use the following formula to compute the number of labelled forests on n vertices with k connected components:
n! / (n-k)! * k!
Thus, the number of labelled forests on 10 vertices with 5 connected components is:
10! / (10-5)! * 5! = 10! / 5! * 5! = 10! / 5!^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 5^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 5^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 5^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 5^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / 5^2 = 10 * 9 * 8 *

 The phishing attack is a type of social engineering attack, which is an attempt to trick a user into giving up sensitive information. The phishing attack is usually done by sending an email that looks like it is from a legitimate source, such as a bank or a government agency. The email will usually contain a link that the user is asked to click on, which will take them to a fake website that looks like the real website. The user will then be asked to enter their sensitive information, such as their username and password. The phishing attack is a very effective way to steal sensitive information, and it is important to be aware of the signs of a phishing attack. One of the signs of a phishing attack is an email that asks you to enter your date of birth and social security number for verification purposes.

 The capacity is the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted reliably. The capacity is given by the following formula:
$C = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} I(X^n; Y^n)$
where $X^n$ is the input sequence and $Y^n$ is the output sequence. In this case, the input sequence is $X_i = \frac{1}{i}X_i + Z_i$ and the output sequence is $Y_i = \frac{1}{i}X_i + Z_i$. The mutual information between the input and output sequences is given by the following formula:
$I(X^n; Y^n) = H(Y^n) - H(Y^n|X^n)$

$C = \max_{p_X} I(X;Y) = \max_{p_X} H(Y) - H(Z) = \max_{p_X} H(X+Z) - H(Z)$
where $Z \sim N(0, 1)$ and $X$ is independent of $Z$. Since $H(X+Z) = H(Z) + \frac{1}{2} \log_2(1 + \frac{E(X+Z)^2}{\sigma_Z^2}) = H(Z) + \frac{1}{2} \log_2(1 + \frac{E(X)^2}{\sigma_Z^2}) = H(Z) + \frac{1}{2} \log_2(1 + \frac{P}{\sigma_Z^2})$, we have
$C = \max_{p_X} H(Z) + \frac{1}{2} \log_2(1 + \frac{P}{\sigma_Z^2}) - H(Z) = \frac{1}{2} \log_2(1 + \frac{P}{\sigma_Z^2}) = \frac{1

 The code segment is as follows:
IF (a = 0)
{

}
ELSE
{

}
The first conditional IF (a = 0) is true if a is 0, and false otherwise. If the conditional is true, the command b ← a + 10 is executed, and if the conditional is false, the command b ← a + 20 is executed. Thus, the value of b is 10 if a is 0, and 20 otherwise.
Changing line 3 to b ← 10 will not affect the results, because the value of b is 10 if a is 0, and 20 otherwise, regardless of the value of b.

The EY procedure is an extension of the Engle-Granger (EG) approach to cointegration. The EY procedure is designed to overcome the limitations of the EG approach. The EY procedure is a two-step procedure. In the first step, the EY procedure estimates the cointegrating relationship using the EG approach. In the second step, the EY procedure tests for cointegration using the estimated cointegrating relationship. The EY procedure is a more powerful test for cointegration than the EG approach. The EY procedure is also more robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. The EY procedure is a more efficient test for cointegration than the EG approach.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on corporate finance for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. We know that the corporation income tax rate is 48%. The net income is equal to the following:
net income = sales - cost of goods sold - administrative expenses - depreciation - all other expenses
We know that the sales are $3,000,000; the cost of goods sold is $1,500,000; administrative expenses are $300,000; depreciation is $800,000; and all other expenses are $100,000. Thus, we have:
net income = $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 - $300,000 - $800,000 - $100,000 = $1,000,000
We know that the corporation income tax rate is 48%. Thus, the tax is equal to the following:
tax = 0.48 * $1,000,000 = $480,000
We know that the retained earnings are $100,000. Thus, the dividend is equal to the following:
dividend = net income - tax - retained earnings
We have:
dividend = $1,000,000 - $480,000 - $100,000 = $420,000

If the security is due next year and the yield is 9%, then the price of the security is equal to the present value of the annual coupon payment and the maturity value, which is equal to:
price = (annual coupon payment) / (1 + yield) + (maturity value) / (1 + yield)2
We know that the annual coupon payment is $ 5,000, the yield is 9%, and the maturity value is $ 100,000; thus, we have:
price = ($ 5,000) / (1 + 0.09) + ($ 100,000) / (1 + 0.09)2
= ($ 5,000) / 1.09 + ($ 100,000) / 1.09 2
= $ 4,587.16 + $ 94,175.23
= $ 98,762.39

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. We have the following demand function and total cost function:
P = 15 - . 05q
TC = q + .02q^2
a) We need to find the point of profit maximization. We know that the profit function is given by:
profit = P * q - TC
We can substitute the demand function and total cost function into the profit function to get:
profit = (15 - . 05q) * q - (q + .02q^2)
profit = 15q - . 05q^2 - q - .02q^2
profit = 14q - . 12q^2
We can take the first derivative of the profit function with respect to q to get:
dprofit / dq = 14 - . 24q
We can set the first derivative equal to zero to get:
14 - . 24q = 0
14 = . 24q
q = 14 / . 24
q = 58
We can substitute the value of q into the profit function to get:
profit = 14(58) - . 12(58

If Mr. Balfour has $1,000 which he wishes to invest, he is having trouble choosing between tax-free municipal bonds which pay 6% interest and a savings account which pays 8% interest. If Mr. Balfour has a marginal tax rate of 30%, where should he invest his money? We know that the marginal tax rate is 30%. We also know that the interest rate of the municipal bonds is 6% and the interest rate of the savings account is 8%. We can calculate the after-tax interest rate of the municipal bonds as follows: after-tax interest rate of the municipal bonds = (1 - marginal tax rate) * interest rate of the municipal bonds = (1 - 0.3) * 0.06 = 0.42 = 42% We can calculate the after-tax interest rate of the savings account as follows: after-tax interest rate of the savings account = (1 - marginal tax rate) * interest rate of the savings account = (1 - 0.3) * 0.08 = 0.56 = 56% We can see that the after-tax interest rate of the

Quantity Price 1 109 2 105 3 100 4 96 5 91
We are asked to calculate the profit without price discrimination and the profit with price discrimination. We know that the profit without price discrimination is equal to the following:
profit without price discrimination = (total revenue) - (total costs)
We know that the total revenue is equal to the following:
total revenue = (price) * (quantity)
We know that the total costs are equal to the following:
total costs = (fixed costs) + (variable costs)
We know that the fixed costs are equal to $405. We know that the variable costs are equal to the following:
variable costs = (price) * (quantity)
We know that the quantity is 5 units. Thus, we have:
variable costs = (price) * (quantity) = (91) * (5) = 455
Thus, we have:
total costs = (fixed costs) + (variable costs) = 405 + 455 = 860
We know that the price is 91. Thus, we have:

We also know that the total of withdrawals from the economic income- expenditure circuit is equal to the following:
total of withdrawals from the economic income- expenditure circuit = (marginal propensity to consume) * (total output) + (income tax rate) * (total output)
We know that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.90 and the income tax rate is 0.26; thus, we have:
total of withdrawals from the economic income- expenditure circuit = (0.90) * (total output) + (0.26) * (total output)
We can simplify this equation as follows:
total of withdrawals from the economic income- expenditure circuit = 1.16 * (total output)
We know that the total output is $ 1,100 billion, $ 1,050 billion, $ 1,000 billion, $ 950 billion, and $ 900 billion; thus, we have:

Number of men hired Total Physical Product (in tons per day) 1 15 2 25 3 33 4 38 5 42
and the information that wages are $50/day and output sells for $10 a ton. We are asked to find how many men Mr. Falbowill hire in order to maximize profits. We know that the profit is equal to the total physical product minus the total cost. The total cost is equal to the number of men hired multiplied by the wage rate. Thus, the profit is equal to the total physical product minus the number of men hired multiplied by the wage rate. We can write the profit as follows:
Profit = Total Physical Product - Number of men hired multiplied by the wage rate
We know that the total physical product is equal to the number of men hired multiplied by the total physical product per man. Thus, we can write the profit as follows:
Profit = Number of men hired multiplied by the total physical product per man - Number of men hired multiplied by the wage rate

We know that the total profit function equation is: Total Profit = \pi = - $3,000 - $2,400 Q + $350Q^2 - $8.333Q^3. a) Compute the marginal profit. We know that the marginal profit is the first derivative of the total profit function. We have: \pi' = - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2. b) Determine its output quantities. We know that the output quantities are the values of Q that make the marginal profit equal to zero. We have: \pi' = - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2 = 0. We solve this equation for Q. We have: - $2,400 + $700Q - $25Q^2 = 0. We add $2,400 to both sides of the equation. We have: $700Q - $25Q^2 = $2,400. We divide both sides of the equation by $25. We have: $28Q - Q^2 = 96.

 The work done is given by the integral of PdV, where P is the pressure and V is the volume. The pressure is given by PV^1.3 = C, so P = C/V^1.3. Plugging this into the integral, we get that the work done is C(1/1.3) * (V_2^1.3 - V_1^1.3). The heat transferred is given by the integral of dQ = dU + dW, where dU is the change in internal energy.

 The available energy is given by h_1 - h_2, where h_1 and h_2 are the enthalpies at the inlet and outlet, respectively. The enthalpy is given by h = c_p T, where c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure. So we have that h_1 = 1.005 * 825 = 841.25 kJ/kg, and h_2 = 1.005 * 585 = 585.75 kJ/kg.

 The first step is to find the quality of the mixture. The quality is defined as the mass of vapor divided by the total mass. The quality is given by the ratio of the partial pressure of the vapor to the total pressure. The partial pressure of the vapor is given by the vapor pressure of water at 100 lbf/in^2, which is 0.98 lbf/in^2. So the quality is 0.98/100 = 0.0098. The next step is to find the mass of the liquid. The mass of the liquid is given by the total mass minus the mass of the vapor. The mass of the vapor is given by the quality times the total mass. So the mass of the liquid is 30 - 0.0098*30 = 29.7 lbm. The next step is to find the volume of the liquid. The volume of the liquid is given by the mass of the liquid divided by the density of the liquid. The density of the liquid is given by the mass of the liquid divided by the volume of the liquid.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on Rawls for help. Rawls' theory of justice is based on the idea of the original position, which is a hypothetical situation in which people choose the principles of justice for society. The original position is a state of nature in which the parties are deprived of any information about their particular identities, including their race, gender, religion, social class, and wealth. The parties are also deprived of any information about the particular circumstances of society, such as the level of social and economic development or the economic and natural resources of the society. The only information that the parties have is the general facts about human society. The parties are rational and self-interested, but they are also reasonable in the sense that they are willing to cooperate with others to achieve their goals. In the original position, the parties are asked to choose the principles of justice that will govern society. Rawls argues that the parties will choose two principles of justice: the principle of equal liberty and the difference principle. The principle of equal liberty states that all citizens have an equal right to basic liberties, such as freedom of speech, religion, and association. The difference principle states that social and economic inequalities are justified only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. Rawls argues that

 We know that the hypotenuse of a right triangle measures 10 inches and one angle is $45^{\circ}$. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the other side. The Pythagorean Theorem states that $a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. In this case, we have $a^{2}+b^{2}=10^{2}$, or $a^{2}+b^{2}=100$. Since we know that one angle is $45^{\circ}$, we can use the tangent function to find the ratio of the legs. The tangent of an angle is equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. In this case, the tangent of $45^{\circ}$ is equal to the ratio of the length of the leg to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, we have $a / 10=b / 10$, or $a=b$. Plugging this into our equation, we get $a^{2}+a^{2}=100$, or $2 a^{2}=100$. Solving

4 y^{\prime \prime}+12 y^{\prime}+9 y=0 \Rightarrow y^{\prime \prime}+3 y^{\prime}+2.25 y=0 .
$$
The characteristic equation is $r^2 + 3r + 2.25 = 0$ with roots $r_1 = -1.5$ and $r_2 = -1.5$. The general solution is
$$
y(t)=c_1 e^{-1.5 t}+c_2 t e^{-1.5 t} .
$$
The initial conditions are $y(0) = 1$ and $y^{\prime}(0) = -4$. We have
$$
y(0)=c_1+c_2=1 \Rightarrow c_1+c_2=1
$$
and
$$
y^{\prime}(0)=-1.5 c_1+c_2=-4 \Rightarrow c_2=-5.5 .
$$
Hence $c_1 = 4.5$ and the solution is

 We want to find the maximum interest rate. We know that the monthly payment is \$900, and the term is 20 years. We can use the formula for monthly payment, which is P = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1), where P is the monthly payment, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of payments. We can solve for r by plugging in the values we know, and solving for r. We get r = (P * (1 + r)^n - 1) / (P * (1 + r)^n). We can then plug in the values we know, and solve for r. We get r = (900 * (1 + r)^n - 1) / (900 * (1 + r)^n). We can then plug in the values we know, and solve for r. We get r = (900 * (1 + r)^n - 1) / (900 * (1 + r)^n).

 We know that Marshall has 550 words left to type and class starts in 25 minutes. We want to know how fast he must type to finish his paper on time. We know that 1 minute = 60 seconds. Thus, 25 minutes = 25 * 60 = 1500 seconds. We also know that 1 word = 5 letters. Thus, 550 words = 550 * 5 = 2750 letters. We want to know how many letters Marshall can type in 1500 seconds. Thus, we divide 2750 letters by 1500 seconds to get 1.83 letters per second. We know that 1 letter = 1/5 word. Thus, 1.83 letters = 1.83 * 1/5 = 0.366 words.

 We have 11 pencils = 3 pens. We also have 7 pens = 9.24. We want to find the cost of 1 pencil. We can set up the following equation: 11 pencils = 3 pens = 9.24 / 7 pens. We can then multiply both sides by 7 pens to get 11 pencils * 7 pens = 9.24 pens. We can then divide both sides by 11 pencils to get 7 pens = 9.24 / 11 pencils. We can then multiply both sides by 11 pencils to get 7 pens * 11 pencils = 9.24 pens. We can then divide both sides by 7 pens to get 11 pencils = 9.24 / 7 pens. We can then multiply both sides by 7 pens to get 11 pencils * 7 pens = 9.24 pens. We can then divide both sides by 11 pencils to get 7 pens = 9.24 / 11 pencils. We can then multiply both sides by 11 pencils to get 7 pens * 11 pencils = 9.24 pens. We can then divide both sides by 7 pens to get 11 pencils = 9.

 We know that the water level is a sinusoidal function of time. We know that the water level is 15 feet at 8 A.M. and 3 feet at 2 P.M. We can write the sinusoidal function as $y = A \sin (B t + C)$, where $A$ is the amplitude, $B$ is the frequency, and $C$ is the phase shift. We know that the amplitude is 12 feet, the frequency is 1/6 hours, and the phase shift is 8 A.M. We can write the sinusoidal function as $y = 12 \sin (t / 6 + 8 / 6)$, where $t$ is the time in hours. We want to find the rate of change of the water level at noon, which is 12 hours after 8 A.M. We can find the rate of change of the water level at noon by taking the derivative of the sinusoidal function and evaluating it at 12 hours. The derivative of the sinusoidal function is $12 \cos (t / 6 + 8 / 6)$. Evaluating the derivative at 12 hours, we get $12 \cos (2 / 6 + 8

 We are given the variance of the number of days it takes to build a new house, and the average building time for a sample of 40 new homes. We want to find the confidence with which we can assert that the average building time for a new house is between 80 and 90 days. We can use the Central Limit Theorem to find the confidence. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal with mean equal to the population mean and variance equal to the population variance divided by the sample size. Thus, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal with mean equal to 83 and variance equal to 386/40 = 9.65.

 We know that the mean income is $20,500, and the standard deviation is $3,750. We also know that the distribution of incomes is normally distributed. We can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to find the number of employees with an income between $13,000 and $28,000. The 68-95-99.7 rule states that 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean.

 We want to find the ratio of 2 cups to 3 qt. We know that 1 cup = 1/4 qt, so 2 cups = 2/4 qt = 1/2 qt. Thus 2 cups to 3 qt is 1/2 qt to 3 qt. We can simplify this to 1/6 qt to 3 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 3 qt is 1/6 qt to 6 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 6 qt is 1/6 qt to 1 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1 qt is 1/6 qt to 1/4 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1/4 qt is 1/6 qt to 1/12 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1/12 qt is 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt is 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt is 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt. Thus 1/6 qt to 1/6 qt

 We know that if two ratios form a proportion, then the product of the two ratios is equal to 1. Thus, we can multiply the two ratios together and see if we get 1. If we do, then the two ratios form a proportion. If we do not, then the two ratios do not form a proportion. Let's try each of the options. Option (A) is 60/135 = 4/9. If we multiply these two ratios together, we get 4/9 * 4/9 = 16/81. This is not equal to 1, so the two ratios do not form a proportion. Option (B) is 46/108 = 23/54. If we multiply these two ratios together, we get 23/54 * 23/54 = 529/2916. This is not equal to 1, so the two ratios do not form a proportion. Option (C) is 12/27 = 4/9. If we multiply these two ratios together, we get 4/9 * 4/9 = 16/81. This is not equal to 1, so the two ratios do not form a proportion. Option (D) is

 The product of two nonzero elements is zero if and only if one of the elements is the inverse of the other. In the ring of complex numbers with rational coefficients, the inverse of a nonzero element is not rational, so the product of two nonzero elements is never zero. In the ring of integers modulo 11, the inverse of a nonzero element is not zero, so the product of two nonzero elements is never zero. In the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1], the inverse of a nonzero element is not zero, so the product of two nonzero elements is never zero. In the ring of rational numbers, the inverse of a nonzero element is not zero, so the product of two nonzero elements is never zero.

 We want to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, and a remainder of 5 when divided by 6. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. We have the following system of congruences:
\begin{aligned}
x & \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \\
x & \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \\
x & \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \\
x & \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \\
x & \equiv 5 \pmod{6}
\end{aligned}
We can solve this system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. First, we find the least common multiple of the moduli, which is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6=120$. Then, we find the inverse of each modulus modulo 120. The inverses are:
\begin{aligned}
2^{-1} & \equiv 61 \pmod{120} \\

 We want to find the next time that Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time. We know that Bus A leaves every 75 minutes, and Bus B leaves every 15 minutes. Thus we can set up a system of equations to solve for the time that they will leave the bus station at the same time. Let $x$ be the time that Bus A leaves the bus station, and let $y$ be the time that Bus B leaves the bus station. We know that Bus A leaves every 75 minutes, so $x = 75n$ for some integer $n$. We know that Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, so $y = 15m$ for some integer $m$. We want to find the next time that Bus A and Bus B will leave the bus station at the same time, so we want to find the next time that $x = y$. Thus we have $75n = 15m$, or $5n = 3m$. Since $n$ and $m$ are integers, we can divide both sides by 3 to get $5n / 3 = m$. Thus $m = 5n / 3$. We know that $n$ is an

 We have $3^{x^2+4x+4}=9^{x+2}$. Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get
\[\ln 3^{x^2+4x+4} = \ln 9^{x+2}.\]
Using the logarithm properties, we get
\[(x^2+4x+4)\ln 3 = (x+2)\ln 9.\]
Solving for $x$, we get
\[x^2+4x+4 = \frac{\ln 9}{\ln 3} x + \frac{\ln 9}{\ln 3}.\]
We can solve this quadratic equation to get
\[x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot \frac{\ln 9}{\ln 3}}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot \frac{\ln 9}{\ln 3}}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 4 \cdot \frac{\ln 9}{\ln 3}}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 -

Since $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 1$, we have $f(2) = f(1 + 1) = f(1) + f(1) = 0$. Hence $f(2) = 0$ and $f(3) = f(2 + 1) = f(2) + f(1) = 0 + 1 = 1$. Thus $f(4) = f(3 + 1) = f(3) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 0$. Hence $f(4) = 0$ and $f(5) = f(4 + 1) = f(4) + f(1) = 0 + 1 = 1$. Thus $f(6) = f(

\[(3, 5) \cdot M[0][1] + (4, 6) \cdot M[1][1] = (0, 0)\]
\[(3, 5) \cdot M[0][1] + (4, 6) \cdot M[1][1] = (0, 0)\]
\[(3, 5) \cdot M[0][1] = -(4, 6) \cdot M[1][1]\]
\[(3, 5) \cdot M[0][1] = -(4, 6) \cdot M[1][1]\]
\[(3, 5) \cdot M[0][1] = -(4, 6) \cdot M[1][1]\]

 We are given that the resistances are normally distributed with mean 200 and standard deviation 5. We want to find the probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188. We can use the z-score formula to find the probability. The z-score is given by
\[z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\]
where $x$ is the value of the random variable, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. In our case, $x = 188$, $\mu = 200$, and $\sigma = 5$. Thus
\[z = \frac{188 - 200}{5} = -1.2\]
The probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188 is the same as the probability that a resistor has a resistance less than 188. Thus we can use the z-score formula to find the probability that a resistor has a resistance less than 188. The probability that a resistor has a resistance less than 188 is the same as the probability that a resistor has a resistance less than 188.

We have $f(0) = -10$, $f^{\prime}(0) = 1$, hence $x_1 = -10 / 1 = -10$. We have $f(-10) = 1000 - 200 - 10 = 790$, $f^{\prime}(-10) = -4000 - 600 - 1 = -4601$. We have $x_2 = -790 / -4601 = 0.1718$. We have $f(0.1718) = 0.1718^4 + 2 \cdot 0.1718^3 + 0.1718 - 10 = 0.0001$, $f^{\prime}(0.1718) = 0.0001$. We have $x_3 = 0.0001 / 0.0001

 We have $2^n = n k_1$, $2^n - 1 = (n-1) k_2$, and $2^n - 2 = (n-2) k_3$. Then $2^n - 2 = 2^n - 1 - 1 = (n-1) k_2 - 1 = (n-2) k_3$. Hence $k_2 = k_3 + 1$. Then $2^n - 1 = (n-1) k_2 = (n-1) (k_3 + 1) = (n-2) k_3 + (n-1)$. Hence $2^n - 1 = (n-2) k_3 + (n-1)$. Then $2^n = (n-2) k_3 + (n-1) + 1 = (n-2) k_3 + n$. Hence $n = 2^n - (n-2) k_3$. Then $n = 2^n - (n-2) k_3 = 2^n - (n-2) (2^n - n) = 2^n - 2^n

 We have $y^{\prime}+\frac{2}{3} y=1-\frac{1}{2} t$ and $y(0)=y_0$. We can solve this using the integrating factor method. Let $I(t) = e^{\int \frac{2}{3} dt} = e^{\frac{2}{3} t}$. Then $I(t) y^{\prime} + \frac{2}{3} I(t) y = I(t) (1 - \frac{1}{2} t)$. We can rewrite this as $I(t) y^{\prime} + \frac{2}{3} I(t) y = I(t) - \frac{1}{2} t I(t)$. Then $I(t) y = \int I(t) - \frac{1}{2} t I(t) dt$. We can rewrite this as $I(t) y = \int I(t) dt - \frac{1}{2} \int t I(t) dt$. We can rewrite this as $I(t) y = I(t) t - \frac{1}{2} \int t I(t) dt$.

 We want to find the sample size $n$ such that the maximum error of the estimate of $p$ is equal to 0.03 with 95% confidence. We know that the maximum error of the estimate of $p$ is equal to $1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ with 95% confidence. We want this to be equal to 0.03, so we have
\[1.96 \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.03\]
Solving for $n$ we get

We don't know $p$, but we know that $p \in [0,1]$. Thus the maximum value of $p(1-p)$ is 0.25, and the minimum value of $p(1-p)$ is 0. We have

The probability of getting two balls of the same color is $151 / 300$. The probability of getting two balls of different colors is $149 / 300$. The probability of getting two balls of the same color is the probability of getting two balls of the same color in the first urn times the probability of getting two balls of the same color in the second urn plus the probability of getting two balls of different colors in the first urn times the probability of getting two balls of different colors in the second urn.

 We know that the expected value of the random variable W, the total combined weight of the four players, is 992 pounds. We also know that the standard deviation of W is approximately 47 pounds. We can use the formula for the standard deviation of the sum of random variables to find the standard deviation of W. The formula is:
$$
sigma_{W}=\sqrt{sigma_{X}^{2}+sigma_{Y}^{2}+sigma_{Z}^{2}+sigma_{T}^{2}+2 sigma_{X Y}+2 sigma_{X Z}+2 sigma_{X T}+2 sigma_{Y Z}+2 sigma_{Y T}+2 sigma_{Z T}}

where $X, Y, Z, T$ are the random variables. In our case, $X, Y, Z, T$ are the weights of the four players. We know that the standard deviation of the weight of each player is 47 pounds. Thus, $sigma_{X}^{2}=sigma_{Y}^{2}=sigma_{Z}^{2}=sigma_{T}^{2}=47^{2}=2209$. We also know that the correlation between the weights of the players is

 We know that Pat bounces the ball 25 times in 30 seconds. We want to find the number of times Pat bounces the ball in 150 seconds. We can use the rate formula to find the number of times Pat bounces the ball in 150 seconds. We know that the rate is 25 times in 30 seconds, so we can use the formula rate = time / number of times. We can then solve for the number of times by multiplying the rate by the time. Thus, 25 times / 30 seconds = 150 seconds / number of times. We can then solve for the number of times by multiplying both sides by 150 seconds. Thus, 25 times / 30 seconds = 150 seconds / number of times. We can then solve for the number of times by multiplying both sides by 150 seconds. Thus, 25 times / 30 seconds = 150 seconds / number of times. We can then solve for the number of times by multiplying both sides by 150 seconds. Thus, 25 times / 30 seconds = 150 seconds / number of times. We can then solve for the number of times by multiplying both sides by 150 seconds. Thus, 25 times / 30 seconds =

 The surface area of a rectangular prism is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. The area of each face is the product of the length and width of the face. The length of the front face is 12 inches, the width is 9 inches, so the area is 12 * 9 = 108 square inches. The length of the back face is 12 inches, the width is 2 inches, so the area is 12 * 2 = 24 square inches. The length of the left face is 9 inches, the width is 2 inches, so the area is 9 * 2 = 18 square inches. The length of the right face is 9 inches, the width is 2 inches, so the area is 9 * 2 = 18 square inches. The length of the top face is 12 inches, the width is 9 inches, so the area is 12 * 9 = 108 square inches. The length of the bottom face is 12 inches, the width is 9 inches, so the area is 12 * 9 = 108 square inches. The total surface area is 108 + 24 + 18 + 18 + 108 + 108

 We want to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve at the point where $y = 4$. We know that the tangent line is perpendicular to the normal line, so we can find the normal line and then find the tangent line. The normal line is perpendicular to the curve, so we can find the slope of the normal line by taking the derivative of the curve. The derivative of the curve is $F^{\prime}(t) = (2t, 2^t \ln 2)$. The slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the curve, so the slope of the normal line is $-1 / (2t \ln 2)$. The normal line is $y – 4 = -1 / (2t \ln 2)(x – 2)$. The tangent line is perpendicular to the normal line, so the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the normal line, so the slope of the tangent line is $-1 / (-1 / (2t \ln 2)) = 2t \ln 2$. The tangent line is $y – 4 = 2t \ln 2(x – 2)$. The

 Torricelli's principle states that the outflow velocity $v$ at the outlet is equal to the velocity of a particle falling freely (with no drag) from the height $h$. The volume of the tank is $V=\pi r^{2} h=3 \pi$. The volume of the water in the tank is $V_{w}=\pi r^{2} h_{w}$, where $h_{w}$ is the height of the water surface above the outlet. The volume of the water in the tank is decreasing at a rate of $v \pi r^{2}$. Hence $V_{w}^{\prime}=-v \pi r^{2}$. We have $V_{w}^{\prime}=\pi r^{2} h_{w}^{\prime}$. Hence $h_{w}^{\prime}=-v$. The velocity of a particle falling freely (with no drag) from the height $h$ is $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$. Hence $h_{w}^{\prime}=-\sqrt{2 g h_{w}}$.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on world religions for help. The Qur'an is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God. It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The word Qur'an first appears in the last section (sura) of the Qur'an, at 75:18. It is a verbal noun (maṣdar) of the Arabic verb qaraʾa (قرأ), meaning "he read" or "he recited". The Syriac equivalent is "qeryānā" (ܩܪܝܢܐ), which refers to "scripture reading" or "lesson". While some Western scholars consider the word to be derived from the Syriac, the majority of Muslim authorities hold the opinion that it is not derived from Syriac. The word often connotes the meaning of "recitation". The term also has strongly resonant meanings in Arabic related to God's active creation of the world. God is the ultimate creator, the source of everything. God is also its sustainer and guardian, one who listens and responds to prayer. The Qur'an describes itself as a "preserved book" (50:4) and "the revelation

We can then assign the truth value true to the third proposition, (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W. We can then check to see if the set is consistent by checking to see if all of the propositions are true.

 The de Broglie wavelength of a particle is given by $\lambda = h/p$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is the momentum of the particle. The momentum of a particle is given by $p = mv$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is the velocity of the particle. So the de Broglie wavelength of an electron is given by $\lambda = h/mv$. The lattice spacing of the crystal is 0.4 nm, so the de Broglie wavelength of the electron must be 0.4 nm in order to see the pattern. So we can solve for the velocity of the electron: $v = h/m\lambda$. The mass of an electron is $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$ kg, so the velocity of the electron is $v = (6.63 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s})/(9.1 \times 10^{-31} \text{ kg})(0.4 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}) = 3.7 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}$.

 The moment of inertia of the man is 4 slug-ft^2, and the moment of inertia of the weights is 10 lb-ft^2. The moment of inertia of the man plus the weights is 4 + 10 = 14 slug-ft^2. The angular momentum of the man plus the weights is 4 pi rad/sec times 14 slug-ft^2, or 56 slug-ft^2/sec. The angular momentum of the man is 4 pi rad/sec times 4 slug-ft^2, or 16 slug-ft^2/sec. The angular momentum of the weights is 56 - 16 = 40 slug-ft^2/sec. The angular momentum of the weights is 40 slug-ft^2/sec times 1/2 sec, or 20 slug-ft^2. The moment of inertia of the weights is 20 slug-ft^2 divided by 3 ft, or 6.67 slug-ft. The angular velocity of the weights is 6.67 slug-ft divided by 10 lb-ft^2, or 0.667 rad/sec.

 The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is temperature. We can rearrange this to get $V = nRT/P$. The number of moles is constant, so we can divide both sides by $P$ to get $V/P = nRT/P^2$. We can then divide both sides by $R$ to get $V/P = nT/P^2$. We can then divide both sides by $T$ to get $V/P = n/P^2$. We can then divide both sides by $n$ to get $V/P = 1/P^2$. We can then divide both sides by $P$ to get $V/P^2 = 1/P$. We can then divide both sides by $P$ to get $V/P^3 = 1$. We can then divide both sides by $V$ to get $1/P^3 = 1/V$. We can then divide both sides by $1/V$ to get $1/P^3 = 1/V$.

 The moment of inertia of a solid sphere is $I = 2/5 MR^2$, where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. So in our case, $I = 2/5 (0.06 kg)(0.15 m)^2 = 0.00054 kg·m^2$. The angular momentum of the sphere is $L = I\omega = (0.00054 kg·m^2)(20 rad/s) = 0.0108 kg·m^2/s$. The friction force is $F = \mu N = \mu mg = \mu (4/3)\pi R^3 \rho$, where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction, $N$ is the normal force, $m$ is the mass of the sphere, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\rho$ is the density of the sphere. So in our case, $F = (0.3 m)(2.0 N/m)(4/3)\pi (0.15 m)^3 (8.0 g/cm^3) = 0.18 N$. The friction force is equal to the rate of change of angular momentum, so $F = dL/d

 The potential energy of a particle in an elliptical orbit is given by $U = -\frac{k}{r}$, where $r$ is the distance from the center of the orbit. The time average of this potential energy is given by $\langle U \rangle = \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T U(t) dt$, where $T$ is the period of the orbit. Substituting the expression for $U$ and integrating, we get $\langle U \rangle = -\frac{k}{a} \int_0^T \frac{1}{r(t)} dt$. Now, the period of the orbit is given by $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{k}}$, so we can substitute this into the integral to get $\langle U \rangle = -\frac{k}{a} \int_0^{2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{k}}} \frac{1}{r(t)} dt$.

 The uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in position and the uncertainty in momentum is greater than or equal to Planck's constant divided by 2π. In this case, the uncertainty in position is the radius of the nucleus, and the uncertainty in momentum is the momentum of the neutron. The momentum of the neutron is its mass times its velocity, and the velocity is the uncertainty in position divided by the uncertainty in time.

 The visibility of the fringes is zero when the angle subtended by the star is equal to the angle subtended by the separation of the mirrors. The angle subtended by the star is the angle subtended by the diameter of the star, which is twice the angle subtended by the star. The angle subtended by the star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the distance to the star, so the angle subtended by the star is 2 times the ratio of the diameter of the star to the distance to the star. The angle subtended by the separation of the mirrors is the ratio of the separation of the mirrors to the distance to the star. So the visibility of the fringes is zero when the ratio of the diameter of the star to the distance to the star is equal to the ratio of the separation of the mirrors to the distance to the star.

 The electron is repelled by the plate, so the electric force on the electron is in the opposite direction of the velocity of the electron. The force is given by Coulomb's law, $F = k q_1 q_2 / r^2$, where $q_1$ is the charge of the electron, $q_2$ is the charge of the plate, and $r$ is the distance from the electron to the plate. The force is equal to the mass of the electron times the acceleration, $F = m a$, where $a$ is the acceleration of the electron. The acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time, $a = \Delta v / \Delta t$. The change in velocity is the final velocity minus the initial velocity, $\Delta v = v_f - v_i$. The time is the distance divided by the velocity, $\Delta t = d / v$. Putting all this together, we get $F = m a = m \Delta v / \Delta t = m (v_f - v_i) / (d / v) = m v_f v / d - m v_i v / d = m v_f v / d - m v v / d = m v_f v /

The internal energy is then N times the sum of the energies of all the particles, which is N times the sum of the probabilities of each particle being in each energy level times the energy of each level, or N times the sum of P_+ \epsilon + P_- (-\epsilon), or N times the sum of \epsilon/(1 + e^{-2\epsilon/KT}) - \epsilon e^{-2\epsilon/KT}/(1 + e^{-2\epsilon/KT}), or N times the sum of \epsilon/(1 + e^{-2\epsilon

 The stress in each rod is the same, since the rods are pinned together. The stress is the force per unit area, so we need to find the force. The force is the product of the Young's modulus and the change in length, so we need to find the change in length. The change in length is the product of the coefficient of expansion and the change in temperature, so we need to find the change in temperature. The change in temperature is 40°C - 20°C = 20°C. The coefficient of expansion for brass is 1.8 × 10 ^-5 C deg ^-1, so the change in length for the brass rod is 1.8 × 10 ^-5 C deg ^-1 × 20°C = 0.36 × 10 ^-3 m. The coefficient of expansion for steel is 1.2 × 10 ^-5 C deg ^-1, so the change in length for the steel rod is 1.2 × 10 ^-5 C deg ^-1 × 20°C = 0.24 × 10 ^-3 m.

 The radius of a planet is given by the equation $R = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}}$, where $M$ is the mass of the planet and $\rho$ is the density of the planet. The mass of the planet is given by the equation $M = \frac{4\pi R^3}{3}\rho$, where $R$ is the radius of the planet and $\rho$ is the density of the planet. We can solve for $R$ in terms of $M$ and $\rho$ by substituting the second equation into the first equation, giving $R = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho

 The first thing to do is to figure out the length of a lavender caterpillar. We know that a line of 3 lavender caterpillars and 1 mauve caterpillar is as long as a line of 8 violet caterpillars, so the length of a lavender caterpillar is 1/3 the length of a violet caterpillar. We also know that a violet caterpillar is twice as long as a lavender caterpillar, so the length of a lavender caterpillar is 1/6 the length of a violet caterpillar. Combining these two facts, we find that the length of a lavender caterpillar is 1/18 the length of a violet caterpillar. We also know that a lavender caterpillar takes 10 s to crawl the length of a violet caterpillar, so the speed of a lavender caterpillar is 1/180 the speed of a violet caterpillar. We also know that a violet caterpillar is twice as fast as a mauve caterpillar, so the speed of a mauve caterpillar is 1/360 the speed of a violet caterpillar. We also know that a mauve caterpillar is twice as fast as a lavender caterpillar, so the speed of a mauve caterpillar is 1/90

 The electric flux through a spherical surface is given by the product of the electric field and the area of the surface. The electric field is given by the Coulomb's law, $E = kQ/r^2$, where $k$ is a constant, $Q$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance from the charge. The area of the surface is given by the surface area of a sphere, $4\pi r^2$. So the electric flux is given by $4\pi kQ/r$. We can solve for $Q$ to get $Q = \frac{r}{4\pi k} \times \frac{E}{A}$. In our case, $r = 1$ m, $k = 9\times 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C$, $E = 4.0\times 10^4 N \cdot m^2/C$, and $A = 4\pi$.

 The time it takes for the sound to reach the ground is the time it takes for the water to hit the ground, plus the time it takes for the sound to travel from the ground to the student. The time it takes for the water to hit the ground is the time it takes for the water to fall from the top of the building to the ground, which is the time it takes for the water to fall a distance equal to the height of the building. The time it takes for the sound to travel from the ground to the student is the time it takes for the sound to travel a distance equal to the height of the building. So the total time is twice the time it takes for the sound to travel a distance equal to the height of the building. The time it takes for the sound to travel a distance $h$ is $h / 331 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, so the total time is $2 h / 331 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

 (a) The number of photons emitted per second is the power divided by the energy of a single photon, which is given by Planck's constant times the frequency. The frequency is the speed of light divided by the wavelength, so the number of photons emitted per second is 1 milliwatt divided by 6.63 × 10^-34 J s × 3 × 10^8 m/s / 6.328 × 10^-7 m, or 3.2 × 10^15 photons per second. (b) The number of photons emitted per second by a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is the area times the Stefan-Boltzmann constant times the fourth power of the temperature. The area is the same as the laser, so we need to find the temperature that gives the same number of photons per second. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 5.67 × 10^-8 W m^-2 K^-4, so the temperature is the square root of the number of photons per second divided by the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, or the square root of 3.2 × 10^15 photons per second / 5.67 × 10^-8

 The escape velocity is the speed at which the gravitational force is exactly balanced by the kinetic energy of the object. The gravitational force is given by $F = G M m / r^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the earth, $m$ is the mass of the object, and $r$ is the distance from the center of the earth. The kinetic energy is given by $E = 1/2 m v^2$, where $v$ is the velocity of the object. Setting these two equal to each other and solving for $v$ gives the escape velocity: $v = \sqrt{2 G M / r}$.

 The acceleration of the train is constant, so we can use the kinematic equation $v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a\Delta x$ to find the distance traveled in the first 5 minutes.

 The partition function is the integral of the Boltzmann factor over all possible states, and the Boltzmann factor is the exponential of the energy divided by the temperature. The energy of a particle in a two-dimensional box is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is the speed of the particle. The speed is related to the temperature by the equipartition theorem, which says that the average kinetic energy of a particle is $\frac{1}{2}kT$, where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant. So the energy is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}kT$, and the Boltzmann factor is $e^{-\frac{1}{2}mv^2/kT} = e^{-\frac{1}{2}mv^2/kT}$. The partition function is then the integral of this factor over all possible speeds, which is the integral of $e^{-\frac{1}{2}mv^2/kT}$ from 0 to infinity. This integral is equal to $\sqrt{\frac{kT}{2\pi m}}$, which is the value of the partition function

 The resolution of a lens is given by the Rayleigh criterion, which says that two point sources are resolved if the angular separation between them is greater than the angular resolution of the lens. The angular resolution of a lens is given by the diffraction limit, which is the angle subtended by the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the lens. The angular resolution is given by $\lambda/D$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light and $D$ is the diameter of the lens. In our case, the wavelength of the light is 550 nm, and the diameter of the lens is 25 mm. The angular resolution is then 550 nm / 25 mm, or 22 microradians. The angular separation between two point sources is given by the ratio of their separation to the distance to the lens. In our case, the separation between the two point sources is 50 mm, and the distance to the lens is 50 mm. The angular separation is then 50 mm / 50 mm, or 1 radian. The two point sources are resolved if the angular separation is greater than the angular resolution, so the two point sources are resolved if 1 radian is greater than 22 microradians. This is true,

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in Psychological Review. Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, all of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. Maslow used the terms "physiological", "safety", "belongingness" and "love", "esteem", "self-actualization", and "self-transcendence" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through. The theory is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid. The lowest level of the pyramid is the most important, and represents the most basic needs. The next level is slightly higher, and represents the next most important needs, and so on. The highest level is the least important, and represents the most advanced needs.
