 Ontogeny refers to the individual development of a single organism over time, from the fertilized egg or zygote to the mature organism. It is the process of growth and differentiation, which includes all the changes that an organism undergoes as it develops. In humans, this process begins with the formation of a zygote and ends with a mature fetus ready for birth. The significance of this process is that it mirrors the evolutionary history of the species, a concept known as "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny." This means that the embryos of all vertebrates, including humans, share similar features early in their development, reflecting their shared ancestry. This is (F).

 The incidence of CF among Caucasians is 1 in 2000 births, which means that 1 out of every 2000 Caucasian babies is born with CF. Among nonwhites, the incidence is much lower, or 1 in 250,000. If we consider a cross between a Caucasian and a nonwhite, the probability of the Caucasian parent contributing the CF allele is 1/2000, and the probability of the nonwhite parent contributing the CF allele is 1/250,000. The probability of their offspring having CF is the product of these two probabilities, or 1/2000 * 1/250,000 = 1/4,000,000. This means that the incidence of CF among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites is 1 in 4,000,000 births, or 0.025% (1/4000). If these offspring were to mate randomly among themselves, the incidence among their offspring would be 1 in 100,000 births, or 0.1% (1/10

 We have 798 students, and 60.4% of them are tasters, which means that they have at least one dominant allele T. We can calculate the frequency of T as follows: $p = \frac{number\,of\,TT\,+\,number\,of\,Tt}{total\,number\,of\,students} = \frac{x+2x}{798} = 0.604$. This gives us $p = 0.371$ and $q = 0.629$. To find the number of students with each genotype, we can use the following equations: $TT = p^2$, $Tt = 2pq$ and $tt = q^2$. This gives us $TT = 0.371^2 = 0.138$, $Tt = 2 \cdot 0.371 \cdot 0.629 = 0.462$ and $tt = 0.629^2 = 0.39$. So the number of students with TT is 0.138 * 798 =

 Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of the A and B antigens on the surface of red blood cells and the presence or absence of the Rh antigen. Blood types are inherited in a Mendelian fashion. The IA and IB genes, which code for the A and B antigens, are codominant, meaning that if an individual is heterozygous for either gene, both antigens will be expressed. The i gene, which codes for the absence of both A and B antigens (type O), is recessive to both IA and IB. The Rh gene is also Mendelian, with the dominant allele, R, coding for the Rh antigen, and the r gene being recessive. If an individual is homozygous for the r allele, they are Rh-. Blood type can be determined by a Punnett square. For the IA and IB genes, we get AA, Ai, iA, and ii from the type B parent and AA, Ae, Ae, and ee from the type AB parent. For the Rh gene, we get RR and Rr from both parents. Combining the two, we get four possible genotypes: AARR, AArR, AArr, and aarr. Of these four, only AArR and AArr

 The liver has many functions, including the production of bile, which aids digestion, and the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. It also detoxifies ammonia, produces cholesterol, and plays a role in blood clotting and the activation of vitamin D. In addition, the liver stores vitamins and minerals and regulates glucose levels by converting excess glucose into glycogen. It also synthesizes several plasma proteins, including those involved in the clotting cascade. The liver does not produce insulin or glucagon, which are produced by the pancreas, and it does not produce digestive enzymes or absorb nutrients, which are functions of the small intestine. The liver also does not break down muscle tissue or recycle red blood cells, which are functions of macrophages. Therefore, the correct answer is the combination of (C), (D), (E), and (F).

 Transgressive segregation occurs when the F_2 generation shows traits that are more extreme than either parental type, which is (F). This phenomenon is explained by the fact that some genes are not independently assorting during meiosis, and thus the traits linked to these genes are not segregating in the Mendelian ratio. Instead, these genes are inherited together, and the resulting phenotype in the offspring can be more extreme than the parental phenotypes.

 Stimuli are the active elements in the environment that elicit a response from an organism. They are not passive elements, which makes (G) and (J) incorrect. Stimuli are not always visual; they can also be auditory, olfactory, or tactile, which rules out (G). The intensity of a stimulus does not determine whether or not it will elicit a response, which makes (A) incorrect. Stimuli do not need to be novel to be effective, which rules out (F). Stimuli are not species-specific, and (D) is incorrect. Animals interpret stimuli differently based on their motivations, previous experiences, and internal states, which makes (I) incorrect. The intensity of a stimulus is not directly related to the animal's motivation, so (B) is also incorrect. Stimuli, especially those referred to as sign stimuli, can elicit specific responses, which makes (E) correct. The animal's past experiences and learned associations with a stimulus influence how it will respond, which makes (H) correct. Therefore, the correct answers are (E) and (H).

 Differential reproduction is the process by which individuals with certain heritable traits have more offspring than others. The traits that contribute to differential reproduction are often referred to as Darwinian fitness traits. The answer (I) is correct because differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.

 The parathyroid glands are small, pea-sized glands located behind the thyroid gland. They secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases blood calcium levels by acting on bone, kidney, and intestine. PTH stimulates osteoclast activity, which increases bone resorption and the release of calcium into the bloodstream. It also stimulates the reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and increases calcium absorption in the intestines. Therefore, the parathyroid glands regulate the calcium-phosphate balance between the blood and other tissues, which is (E).

 Glomerular filtration is the process by which plasma is filtered from the blood to produce urine. It occurs in the glomerulus of the nephron. The glomerulus is a network of small blood vessels called capillaries. Blood enters the glomerulus through an arteriole called the afferent arteriole and leaves through an efferent arteriole. The wall of each glomerular capillary is composed of three layers: the endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane, and the podocytes. The endothelial cells and the basement membrane together form the glomerular filtration barrier, which is selectively permeable, allowing water and solutes of low molecular weight to pass into the space surrounding the capillaries, called Bowman's space or the capsule. This space collects the filtrate, which then becomes urine. The driving force for filtration is the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, which is about half the mean arterial pressure, or option (D). The pressure in the Bowman's capsule is lower than that in the capillaries. The capillary walls do not have large pores, ruling out (E). The glomerular filtration barrier does not allow blood cells to pass, which rules out (F). The osmotic pressure of the blood is higher than that in the Bowman's space, but

 The lac operon is controlled by the repressor protein, which binds to the operator region and prevents transcription of the structural genes. The repressor protein is produced from the lacI gene, which is located outside the operon. The inducer molecule allolactose binds to the repressor and changes its shape so that it can no longer bind to the operator. The repressor protein is also regulated by the presence of the lac gene products. The lac genes are organized in the following order: i^-, o^-, z^-, y^-, and a^-. The repressor protein binds to the operator region (o^-). The product of the structural gene z^-, beta-galactosidase, provides feedback regulation by binding to and stabilizing the repressor protein. The y^- gene product, permease, transports lactose into the cell. The a^- gene product, transacetylase, converts lactose into allolactose, the inducer molecule.

In (a) i^+o^+z^-y^-a^-, the repressor protein will be produced, and bind to the operator region, repressing transcription. The presence of the inducer molecule will not change this, so there will be no production

 The resistance to DDT in mosquitoes arose due to a mutation in the gene coding for a protein that binds DDT, which results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein and thus reduces its affinity for DDT. This is a classic example of natural selection, where individuals with a certain heritable trait are more likely to survive and reproduce. The trait in this case is resistance to DDT, so the individuals with the mutation that confers resistance are more likely to survive the pesticide and reproduce, passing the mutation on to their offspring. Over time, this leads to an increase in the frequency of the resistance allele in the population, so (I) is the correct answer.

 Identical twins share 100% of their genes, while non-identical twins share about 50% of their genes, just like ordinary siblings. If a trait is more common among identical twins than non-identical twins, then scientists know that genetics plays a role in determining that trait. If the trait is influenced more by the environment, then the trait would be more likely to be shared by non-identical twins. Twins studies can isolate the effect of prenatal factors on traits by comparing twins raised apart, which makes (I) the correct answer.

 We have a dominant trait, so the genotypes RR and Rr both result in the phenotype of being a tongue roller. The frequency of tongue rollers is 36%. We can write two equations:
$\boxed{f(RR) + f(Rr)}$ = 0.36
$f(RR)$ = 0.36 - $f(Rr)$
We also know that the sum of all genotypes equals 1:
$f(RR) + f(Rr) + f(rr)$ = 1
Substituting the first equation into the second one, we get:
0.36 + $f(Rr)$ + $f(rr)$ = 1
$f(Rr)$ + $f(rr)$ = 0.64
Now we can solve for $f(Rr)$ and $f(rr)$:
$f(Rr)$ = 0.32, $f(rr)$ = 0.32
The frequency of the R allele is $(0.32 + 0.36)/2 = 0.34$ and the frequency of the r allele is $(0.32 + 0.64

Variation arises from mutations and recombination events, and it is present in a population before natural selection acts upon it. Variation is not created by natural selection directly, so (A) is incorrect. Variation is not always increased when diploid organisms produce gametes, as the process of meiosis and recombination can either increase or decrease it, so (D) is also incorrect. Variation is affected by the environment, as mutations are often induced by environmental factors, and so (E) is incorrect. Variation can also be created by artificial selection, so (F) is incorrect.

 The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the initial velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction in terms of substrate concentration. The equation is $V_0 = \frac{V_{max} \cdot S}{K_m + S}$. As the substrate concentration increases, the reaction rate increases until it reaches the maximum velocity, $V_{max}$. At this point, the enzyme is saturated with substrate and further increases in substrate concentration have no effect on the reaction rate. This means that all of the enzyme molecules are interacting with substrate molecules, which makes (G) the correct answer.

 The statement claims that the ovule of a rose is analogous to the capsule of a moss. In other words, it suggests that these two structures are homologous, i.e. they evolved from a common ancestor. However, this is not the case: the ovule is a structure specific to angiosperms, or flowering plants, while mosses are non-vascular plants and do not produce ovules. Instead, the capsule of a moss is the structure in which spores are produced. These spores are haploid and give rise to gametophytes, which produce gametes. In contrast, the ovule of angiosperms contains the megasporangium, which produces the female gametophyte.

 Self-fertilization results in offspring that are homozygous for every gene pair, because each gamete produced by the parent will be either AA or aa, BB or bb, etc. This means that the probability of the offspring being identical to the parent is 0, so (A) is incorrect. The probability of the offspring being homozygous is 1/2 for each gene pair, so the probability of being homozygous for all five gene pairs is 1/2^5 = 1/32, which makes (E) the correct answer for part (b). For part (c), we need to calculate the probability of the offspring being heterozygous for all five gene pairs. This probability is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/32, and the probability of being homozygous dominant for all five gene pairs is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1 = 1/32, which means that the proportion of progeny phenotypically exhibiting the dominant form for all five characters is 2 *

The F_1 generation will therefore consist of 100% CcBb individuals. The F_2 generation is formed by crossing two F_1 individuals, so we have CcBb × CcBb. We can now fill out the Punnett square: P: CCBB × ccbb F_1 × F_1 CcBb × CcBb CB: CCBB CcBb Ccbb cb: CcBb Ccbb The resulting genotypes are CCBB, CCBb, CcBB, and Ccbb, with genotypic frequencies of CCBB:CcBb::CcBb:Ccbb::1:3. The resulting phenotypes are checkered red (CCBB and CcBb), checkered brown (CcBB and Ccbb), plain red (CCBb), and plain brown (Ccbb).

 Each A allele adds 5 cm to the height, and each B allele also adds 5 cm to the height. So AABB has two A and two B alleles, and thus has a height of 2 * 5 cm = 10 cm. Similarly, aabb has zero A and zero B alleles, and thus has a height of 0 * 5 cm = 0 cm. AaBb has one A and one B allele, and thus has a height of 1 * 5 cm = 5 cm. This means that (a) is correct with the answer AABB = 25 cm and aabb = 5 cm. For (b), the F1 generation will all be heterozygous, and thus have a height of 5 cm + 5 cm = 10 cm. So the answer to (b) is AaBb = 10 cm. For (c), we know that the F2 generation will have a ratio of genotypes that is the same as the ratio of alleles, since the alleles segregate independently.

Kirk's initial capital was$72,000, and Martin's was $63,000. Kirk withdrew$3,000 and invested $1,200 more, so his remaining capital is$70,800 (72000 - 3000 + 1200). Martin's remaining capital is $61,200 (63000 - 1800). The total interest to be paid is 6% of the average investment, which is$67,800 ((72000 + 63000)/2). The interest amounts to $4068 (67800 * 6%$). After the interest is paid, Kirk's share of the remaining capital is 70800/134400 * 100% = 53% of the total, and Martin's share is 61200/134400 * 100

 We first calculate the balance after 3 years at 4% interest compounded quarterly. The formula for compound interest is FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where FV is the future value, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate in decimal form, n is the number of times compounded per year, and t is the number of years. So we have FV = 2000(1 + 0.04/4)^(4*3) = 2000(1.01)^12 = 2487.61. 

Next, we calculate the balance after 5 years at 5% interest compounded semi-annually. The formula for compound interest with semi-annual compounding is FV = P(1 + r/2)^(n*t), where the definitions of the variables are the same as above.

 We first find the total fixed costs per unit of the better quality carpet, which is$122,200 / ($6 - $3) = 11,000 yards. Then we find the contribution margin of each type of carpet, which is$4 and $2 per yard. To earn a profit of$50,000, the total contribution margin needs to be $50,000 /$4 = 12,500 yards from the better quality carpet. And the total contribution margin from the other type of carpet is 12,500 yards as both carpets have the same dollar sales. So the total yards needed to be sold from the better quality carpet is 11,000 + 12,500 = 23,500 yards. And the total yards needed to be sold from the other type of carpet is 23,500 yards as well. Therefore, the final answer is 23,500 yards and 23,500 yards, which is (B).

 We refer to the formula for stockturn rate:
StockturnRate = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory Value
Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of the inventory sold during the year which is 300,000.
Average inventory value is (90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000.
So StockturnRate (at Cost) = 300,000 / 80,000 = 3.75.

Selling price of the current inventory is 120,000 and the previous inventory is 80,000; the average is (120,000 + 80,000) / 2 = 100,000.
So StockturnRate (at selling price) = 380,000 / 100,000 = 3.8.

Number of units turned over is calculated by dividing the number of units sold by the StockturnRate (in units) = 360,000 / 3.75

 We first calculate the balance after 10 years without any further deposits or withdrawals. Future value (FV) can be calculated using the formula: FV = P(1 + r)^n, where P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate and n is the number of compounding periods. So, FV = 1000*(1 + 0.04)^10 = 1464.10. The answer for part (a) is $1,464.10.
For part (b), we calculate the new balance after each deposit of$30 at the beginning of each year. The new principal amount will be $1,030 at the beginning of the first year, $1,060.32 at the beginning of the second year, and so on. Using the same formula, we get FV = 1030*(1 + 0.04)^10 = 1845.38.

The probability of success is $\gamma$, and the probability of failure is $1-\gamma$. So the probability that the wheel lands on a failure after one step is $(1-\gamma)$. The probability that it lands on a success is $\gamma$.

After two steps, the probability of success is $(\gamma)(\gamma) = \gamma^2$, and the probability of failure is $(1-\gamma)(1-\gamma)$. So the probability that the wheel lands on two consecutive failures is $(1-\gamma)^2$.

Continuing in this manner, we see that the probability that the wheel fails after an even number of steps is $(1-\gamma)^{n}$, and the probability that it fails after an odd number of steps is $\gamma(1-\gamma)^{n-1}$. So the probability that it fails after $n$ steps is $$\left(\gamma(1-\gamma)^{n-1}\right)\left((1-\gamma)^2\right)^{n/2} = \gamma(1-\gamma)^{n}.$$Therefore, the probability that it succeeds after $n$ steps is $1-\gamma(1-\gamma)^{n}$.

 We refer to the question to find the relationship between the price and the number of units sold: for every 1-cent increase, the sales drop by 10 units. This means that for a 10-cent increase, the sales will drop by 10 * 10 = 100 units.
The total revenue can be calculated as Price * Number of units sold.
At $2.00 per unit, the total revenue is 2 * 2000 =$4000.
If the price increases by 10 cents to $2.10, the number of units sold will drop by 100 to 2000 - 100 = 1900. The total revenue will be 2.1 * 1900 = $3990.

 We know that the machine costs$1,000 and it will save us $150 each year for the next 10 years. So the total saving will be 150 * 10 =$1,500. The rate of return is calculated as follows:
Rate of return = (Future value / Cost of investment) - 1
Rate of return = (1500 / 1000) - 1
Rate of return = 1.5 - 1
Rate of return = 0.5
The answer is 5% or (H).

 Breakeven point is the point where the total cost is equal to the total revenue. We have fixed costs of $300, and variable costs of 75\textcent per book. So, total cost is $3.75 per book. To find the number of books required to reach the breakeven point, we set $3.75 equal to revenue, or 1.00 $\times$ number of books sold. So, 1 book $\times$ $\$3.75 =$ $\$1.00 \times$ unknown. The unknown must be 3.75, or 375 books. Adding this to our fixed cost of 300, the final answer is $\boxed{675\text{ books}}$.<EOS_TOKEN>Final answer: 675<EOS_TOKEN>

In this case, the monthly interest rate r = 12x/100, where x is the annual interest rate, which is usually unknown. We can assume a common annual interest rate 10%. Thus r = 12x10/100 = 12%. The number of compounding periods n = 12. Then we have Carrying charge = 525(1 + 12/100)12 - 525 = 525 * 2.71 - 525 = 1423.5 - 525 = $\boxed{898.5}$.

 The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the radioactive nuclei to decay. This means that after one half-life, we will have 
rac{1}{2} of the original amount of nuclei left, after two half-lives 
rac{1}{4}, and so on. We can therefore compute the amount of time it takes to reach any quantity by successive division by 2. In this case, we want to know how much time it takes to reach 
rac{1}{8} of the original amount, or 3 half-lives. 3 $\cdot$ 6 hours = 18 hours. 18 hours is greater than the 24 hours given, which means some of the nuclei will still be left after this time. We now compute the amount left at 24 hours by finding the amount left after 18 hours, and dividing that number by 2. Starting with 150 mCi, we have $N(t) = 150 \cdot

First we compute the heat capacity at both temperatures: at 50°C, $C_{p,50} = a + b \cdot 50 = 5.41 + 72 = 77.41$ cal mol^-1 K^-1; at 200°C, $C_{p,200} = a + b \cdot 200 = 5.41 + 300 = 305.41$ cal mol^-1 K^-1. The heat required is then given by the equation $\Delta H = m \cdot C_p \cdot \Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the sample in grams, which we take to be 1 mole, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature, in this case 150°C. Putting it all together, we get $\Delta H = 2 \cdot 77

 First, we calculate the volume of the cube, which is 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 mL = 1 cm^3. The density of carbon tetrachloride is given as 1.46 g/cm^3, so the mass of the sample is equal to the volume times the density, or 1.46 g. We will also need the Avogadro constant, which is 6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1. First, we find the number of chlorine atoms in the sample. $n = \frac{1.46 \, \text{g}}{123.89 \, \text{g/mol}} \cdot \frac{1 \, \text{mol}}{6.022 \cdot 10^{23} \, \text{Cl atoms}} = 1.18 \cdot 10^{22} \, \text{Cl atoms}$.

 First, we need to find the mass of the nucleus. The mass of one fluorine atom is the sum of the masses of 9 protons and 9 electrons, which is equal to $(9 \cdot 1.00728) + (9 \cdot 0.000549) = 18.015 u$. The mass of the nucleus is simply the mass number, which is 19 u. The mass fraction of the nucleus is then given by $\frac{19}{18.015} \approx 0.994553$. To find the volume fraction occupied by the nucleus, we first find the radius of the nucleus, which is given by the equation $r^1 = (1.5 \cdot 10^{-15} \, \text{m}) \, (19^{1/3}) = 2.4 \cdot 10^{-13} \, \text{m}$.

 The rotational partition function is given by:
$Q_{rot} = \frac{8\pi^2 kT}{h^2} \int_{0}^{\infty} B_{\mathrm{rot}} \cdot \mathrm{d}I$
where $B_{\mathrm{rot}}$ is the rotational constant and $I$ is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia depends on the mass of the molecule and the internuclear distance, which is the same for both molecules. The only difference between the two molecules is the mass of one nitrogen atom, which is increased by 1 amu due to the presence of a ^15N nucleus. This means that the reduced mass, which appears in the denominator of $I$, is larger for ^14N^15N than for ^14N_2, which means that the integral will be larger for ^14N^15N than for ^14N_2. The rotational constant depends on the internuclear distance, which is the same for both molecules, and so will be the same for both. Therefore the partition function will be larger for ^14N^15N than for ^14N_

 First, we need to convert the mass of polonium to moles. 4 × 10^(-12) g × 210 g/mol = 8.4 × 10^(-10) mol. The number of nuclei in this sample is then given by Avogadro's number times this quantity, or 8.4 × 10^26 nuclei. The half-life of polonium-210 is given as 138 days × 60 × 24 hr/day × 365.25 days/year = 3.09 × 10^7 s. Using the equation N(t) = N_0 × 2^(t/t_1/2), we find that after one half-life the number of nuclei is reduced to half, or 4.2 × 10^26 nuclei. This means that in one half-life, 4.2 × 10^26 / 2 = 2.1 × 10^26 nuclei are decayed. Since this occurs in 3.09 × 10^7 s, the decay constant is given by

 We substitute the wave function into the Schrodinger equation, $H\psi = E\psi$. We first compute the kinetic energy operator acting on the wave function. $T = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu} \frac{d^2}{dx^2} e^{-B x^2} = \frac{\hbar^2 B}{2\mu} e^{-B x^2}$. The potential energy is given in the question as $U = \frac{1}{2} K x^2$. The Schrodinger equation then becomes $\frac{\hbar^2 B}{2\mu} e^{-B x^2} + \frac{1}{2} K x^2 e^{-B x^2} = E e^{-B x^2}$. We multiply both sides by $e^{Bx^2}$ to obtain $\frac{\hbar^2 B}{2\mu} + \frac{1}{2} K x^2 = E$.

 First we write the equilibrium expression and solve for the equilibrium constant. $K_c =$
rac{[NH_3][H_2S]}{[NH_4HS]}$. At the start, we have 0.06 moles of NH_4HS and 0 moles of the other species, so the initial reaction quotient is Q = 0. At equilibrium, the amount of NH_4HS will be reduced to 0.06 - x, while the amount of NH_3 and H_2S will increase by x. The equilibrium constant can then be written as $K_c =$
rac{x^2}{0.06 - x}$. We can solve this quadratic equation to obtain the values of x at equilibrium. These are approximately 0.026 and 0.034. The smaller value corresponds to the amount of NH_4HS remaining at equilibrium, so 36.1% of the solid will have decomposed, or (A). To reduce the decomposition to 1% we need to add enough NH_3 so that the new equilibrium position is shifted leftwards to where only 1% of the solid has decomposed. This corresponds to 0

 We are given the total pressure and the masses of each of the gases. We can use Dalton's law of partial pressures to solve for the pressure of each individual gas. The law states that the total pressure is the sum of the pressures of each gas, or $P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{N}_{2}} + P_{\text{Ar}} + P_{\text{H}_{2}\text{O}}$. We also know that the pressure of each gas is proportional to its molarity, or $P = x \cdot P_{\text{total}}$, where $x$ is the mole fraction of the gas. The molar mass of nitrogen is 28.0 g/mol, of argon is 40.0 g/mol, and of water vapor is 18.0 g/mol. Therefore the mole fractions are $x_{\text{N}_{2}} = 28.0/(28.0 + 40.0 + 18.0) = 0.4$, $x_{\text{Ar}} = 40.0/(28.0 + 40.0 + 18.0) =

 We need to integrate the absolute square of the wavefunction between 2.000 and 2.001 Å. We first square the wavefunction and separate the time-dependent and time-independent parts. We obtain $\Psi^2 = 4(\sin^2 at + \cos^2 at)(4x^2 / c^4) e^{-2x^2 / c^2}$. The time-independent part can be evaluated by integration between the limits given, which gives $1/c^2$ or 0.25 Å$^2$. The time-dependent part has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2, so the integral over time gives 2. Combining these we obtain a probability of 0.000500, or answer (C).

 The energy of a photon is given by $E = h\nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\nu$ is the frequency of the light. The energy of the absorbed photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, therefore the shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy. The energy of the emitted photon will be lower, and thus the wavelength longer. The energy difference between the absorbed and emitted photon will be used to promote the electron to a higher energy level. We know that the energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by $E_{n} = -\frac{h^{2}}{8\pi^{2}m_{e}e^{4}n^{2}}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number. We need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $E_{n}$ is larger than the energy of the absorbed photon and smaller than the energy of the emitted photon. The energy of the absorbed photon is higher than that of the ground state, $n = 1$, since the wavelength is shorter than the Lyman limit of $121 \mathrm{~nm}$.

Since $\Delta U = 0$, we have that $\Delta T = 0$, which means that the final and initial temperature are the same, and any heat lost by the sample will be equal to the work done on it. The work done in a reversible process is given by $W = -P_{\mathrm{ext}} \Delta V$, where $P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is the pressure exerted externally on the gas to perform the compression.

Heterolysis, on the other hand, is the cleavage of a covalent bond into two ions, one of which has a full electron octet. The Cl-Cl bond is nonpolar, which means that the electronegativity of the two chlorine atoms is the same. This means that in a heterolytic cleavage, one of the chlorine atoms would be left with an incomplete octet, which is energetically unfavorable. Option (A) is the correct answer.

Therefore the number of moles of water vapor will decrease to $n = 55.5 \cdot 30/1000 = 16.65$ moles. When we add NaCl, the vapor pressure will remain constant at 30 mmHg, but the volume will increase to maintain the pressure at 10 atm. According to Raoult's law, the molar vapor pressure of the solution is given by $P = xP_{\text{solvent}}$, where x is the mole fraction of the solvent. We can assume that the molar volume of the solution will remain close to that of water, which is 18 cm^3/mol. Therefore the number of moles of solution will increase to $n = 16.65 \cdot 1000/18 =

We are given $E^{\circ}$ and $T$, and we can assume that the reaction quotient $Q$ is equal to the concentration of HCl, since the concentration of silver chloride is essentially constant. We also know that the number of electrons transferred, $n$, is 1, and the molar gas constant $R$ and Faraday's constant $F$ have known numerical values. We can solve for the pH as follows: $E = 0.2220 - \frac{(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \cdot 300 \, \text{K})}{1 \, \text{mol} \cdot 96485 \, \text{C/mol}} \ln [\text{HCl}]$.

 a) The change in enthalpy for the melting of one mole of the acid is given by the heat of fusion multiplied by the molar mass. This is equal to $2700 \cdot 60 = 162000$ cal. The heat required to melt one gram of the acid is therefore $162000 / 60 = 2700$ cal/g. The heat required to melt the solid at its melting point is therefore equal to the heat of fusion multiplied by the difference in densities, or $2700 \cdot (1.10 - 1.05) = 1350$ cal/g. This heat is equal to the heat lost by the liquid, which is equal to the product of the mass of the liquid and its specific heat capacity times the change in temperature. We therefore have $m \cdot C \cdot \Delta T = 1350$, or $\Delta T = 1350 / (60 \cdot 1.8) = 12.5$°C. The new melting point is therefore $16 - 12.5 = 3.

We can solve for the energy difference and then use the equation $E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 m L^2}$ to solve for $L$.

 The Lyman series is associated with transitions from the n = 1 energy level to higher energy levels. The series limit corresponds to the transition to the highest energy level, or n = infinity. Using the Rydberg equation, we find that $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{\infty} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^{2}} \right)$. We substitute n = infinity and solve for $\lambda$. $\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{\infty}$, or $\lambda = \frac{1}{R_{\infty}}$. The Rydberg constant for hydrogen, $R_{\infty}$, is equal to 109677 cm^{-1}. Therefore $\lambda = 91.17 \text{ nm}$. The energy of the photon is given by E = hf, where f is the frequency, which is the reciprocal of the wavelength.

 We are told that the process is isothermal, which means that the temperature is constant and we can use the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$.

 The Joule-Thomson coefficient is defined as $\mu = \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_{v,h}$. We are told that the process is adiabatic, which means that $h$ is constant. We are also told that the process is isenthalpic, which means that $d h=0$, or that the enthalpy change is zero. This means that we can write $\Delta h=w=P \Delta V=0$, which means that the work done is zero, and the process is reversible. For a reversible process $\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_{v}=\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_{s}$. We can therefore write $\mu=\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_{s}$. Using the ideal gas law, we can write $T d S=C_{P} d T$, where $C_P$ is the constant-pressure heat capacity. Integrating this equation from the initial to the final state, and noting that $\Delta S=0$ for a reversible process, we obtain $\Delta T=C_{P} \ln \left(\

 First, we must calculate the heat lost by the hot block and the heat gained by the cold block. The heat lost by the hot block is given by $q_\mathrm{lost} = mc\Delta T$, or $q_\mathrm{lost} = 10.0 \mathrm{~kg} \cdot 0.385 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~g}^{-1} \cdot (100^{\circ} \mathrm{C} - 50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}) = 19250 \mathrm{~J}$. The heat gained by the cold block is also $19250 \mathrm{~J}$. This heat flows from the hot block to the cold block, so the entropy change of the hot block is negative and that of the cold block is positive. The total change in entropy is therefore $\Delta S_\mathrm{tot} = \Delta S_\mathrm{hot} + \Delta S_\mathrm{cold}$. Using the formula $\Delta S = \frac{q_\mathrm{rev

 First, we must convert the energy from TNT into Joules, which is 4.6 × 10^9 J. Next, we must determine the amount of energy released by the combustion of 1 mole of acetylene.

 The reaction is endothermic, which means that increasing the temperature will favour the formation of the products. However, we are also told that the reaction forms a dimer, which means that the reaction vessel's volume will decrease as the reaction proceeds. According to Le Châtelier's principle, this will also favour the formation of products. Therefore the best option is (A).

 First we write the equation for a first order reaction, $-d[A]/dt = k[A]$. We integrate this equation to obtain $ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]_0$, or $[A] = [A]_0e^{-kt}$. Here, $k = 86 \, h^{-1} = 86 \cdot 3600 \, s^{-1}$. The reaction starts with 0.0500 g of material, or $[A]_0 = 0.0500 \, mol$.

 The molar mass is given by the density times the unit cell volume divided by the number of formula units per unit cell. The volume of the unit cell is $(12.3 \mathrm{~nm})^3 = 2.23 \cdot 10^6 \mathrm{~nm}^3$. The density times this volume gives the mass of one unit cell, which is equal to $2.23 \cdot 10^{-9} \cdot 1.287 = 2.86 \cdot 10^{-7} \mathrm{~g}$.

The heat absorbed or released is given by $\Delta Q = nC_{\mathrm{v}} \Delta T$, where $C_{\mathrm{v}}$ is the molar heat capacity at constant volume. We can compute the change in pressure as $\Delta P = \frac{\Delta Q}{V} = \frac{nC_{\mathrm{v}} \Delta T}{V}$. We can compute the number of moles from the pressure and ideal gas law, $n = \frac{P V}{R T}$. Substituting, we obtain $\Delta P = \frac{P C_{\mathrm{v}} \Delta T}{R T}$.

The boiling point elevation constant is $\Delta T = i \cdot m$ where $i$ is the van't Hoff factor, taken to be 1 for non-electrolytes, and $m$ is the molality of the solution. We therefore have $\Delta T = 1 \cdot 3.99 \approx 4$ °C. The boiling point of water is 100°C, therefore the boiling point of the solution is approximately 104°C. The answer is closest to (A).

 The decrease in vapour pressure is caused by the solute particles interfering with the evaporation of the solvent. This phenomenon is described by Raoult's law, which states that the vapour pressure of the solution is given by the product of the vapour pressure of the solvent and the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution. We write this as $P_{\text {solution }}=P_{\text {solvent }} \cdot x_{\text {solvent }}$. The decrease in vapour pressure is thus given by $\Delta P=P_{\text {solvent }}\left(1-x_{\text {solvent }}\right)$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the mole fraction of the solvent, $x_{\text {solvent }}=1-\frac{\Delta P}{P_{\text {solvent }}}$. The mass of the solvent is $500 \mathrm{~g}$, and its molar mass is approximately $78 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. The mole fraction of the solute is thus $\frac{19.0}{500+19.0}=0.038$.

 The rate of diffusion is proportional to the square root of the molar mass. We have $M(NH_3) = 17$ and $M(HF) = 20$ and $M(HCl) = 36.5$.

 Adiabatic processes are characterized by $\Delta T \cdot C_V = -\Delta W$. In this case, work is done on the surroundings, so $\Delta W$ is negative.

 The enthalpy of combustion is the sum of the enthalpy of the formation of the products minus the enthalpy of the formation of the reactants. We are given the enthalpy of the formation of propane, and we need to compute the enthalpy of the formation of propene. The difference between the two will be the enthalpy of combustion. The enthalpy of formation of a compound is equal to its standard enthalpy change, which means that the enthalpy of formation of propene is +124 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of formation of carbon dioxide and water are respectively -393.5 and -285.8 kJ/mol. Multiplying these by the coefficients in the given equation for the combustion of propane, we obtain the enthalpy of formation of the products as -2222 - (-393.5) $\cdot 3 - (-285.8) \cdot 4 = -1810.1$ kJ/mol.

 First, we need to calculate the value of $\gamma B$ for the two lines. We know that $\Delta \nu = \gamma \Delta B$, and we are told that $\Delta \nu = 280$ MHz and $\nu = 9.5$ GHz, so $\gamma = \frac{280}{9500} \approx 3 \cdot 10^{-4} \, \text{MHz/T}$. We also know that the separation of the lines is due to the nuclear spin interaction, so the separation is given by $2I \cdot \gamma B$, where $I =

 We are given the mass and the final volume of methane, and we know the initial volume is 0 $\mathrm{dm}^3$ since it is a sample of gas at STP. We can therefore calculate the molar mass of methane and subsequently the number of moles. Using the ideal gas law, we can then calculate the final pressure. Work done is given by $W = -P_{\mathrm{ext}} \Delta V$, where $P_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is the external pressure, which is 1 atm, or 101.3 kPa. We can then calculate the work done. The answer is $-167$ $\mathrm{J}$, or (D).

 We are told that the gas expands adiabatically against an external pressure, which means that we can use the adiabatic equation, $\left(P V^{\gamma}\right)_{\text {initial }}=\left(P V^{\gamma}\right)_{\text {final }}$.

We also know the final volume, which is $0.02 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \cdot 20 \mathrm{~cm}=0.4 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

 We can calculate the partial pressure of water vapour in the room using the relative humidity. Relative humidity is defined as $\left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}}{P_{\mathrm{sat}}}\right) \times 100 \%$, where $P_{\mathrm{sat}}$ is the vapour pressure of water at the given temperature. At $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the vapour pressure of water is approximately 3700 Pa. Therefore the partial pressure of water vapour in the room is $2220 \mathrm{Pa}$. We can then use the ideal gas equation to calculate the number of moles of water vapour present in the room. $PV = nRT \Rightarrow n = \frac{P V}{R T}$. Here, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. This gives us $n = 0.0222 \mathrm{mol}$.

 We perform three experiments, changing the concentrations of reactants A and B. The rate of the reaction is proportional to the amount of product formed per unit of time, which we measure in each experiment. We see that when the concentration of A is doubled, the rate quadruples, and when the concentration of B is doubled, the rate sextuplets. This means that the rate law must be of the form rate = k [A]^n [B]^m, where n and m are both even integers. We now perform a few experiments to determine the exact values of n and m. We start with 2 and 4, which indeed give us the correct rate increase when multiplied by the concentrations of A and B. This means that the rate law is rate = k [A]^2 [B]^4, or the answer (I).

 The equation for the freezing point depression is $\Delta T_f = iK_f \cdot m$, where $i$ is the van't Hoff factor, taken to be 1 for simplicity, $K_f$ is the freezing point depression constant, and $m$ is the molarity of the solution. We can rewrite this equation as $\Delta T_f = \frac{m}{M} \cdot 0.500$, where $M$ is the molar mass of the solute. We know that $\Delta T_f = 0.125$ and $m = \frac{26.4 \text{ g}}{250 \text{ g soln}} \cdot 1000 \text{ g/kg} = 10.56 \text{ kg/mol}$. Substituting, we obtain $10.56 = \frac{10.56}{M} \cdot 0.500$, which gives us $M = 528 \text{ g/mol}$. The answer is closest to (A).

 The osmotic pressure is related to the concentration of the solution by the equation $\pi = CRT$, where $\pi$ is the osmotic pressure, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. We can rewrite this equation as $\pi/RT = C$. The concentration $C$ is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, which in this case is $n/V = 0.018$. Substituting this into the equation above, we find that $\pi/RT = 0.018$. We can solve for the molar mass of the sugar by multiplying both sides by $RT$ and rearranging the equation. The osmotic pressure is given as 2.46 atm, the temperature is 27°C, or 300 K, and the universal gas constant is 0.0821 $\frac{\text{L atm}}{\text{mol K}}$. Therefore $0.018 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 300 \cdot \text{M} = 2.46$, which gives us M = 360 g/mol.

The answer is out of range. We should consider that the compound might have been collected as a solution, which would mean that some of the mass is due to the solvent. We know that the boiling point of water is 100°C, and the compound boils at 65°C, which means that the compound is likely more volatile than water. We can assume that the solvent is likely to be less volatile than water, and therefore the boiling point of the solution is likely to be somewhere in between these two values. We'll assume for the sake of argument that the solvent boils at 80°

 The Nernst equation is given by $E = E^{\circ} - \frac{RT}{zF}lnQ$. For concentration cells, the reaction quotient $Q$ is given by the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. In this case, the reaction is 2HCl(aq) $\rightleftharpoons$ H2(g) + 2H+ + 2Cl-. The reaction quotient is then $Q = [H^{+}]^{2}[Cl^{-}]^{2}$. We can solve for the equilibrium constant, $K$, by setting the equation equal to 1 and solving for the exponent of $[H^{+}]$. We find that $[H^{+}] = 0.0118$. The transference number, $\alpha$, is given by the ratio of the actual current, $I$, to the maximum possible current, which is the total concentration of ions multiplied by the number of electrons transferred, $F$.

 We are given the enthalpy changes for the two reactions shown, and we need to find the enthalpy change for the formation of NaHCO3 from its elements. We start with the first reaction, and add the enthalpy of the products to both sides of the equation.

We solve for $\Delta H°_{Na_2CO_3}$ to obtain $-325.4$ kcal/mol. For the second reaction we write $NaHCO_3(s) \rightarrow Na^+ + HCO_3^-$ and use Hess's law to add the enthalpy of formation of the products to both sides.

One ampere is one coulomb per second, so in five minutes we have $5 \cdot 60 \cdot 1\, C = 300\, C$ of charge.

 We are given the ideal gas equation, $PV = nRT$. We know that the number of moles didn't change, so $n$ is constant. We also know that the product of $P$ and $V$ is constant. Therefore, if the volume increased, the pressure must have decreased. We are also given the atomic weight of chlorine, which means that its molar mass is approximately 35.5 g/mol. The mass of chlorine decreased by 0.7 g, which means that 0.7/35.5 moles left the bulb. The bulb originally contained 7.1 - x moles of gas, and after heating x moles. The difference is 0.7/35.5, which means that the original amount was $x +

 The half-life of $^{14}C$ is 5,730 years. We can use the formula $t_{1/2} = \frac{ln 2}{\lambda}$ to find the decay constant $\lambda$. We get $\lambda = 0.00136$. The activity $A$ is related to the number of disintegrations per unit mass and time by $A = -\frac{dN}{dt}$. The change in the number of radioactive nuclei over time is given by $N(t) = N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$. Integrating this equation between 0 and t gives us $N(t) - N(0) = -N_{0}(e^{-\lambda t} - 1)$. We can then write the activity as $A = -\lambda N_{0}e^{-\lambda t}$. We are told that $A = 6.6$ and $t = 7000$ years. Substituting these values together with the known value of $\lambda$ gives us $N_{0}e^{-0.00136 \cdot 7000}

We know that the number of moles is 3.0 mol, and that the molar mass of Ar is 40 g/mol, so the mass is simply $m = 3.0 \cdot 40 \mathrm{~g} = 120 \mathrm{~g}$. We can now solve for $c_v$: $$q = 120 \mathrm{~g} \cdot c_v \cdot 2.55 \mathrm{~K} = 229 \mathrm{~J} \Rightarrow c_v =

 First, we need to compute the amount of baking soda used in moles. The molar mass of NaHCO3 is approximately 84 g/mol, so 4.2 g is equivalent to 4.2 / 84 = 0.05 moles. According to the balanced equation, one mole of NaHCO3 produces one mole of CO2. Therefore, 0.05 moles of CO2 should be produced. At STP, 1 mole of any gas occupies 2.24 L, so at 273 K and 1 atm this volume will be larger. The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$, and we can solve for the volume $V$ as $V =

The ionization constants of the amino acids are given in the question as pK' values, which are related to the ionization constants K' by taking the negative logarithm, or $K' = 10^{\text{pK'}}$. We can set up the ionization equilibrium for each amino acid as follows: $\ce{HA <=> H+ + A-}$. The pH can then be calculated as $pH = -\log\left(\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}\right)$. We can substitute the ionization constant K' for the ratio of ionized and non-ionized forms to obtain $pH = -\log(K') + \log([HA])$. Using the given pK' values and setting [HA] to 1, we obtain the following pH values:

We then obtain $0.750 / T_1 = 2.00 / T_2$. Multiplying both sides by $T_2$ and rearranging, we obtain $T_2 = 2.00 \cdot 0.750 \cdot T_1 / 2.00 = 1.50 \cdot T_1$. We know that $P_1V_1 = nRT_1$ and $P_2V_2 = nRT_2$, and since the amount of gas didn't change, we can equate the number of moles, giving us $0.399 \cd

We do this by adding the heat required to vaporize the water, which is $\Delta H_{vap} = 44$ kJ/mol or 105.6 kcal/mol. The heat of formation of H2O(g) is therefore $-64.4 + 105.6 = -41.2$ kcal/mol. Next, we need to convert everything to moles. We have that 1 mole of C10H8 produces 1226.7 kcal of heat, and we can use this as our reference point. We also have that 4 moles of H2O are produced in the reaction, which means that each mole of water produces $\frac{1226.7}{4} = 306.68$ kcal of heat.

 First, we need to calculate the amount of energy in moles that can be obtained from ATP. We are given that 1 g of muscle contains $5 \cdot 10^{-6}$ mole of ATP. The enthalpy change for the hydrolysis of ATP is -30.5 kJ/mol, or -7.3 kcal/mol. Therefore the energy stored in the ATP in 1 g of muscle is $(-7.3 \text{ kcal/mol})(5 \cdot 10^{-6} \text{ mol}) = -36.5$ kcal/g. Next, we need to calculate the energy stored in phosphocreatine. The enthalpy change for the reaction $PCr

The molar mass of the protein is 69,000 g/mol, so the number of particles is $n = 0.02\, \text{mol} \cdot 69,000\, \text{g}\, \text{mol}^{-1} = 1.38 \cdot 10^{-3}\, \text{mol}$. The osmotic pressure is given by the equation $\pi = nRT$, where R is the ideal gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We can find its mass by considering a spherical shell with thickness 100 km and radius 6.37 × 10^6 m. The mass of the homosphere, $m$, is then given by $m = \rho V$, where $\rho$ is the density of air and $V$ is the volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is given by $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 h$, where $h$ is the thickness of the shell, or 100 km = 100000/1000 m. Substituting the values we obtain $m =

 One cubic millimeter is equivalent to one milliliter, which is $10^{-3} L$. The area of the oil film is 1 square meter, or 10,000 square centimeters. Therefore the volume to area ratio is $10^{-3} \, L / 10,000 \, cm^2 = 10^{-6} \, \text{L/cm}^2$. The density of oil is close to that of water, which is 1 g/mL or 1 g/cm$^3$. Therefore the mass of the oil film is also $10^{-6} \, \text{g/cm}^2$. The atomic mass unit is approximately 1 u, and 1 u is equivalent to 1 Dalton, which in turn is approximately 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

The magnetic moment of an electron is given by $\mu = g \cdot \mu_{B}$, where $g$ is the g-factor and $\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton, or $\mu_{B} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24}$ erg gauss$^{-1}$. The g-factor for Ti^3+ is 1.606. Therefore, the magnetic moment of the ion is $\mu = 1.606 \times 9.274 \times 10^{-24} = 1.606 \times 10^{-22}$ erg gauss$^{-1}$. This is (A).

For the molar magnetic susceptibility, we use the relation $\chi = \frac{\mu}{N \cdot \mu_{B}}$. Here, N is the number of unpaired electrons, which is 1 in this case. Therefore, $\chi = \frac{1.606 \times 10^{-22}}{1 \cdot 9.274 \times

We can assume that the solubility of Mg(OH)2 is sufficiently low that we can assume $[Mg^{2+}] = [OH^{-}]$. Therefore, we have $[Mg^{2+}] = \sqrt{8.9 \cdot 10^{-12}} = 3.0 \cdot 10^{-6}$. This corresponds to a solubility of $1.1 \cdot 10^{-4}$ mol/L. Now we consider the solubility in 0.05M NaOH. We have $[OH^{-}] = 0.05$ and $[Mg^{2+}] = 3.0 \cdot 10^{-6}$.

 The reaction rate is proportional to the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy to react, which is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The fraction of molecules with energy greater than the activation energy, $f$, is given by $f = N e^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$. The rate constant, $k$, is proportional to this fraction, so we have $k \propto e^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain $\ln k = -\frac{E_{a}}{RT}$. Differentiating with respect to temperature, we obtain $\frac{d \ln k}{d T} = \frac{E_a}{R T^2}$. We are told that $\frac{d \ln k}{d T} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{kT_0}$, where $T_0$ is the initial temperature, or 0°C, or 273.15 K.

 The ionization energy of sodium is the energy required to remove an electron from the sodium atom. The electron affinity of chlorine is the energy released when an electron is added to the chlorine atom. When sodium loses an electron and chlorine gains it, the energy difference between these two values is the energy change of the system. We have $E_{\mathrm{NaCl}} = 5.14 \mathrm{eV} - 3.61 \mathrm{eV} = 1.53 \mathrm{eV}$. This is the energy required to pull the electron from sodium to infinity, or half the energy required to break the Na-Cl bond. The other half comes from the electron affinity of chlorine, giving us a total of $1.53 \mathrm{eV} + 3.61 \mathrm{eV} = 5.14 \mathrm{eV}$. Dividing by two to find the energy required to break half of the Na-Cl bonds gives us an answer of 2.57 eV, or (G).

If instead we add 0.3 moles of NaOH, we are now adding OH^- ions to the solution. These will react with the H^+ ions present, which are 0.00597 moles, shifting the solution towards the basic side. The final pH will be approximately 9.2. Therefore the answers are (A) and (E) respectively.

 First we will calculate the volume of the cell. The volume of a cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. We have that $r = 0.5\mu$ and $h = 2.0\mu$, so the volume is $V = 1\mu^3$. The density of water is 1g/mL, or 1g/cm^3, so the mass of the water in the cell is 1g. The molar mass of water is 18g/mol, so the number of moles of water in the cell is 0.001mol. The pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration, so at pH 6.4 we have that $[H^+] = 10^{-6.4} = 1.84 \cdot 10^{-7}$. Multiply this by the number of moles of water to obtain the number of H^+ ions in the cell, which is equal to 1.84x10^(-5)mol, or 18400 molecules. Each H^

 We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to solve this question. $ln(P_{2} / P_{1}) = \Delta H / (R \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1}))$. Here, the pressures and temperatures of the two substances are the same, so the left-hand side of the equation is zero. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\Delta H$. $\Delta H = -R \cdot ln(P) \cdot (T_{2} - T_{1})$. We are given the heat of vaporization in joules per mole, so we need to convert the pressure to atmospheres and the temperature to Kelvin. $P = 0.132 \, atm = 0.132 \cdot 101325 \, Pa$. $T = 15^{\circ}C = 298 \, K$.

 We can use the equation $\Delta T = i \cdot m$, where $\Delta T$ is the change in freezing point, $i$ is the freezing point constant, and $m$ is the molality of the solution. First we compute the molality of the solution. The solution has a mass of 150 g benzene + 25.1 g solute = 175.1 g solution. The molar mass of benzene is approximately 78 g/mol, so the number of moles of benzene is 150 g / 78 g/mol = 1.92 moles. The total mass in moles is then 1.92 + x, where x is the number of moles of the solute. The molality is then x / 175.1 g solution / 1000 g/mol = 0.0146 mol/kg. The change in freezing point is then $-1.92^\circ$C - $5.50^\circ$C = -3.42°C. Using the equation above we find $-3.42^\circ$C = $5.10 \

 The intensity of light is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the diver. This in turn is proportional to the concentration of chromophores in the water, which absorb light. The concentration of chromophores is given by the equation $c = \frac{n}{V}$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $V$ is the volume. The volume of water that the light passes through is simply the product of the cross-sectional area of the diver, $A$, and the distance traveled, $d$. Therefore the intensity of light is proportional to $\frac{n}{d}$. We can compute the amount of light absorbed using the molar absorptivity, $\epsilon$, which is defined as $\epsilon = \frac{1}{lc}$, where $l$ is the path length. Combining these two equations we get $\frac{n}{d} \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon d}$. We can solve for $d$ to obtain $d \propto \frac{n}{\epsilon}$. We are told that at half the surface intensity, $I_{\mathrm{half}} = \frac{1}{2} I_{\mathrm{surface}}$. Therefore $\frac{n

 First, we will solve part (1). The rate constant is proportional to $e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}$. If we assume that the activation energy is independent of temperature, then the ratio of the rate constants at 60°C and 30°C is given by $$\frac{k_{60^\circ C}}{k_{30^\circ C}} = 
rac{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT_{60^\circ C}}}}{e^{-\frac{E_a}{RT_{30^\circ C}}}. We can then solve for $E_a$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides, which results in $ln(\frac{k_{60^\circ C}}{k_{30^\circ C}}) = -\frac{E_a}{RT_{30^\circ C}}(\frac{1}{T_{30^\circ C}} - \frac{1}{T_{60^\circ C}})$. We can insert numerical values for the temperatures and the gas constant, which gives us $ln(5) = -\frac{E_a}{1882 \, cal \

 The rate constant $k$ is related to the activation energy $E_a$ and the temperature $T$ by the Arrhenius equation: $k = A \cdot e^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $E_a$: $$E_a = -R \cdot T \cdot ln(k)$. We are given two values for $k$ and the temperature associated with each. We can solve for $E_a$ in each case and then take the difference of the two values to find the activation energy.

For the first case, we have $E_a = -RT \cdot ln(0.105) = 2.0407 \cdot 10^5 \, J/mol$. For the second case, we have $E_a = -RT \cdot ln(0.343) = 1.8407 \cdot 10^5 \, J/mol$. The activation energy is then the difference of these two values: $2.0407 - 1.8407 = 0.20 \cdot

At equilibrium, the concentration of $\ce{Na^+}$ will equal the concentration of $\ce{H^+}$. The concentration of $\ce{C2H3O2^-}$ will equal the concentration of $\ce{Cl^-}$, which

 The percent ionic character of a bond is given by the formula $\frac{u_{obs}^2}{u_{obs}^2 + u_{calc}^2} \cdot 100\%$, where $u_{calc}$ is the dipole moment calculated assuming 100% covalent character. The calculated dipole moment is given by $\mu = ed$, where $e$ is the electron charge and $d$ is the bond distance in centimeters. We first convert the bond distance to centimeters, which is equal to 1.28 \AA × 10^{-8} cm/1 \AA = 1.28 × 10^{-2} cm.

 The freezing point depression is given by the equation $\Delta T = \frac{K_f \cdot i}{M}$, where $K_f$ is the freezing point depression constant, $i$ is the molality of the solution, and $M$ is the molar mass of the solute. We know $\Delta T$ and $K_f$ and can solve for $i$. First we convert the mass of the solute and solvent to molality. The mass of the solute is 2.00 g and the molar mass is unknown, but we'll call it $M$. The molality is then $i = 2.00 \, \text{g} / 2.00 \, \text{L} = 1.00 \, \text{mol/kg}$. The mass of the solvent is 10.00 g and the molar mass of water is 18.02 g/mol, giving a molality of solvent of $10.00 \, \text{g} / 18.02 \, \text{kg} = 0.5556 \, \text{mol/kg}

The molar mass of $V_2O_5$ is 181.9 g/mol, and the given mass of $V_2O3$ is 2 g, which is equivalent to 0.0109 moles. This means that 0.0109 moles of $V_2O5$ can be produced, or 2.00 g, answer (E).

 First we calculate the pH of the original solution. We have the ionization constant of acetic acid, $K_a = 1.75 \cdot 10^{-5}$. We also know that the concentration of the solution is 0.5 M with respect to the acid and its conjugate base. We first find the concentration of the hydrogen ion, $[H^+] = K_a \cdot [CH_3COOH] = 1.75 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot 0.5 = 8.75 \cdot 10^{-6} M$. The pH is then calculated as $pH = -log[H^+] = 5.52$. The solution before the addition of hydrochloric acid has a pH of 5.52, or (G). After the addition of hydrochloric acid the concentration of hydrogen ions increases to 0.11 M, which leads to a pH of 1.10. The solution after the addition of hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1.10, or (H).

 Heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_P$, is given by the equation: $C_P = nR$, where $n$ is the number of atoms in the molecule and $R$ is the universal gas constant. For carbon, there is one atom in the molecule, so $C_P = R$. For hydrogen gas, there are two atoms in the molecule, so $C_P = 2R$. Water has three atoms, so $C_P = 3R$. Carbon dioxide has four atoms, giving $C_P = 4R$. Therefore the heat capacities are: C(s): 6 cal K^-1mol^-1, H_2(g): 8 cal K^-1mol^-1, H_2O(g): 9 cal K^-1mol^-1, and CO_2(g): 12 cal K^-1mol^-1. We are also told that the vibrational mode contributes 20% to the heat capacity of water, which means that the rotational mode contributes 80%, or 7.2 cal K^-1mol^-1.

Since EXE uses STP to check constraints, it would not make sense for EXE to pause the execution until the query is resolved, so we can eliminate answer C.

 We are given that $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ forms a Markov chain, which means that $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent given $Y$. This means that we can write the mutual information $I(X;Z) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$.
Next, we know that jointly Gaussian random variables have entropy given by $H(X,Y) = \frac{1}{2} \log_2 (2\pi e |\Sigma|)$, where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. Since the entropy of a joint distribution is the sum of the entropies of the individual random variables minus the mutual information between them, we have that $H(X) + H(Y) = \frac{1}{2} \log_2 (2\pi e) + I(X;Y)$.
Since the correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$ is 0.1, the covariance matrix is $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0.1 \\ 0.1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, so $H(X) + H(Y) = 1.042$ bits.

 We can solve this problem by induction. First, we can see that T(2) = 3 * 1 + 7 = 10, T(3) = 3 * 3 + 10 = 31, and T(4) = 3 * 9 + 31 = 52. We can see that T(n) is increasing quickly, and in fact T(n) = 3n(n - 1) / 2 + 7, which is O(n^2).
We can prove this by induction. First, we know that T(1) = 7, which is O(1), and T(n + 1) = O(n^2), so the base case holds. Next, assume that T(k) is O(k^2) for some arbitrary but fixed k. Then, we have that T(k + 1) = 3(k + 1)k / 2 + 7, which is asymptotically equal to 3k^2 / 2, which is O(k^2), which means that our inductive hypothesis holds. By the principle of mathematical induction, we can

 The first layer of the CNN has 4 filters, each of size 5x5. To calculate the number of weights, we first calculate the number of weights in a single filter. A filter of size 5x5 has 5 * 5 = 25 weights. Since there are 4 filters, the total number of weights is 4 * 25 = 100 weights.
Next, we must account for the zero-padding. The input image has size 32x32, and the filter has size 5x5 with a stride of 2. This means that each filter is convolved across the input image in steps of 2 pixels, and at each step a 1-pixel wide border of zeros is added around the filter. This means that the effective size of the input image to each filter is (32 + 1) x (32 + 1) = 33x33.
The number of locations where the filter is applied is the height of the filter multiplied by the width of the (padded) input, or 5 * 33 = 165 locations. Since each location uses one weight from each filter, the total number of weights defined

The target keys for a node are the keys that are mapped to the node in the DHT. The mapping function for a Chord DHT is:
key(nid) = hash(nid) + (nid/2^k)
where k is the number of bits in the node identifier.
For example, the target keys for node N11 are the keys whose hash values are in the range [hash(N11), hash(N11) + 2^(11/2^6) - 1].
We can see that the target keys for N1 are the keys whose hash values are in the range [hash(N1), hash(N1) + 2^(1/2^6) - 1] = [hash(N1), hash(N1) + 15].
Since the node identifiers are 6 bits long, the largest possible hash value is 63. Thus, the largest possible value of hash(N1) + 15 is 78.
Therefore, the target keys for N1 are the keys whose values are in the range [hash(N1), 78].

where the maximization is over all possible input distributions $p(x)$ and the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ is the difference between the entropy of the output and the conditional entropy of the output given the input.
Since the channel adds Gaussian noise, the output $Y$ given the input $X=x$ is distributed as $N(x,1)$, and so $p(y|x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(y-x)^2}{2}}$. Also, because the noise is independent of the input, the output distribution $p(y)$ is just the marginal distribution of $Y$, which is $p(y) = \int p(x) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(y-x)^2}{2}} dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2

 The equation of the filter can be rewritten as:
$y(n) - x(n) / 3 = x(n-1) / 3 + x(n-2) / 3$
We can see that the left side of the equation is equal to the current output sample minus one-third of the current input sample. The right side of the equation is a weighted average of the two previous input samples. This means that the filter output depends only on past inputs and not on the current or future inputs, which is the definition of a causal filter.
Next, we can rewrite the filter equation in the standard form:
$y(n) = ay(n-1) + bx(n-1) + cx(n-2)$

 We are given that the object is convex, which means that all vertices are outward-facing and no vertices are shared between two faces. We are also given that all faces are regular, which means that all faces have the same number of sides.
We can see that each vertex is shared by two faces, and that each face has three vertices. Thus, the number of vertices is twice the sum of the number of pentagons and hexagons.
We can also see that each face requires three edges, and each edge is shared by two faces. Thus, the number of edges is half the sum of the number of pentagons and hexagons.
Since a pentagon has five sides and a hexagon has six sides, we can see that the number of sides in all pentagons is 5k and the number of sides in all hexagons is 6m. Adding these together, we get 11k+6m sides total. Since each side is shared by two faces, dividing by two gives us 5.5k+3m edges. But we know that the number of edges is half the number of vertices, so 5.5k+3m = k+m.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. First, we need to find the profit function, which is given by:
π = TR - TC = Pq - (q + .02q^2)
= (15 - .05q)q - (.01q^2 - q)
= 15q - .06q^2
Now, we can find the profit maximization point by equating the marginal revenue to marginal cost:
MR = MC, or .05q = .01q, which implies q* = 10.
Substituting q* = 10 into the profit function, we have:
π* = 15(10) - .06(10^2) = 150 - 6 = 144.
a) The profit maximization point is q* = 10, P* = 15 - .05(10) = 10.
b) Now, let's consider the tax. The new profit function is:
π = 15q - .06q^2 - .01q = 14.

The break-even point is the level of income at which consumption equals saving. That means that at the break-even point, the amount of consumption is equal to the amount of saving.
Now, we know that the income is $10,000 and the break-even point is$8,000. Therefore, the difference between income and the break-even point is $2,000. Multiplying this difference by the marginal propensity to consume, we get the increase in consumption due to the increase in income. That is,$2,000 * 1/2 = $1,000. Adding this increase in consumption to the break-even consumption level, we get the total consumption at the income level of$10,000. That is, consumption is $8,000 +$1,000 = $9,000. The amount

Total withdrawals = (1 - MPC) * Total Output + Income Tax Revenue
We know that MPC = 0.90 and the income tax rate is 0.26. Thus, we have:

Total withdrawals = 0.1 * Total Output + 0.26 * Total Output
Total withdrawals = 0.36 * Total Output

Standard error of the regression coefficient = sqrt((1 - R^2) / n)
where R^2 is the coefficient of determination and n is the sample size.
We know that R^2 = 0.16 and n = 200. Thus, we have:

Next, we use the fact that the specific humidity is constant in a dry adiabatic process to find the final specific humidity: 0.00802 = \frac{T_f}{T_0} \gamma_f, so \gamma_f = 0.00802 * 85/60 = 0.00902 lbm vapor/lbm dry air.

 We can calculate the heat transfer by using the enthalpy change of the reaction, which is given by the difference between the enthalpies of the products and reactants. We have that \Delta H_f(CO_2) = -393.5 kJ/mol, \Delta H_f(H_2O) = -285.8 kJ/mol, and \Delta H_f(N_2) = 0 kJ/mol. So the enthalpy change of the reaction is -393.5 kJ/mol - 2*(-285.8 kJ/mol) = -554.1 kJ/mol. Multiplying by 3.5 to account for the stoichiometric coefficient gives -1939.35 kJ/mol, or 193935 J/mol.

 First, we calculate the amount of heat evolved in the reaction, which is 18000 lb Btu / 78.11 lb/lb mole = 230.21 Btu/lb mole. Then, we calculate the heat of reaction at 77°F using the formula q = mΔH_77°F + mRTln(P_f/P_i), where P_f and P_i are the final and initial pressures, both taken at 1 atm, and R and T are the universal gas constant and temperature in Fahrenheit, respectively. We obtain 230.21 = ΔH_77°F + RTln(1), which gives us ΔH_77°F = 230.21 - RTln(1) = 230.21 - RT. Plugging in R = 0.2381 Btu/(lbmol·°F) and T = 77°F = 443.6 R, we obtain ΔH_77°F = -1.40598 × 10^6 Btu/lbmol. The answer is

 First, we calculate the amount of water in the air. We know that the relative humidity is 48%, so the amount of water vapor is 0.48 kg/kg of dry air. The molar mass of dry air is approximately 29 g/mol, so 1 kg of dry air is about 34.5 moles. 0.48 kg of water vapor is about 3.45 moles. Now, we know that CO_2 takes up 13% of the volume, O_2 3.1%, N_2 83.6% and CO 0.3%. We can calculate the number of moles of each gas produced in the combustion reaction; adding these together and dividing by 2 (since two moles of air are required per mole of CO_2 produced) gives us the number of moles of air consumed, which is about 17.25 moles. We can now calculate the stoichiometric coefficient of air required for complete combustion, which turns out to be 34.5. Dividing this number by the number of moles of air actually used gives us the percentage of theoretical air used, which is 120.3%. To calculate the carbon

 We can use the analogy between electrical and fluid circuits to solve this problem.

Using the Colburn analogy, we can equate the electrical resistance to the fluid resistance, so 8\ell /(\pi D) = 4\ell R_e /(\pi r^2) => R_e = 15. Then, using the Prandtl analogy, we can equate the electrical power to the rate of heat transfer, so Q = (V^2/R)/2 = hLD(\theta_2 - \theta_1)/2, which gives us \theta_2 - \theta_1 = V^2 R /(hLD) = (120 V)^2 * 1/(2 \times 470 W/(m^2 K) \times 9 ft \times 0.0625 m)

 First, we calculate the heat required to melt the ice: 1 lbm * 144 Btu/lbm = 144 Btu. Then we calculate the heat lost by the liquid water as it cools down from 80 to x °F: 6 lbm * 1 Btu/lbm-°F * (80 - x) °F = 48 Btu. Adding these together, we get the total heat lost by the system, which is also the heat lost by the surroundings, so T_s = 102 °F. We can then use the fact that Q = mc\Delta T to calculate the final temperature of the system: 6 lbm * 1 Btu/lbm-°F * \Delta T = -144 Btu + 48 Btu, so \Delta T = -56 °F. Adding this to the initial temperature of the ice (32 °F), we get a final temperature of 46 °F.

The mass is given by the volume of the cylinder times the density of the wood, which is 2/3 that of water. The volume of water displaced is that of the submerged part of the cylinder, which has a height equal to its diameter and a radius equal to half the diameter of the cylinder. The weight of the displaced water is therefore given by (\pi/6) d^3 \cdot g, where d is the diameter of the cylinder. Equating the two weights and solving for d gives d = sqrt(2g/9g_0), or d = sqrt(2/9) \approx 0.58 times the radius. The diameter-to-length ratio is therefore 1.16, or (G).

 Efficiency is given by the ratio of output power to input power. We know the output power is 69W, so we need to calculate the input power.

For the open circuit test, input power is VI_2/2 = 230 * 0.62 / 2 = 69/2 W.
For the short circuit test, input power is V_2 I / 2 = 2300 * 4.9 / 2 = 527.5 W.
For the ohmic resistance test, input power is V_2 I_2 / R = 2300 * 4.35 / 10.9 = 980.7 W.

So the total input power is 69/2 + 527.5 + 980.7 = 1177.45 W. Efficiency at rated kVA is then 69 / 1177.45 * 100% = 5.88% or approximately 94.1%.

For the second part of the question, we need to calculate the apparent power, which is

 We are asked to find the depth at which the temperature does not fall below freezing. We can assume that the earth is acting as a heat sink at a constant temperature of 5C, and that heat is diffusing from it into the pipe. We can model this as a one-dimensional heat equation with a constant heat source at the bottom, and zero heat flux at the top. The solution to this equation is given by q = \frac{k \alpha}{2 \sqrt{\pi t}}e^{-\alpha^2/4t}, where q is the temperature at time t and depth \alpha, and k is the thermal conductivity. We can set this equal to the freezing temperature of 0C, and solve for \alpha to find the depth at which the temperature just reaches freezing. We have that 0 = \frac{k \alpha}{2 \sqrt{\pi t}}e^{-\alpha^2/4t}, or \alpha = 2 \sqrt{\pi t} * 0. We can plug in t = 48 hours = 2 * 3600 s, and find that \alpha = 1.4 m. We must also account for the fact that the earth itself has

 We first simplify the transfer function to get F(s) = (s + 7)/(s^2 + 6s + 13). We can then find the zeros and poles of the system. The zero is at -7, and the poles are at -1 ± 3i. We can then use the impulse response formula, which is given by the Cauchy distribution, to find the time domain representation: f(t) = e^{-7t} \operatorname{Re}\left\{e^{(-1+3i)t}u(t)\right\}. Evaluating this gives us f(t) = e^{-7t}\left(\frac{e^{-t}\cos(3t-26.6^\circ)}{\sqrt{2}}\right)u(t), or f(t) = [e^{-7t}e^{-t}\cos(3t-26.6^\circ)]/\sqrt{2}u(t), which simplifies to the answer (A).

 We first factor the denominator: (s + 1)^2 (s + 3) = (s + 1) * s * (s + 3) = s^2 + 3s + 3s + 1 = s^2 + 4s + 3. We can now see that the partial fraction expansion has two terms with a linear denominator and one with a constant denominator. Dividing the original expression by the factored denominator, we obtain 1 / {(s^2 + 4s + 3) (s + 3)} = (A / s^2) + (B / (s + 1)) + (C / (s + 3)). We solve for the coefficients by plugging in the values s = -3, s = -1 and s = infinity. This gives us the system of equations 3A + B - C = 1, -A + B = 0, and C = 1, which has the solution A = 1 / 4, B = 1 / 2 and C = 1 / 3.

Next, we can calculate the velocity of the fluid, using the volumetric flow rate and the cross-sectional area of the tube: v = \frac{\dot{V}}{A} = 1.25 ft/s. Now we can compute the Nusselt number, using the correlation Nu = 0.023 Re Pr^{1/3}, where Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu} and Pr = \frac{C_p \mu}{k} = 10.4. This gives us Nu = 10.

 We know that the torque is conserved in the system, so that N_1 \omega_1 = N_2 \omega_2, where N is the number of teeth and \omega is the angular velocity. We also know that the power is conserved, so that P_1 = P_2, which means that (\omega_1/2\pi)(T_1/60) = (\omega_2/2\pi)(T_2/60), where T is the torque. Combining these two equations, we get that T_1/N_1 = T_2/N_2, which means that the driving torque is 3/2 times the driven torque. We also know that T = 2\pi N \sin(\phi) \tau, where \tau is the chain tension and \phi is the angle of contact. We can assume that the angle of contact is the same for both sprockets, and that the tension is the same for a given chain. We thus have that T_1/T_2 = N_2/N_1 = 3/2, which means that the driven sprocket requires a chain with twice the breaking strength of the driving sprocket

 We first find the temperature distribution. The rate of heat transfer from the walls is given by q_w = 2 \pi rh_x (T_w - T_x), where r is the radius, h_x is the local heat transfer coefficient, T_w is the wall temperature and T_x is the fluid temperature at radius r. Integrating this equation over the pipe radius, and noting that the heat transfer rate is constant per unit area, we obtain q_w \pi R^2 = 2 \pi R h_x \int_0^R (T_w - T_x) r dr. The left hand side is just the total heat transfer rate, which we know is q_w \pi R^2, so we obtain the integral equation 1 = 2Rh_x \int_0^R T_x r dr. We can evaluate this integral in terms of T_b1, the known bulk mean temperature at x=0, to obtain T_x = T_b1 - (1/(2R))x.

We know that w = P ext dV, where P ext is the external pressure and dV is the change in volume. Plugging in the values, we get that \Delta U = 100 Btu - 100 psi * 0.5 ft^3 = 50 Btu.
For the second part, we use the equation of state for a perfect gas, PV = nRT, to solve for the final temperature T. We have that P ext = 100 psi, V = 2 ft^3, R = 8.314 J/(mol K), and from the molar mass of air we have that n = 0.038 kg/mol. This gives us T = 1550 °R, or approximately 1500 °F.

At rated load, P_in = 580 W, P_out = (3/4) * 580 * 0.8 = 435 W, so efficiency is 435/580 = 0.7526 or 75.26%. At half rated load, P_in = 580 W, P_out = (1/2) * 580 * 0.6 = 174 W, so efficiency is 174/580 = 0.3000 or 30.0%. The answers are (B) and (I).

 (i) Breakdown slip is defined as the slip at which the torque reaches a maximum. From the equation for torque T=m(1-s^2)/2s, we can see that this occurs when s=1/\sqrt{2}, or 0.707. Plugging this into the equation for torque, we find that the maximum torque T_max = 0.25m. We are told that the motor stalls at 650 rpm; since the synchronous speed is given by N_s = 120 f, where f is the frequency in Hz, we can calculate that the synchronous speed is 3600/2\pi * 60 Hz = 300 rpm. The slip at stall is therefore 300/650 - 1 = 0.545. The breakdown slip is larger, so we know that the motor is operating beyond its pull-out or stalling region. We can now calculate the locked rotor reactance using the equation X_lr = (R+X_L)/s_b, where R is the rotor resistance and X_L is the leakage reactance. We are told that R=0.3 Ω,

Equating this to Q/2\pi a^3, we solve for h and get h = \frac{Q}{a^3}. We then have the solution inside the sphere as \phi = \frac{Q}{6\epsilon_0} (2a^2 - r^2).

Outside the sphere, Poisson's equation becomes \nabla^2 \phi = 0, with the solution \phi = C_1 + C_2/r. Applying the boundary condition that the potential is zero at infinity, we find that C_2 = 0, and using the condition that the potential is continuous at the surface of the sphere, we find that C_1 = -\frac{Q}{6\epsilon_0}

Multiplying the intensity times the solid angle, we get 71.5 W/m^2. To find the total power absorbed by the body, we need to integrate this over the spectral range given in the question; since half the power is absorbed above and half below the 2.7 \mum threshold, we get a total absorption of 35.75 W/m^2 times the area of the body, which we'll assume to be 1 m^2 for simplicity.

We have that \Delta H = \Delta H_{f,CO_2} - 2 \Delta H_{f,CO} - \Delta H_{f,O_2} = -94,050 - 2(-26,400) - (-32,000) = -39,650 cal/mol. Then, we can calculate the heat released per unit volume of exhaust gas. We have that 1 mole of CO_2 is produced for every 2 moles of CO consumed, and 1 mole of O_2 is consumed as well. So the heat released per unit volume is 39650/(2*0.1 + 0.2 + 0.7) = 132167 cal/ft^3 = 368.15 BTU/ft^3.

This gives us h = 10.8 Btu/(hr ft^2 F).

For the laminar region, we use the formula q = h A \Delta T, where A is the area of the plate and \Delta T is the temperature difference between the surface and the air at the edge of the boundary layer. This gives us q_laminar = 10.8 * 2 * 100 * (500 - 100) = 10800 Btu/hr.

 First, we calculate the change in internal energy of the gas, which is given by \Delta U = C_v (\Delta T), where C_v is the specific heat at constant volume, and \Delta T is the change in temperature. We have that \Delta T = 100 - 40 = 60 F, which corresponds to 33.3 K. Using the ideal gas law, we can calculate the ratio of specific heats, which is 1.4. So C_v = 0.719 kJ/kg K. The change in internal energy is then 22.8 kJ/kg. Using the first law of thermodynamics, we have that \Delta U = Q - W, where Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done by the system. Since no heat is added, Q=0, and the reversible work done is equal to the change in internal energy, which is 22.8 kJ/kg or 5.45 Btu/lbm. The actual work done by the turbine is less than this value, because some energy is lost due to the irreversible nature of the process. To calculate this value, we note

 The expected value of a random variable is given by the integral of r f(r) over the domain of f(r). So we have E[R] = \int_0^\infty rf(r)dr = \int_0^\infty r\left(\frac{r}{\alpha^2}e^{-r^2/(2\alpha^2)}\right)dr = \alpha^2\int_0^\infty ve^{-v^2/2}dv, where we have made the substitution v = r/\alpha. This integral evaluates to \sqrt{\pi}\alpha/2, so E[R] = \sqrt{\pi}\alpha/2. To find E[R^2], we have E[R^2] = \int_0^\infty r^2f(r)dr = \alpha^2\int_0^\infty v^2e^{-v^2/2}dv, which evaluates to \pi\alpha^2/2. The variance is then given by \sigma_r^2 = E[R^2] - E[R]^2 = (\pi - 1)\alpha^2/2.

 First, we calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion reaction: \Delta H = 8 * 42661.1 kcal/mol + 9 * 26218.1 kcal/mol - 27093.8 kcal/mol - 12.5 * 2 * 938.7 kcal/mol - 12.5 * 3.76 * 940 kcal/mol = 199,499.5 kcal/mol. Then, we use the fact that the heat released during the combustion is Q = m LHV, where LHV is the lower heating value of octane, to write \Delta H = m C_p \Delta T, where C_p is the heat capacity of the gas mixture at constant pressure, and \Delta T is the temperature increase. We know that the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure is approximately 29 J/(mol K), so we can write 199499.5 kcal/mol = 0.025 kg * 4184 J/kcal * C_p * 25°

 We can calculate the pressure inside the cylinder using the ideal gas law, pV = nRT, where n is the number of moles, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. We know that the gage pressure is 500 psi, so the absolute pressure is 500 + 14.5 = 514.5 psi. We can rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for T, giving T = (pV)/nR, or 514.5 * 10 / (1 * R) = 5145 / R. R is 198.6 J/(mol K), so T = 26 K. This corresponds to a temperature of 26°F above ambient. Assuming an ambient temperature of 68°F (20°C), the cylinder's maximum temperature is 94°F. The answer is closest to (D).

 The energy emitted by a black body is given by E = A \epsilon \sigma T^4, where A is the area of the body, \epsilon is the emissivity, \sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The emissivity of a grey body is defined as \epsilon = \frac{1}{\pi^4}, so we have E = A \frac{\sigma T^4}{\pi^4}. For a given temperature, the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation is given by \lambda_{peak} = \frac{b}{T}, where b is a constant approximately equal to 2.82 \times 10^{-3} m K. For a 6000°R temperature, this corresponds to a peak wavelength of about 400 nm. We can then approximate the integral over the visible spectrum as the area under a square with side length equal to the width of the visible spectrum, which is 300 nm.

 The differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor is given by L di_L / dt + Rv_C = 0, which we can rewrite as dv_C / dt + (R / L) v_C = -di_L / dt.

The associated homogeneous equation is dv / dt + (R / L) v = 0, whose solutions are of the form e^(-t / (R L)), so we set Y = e^(-t / (2 R L)). Plugging back into the original equation, we get dX / dt + (1 / 2) X = 0, whose solution is X(t) = C_1 e^(1 / 4 t). Plugging this back into our expression for v_C(t), we get v_C(t) = C_1 e^(1 / 4 t) e^(-t / (2 R L)) = C_1 e^(-(3 / 4

 The amount of nitrogen dissolved in the cyclohexane will increase the volume of the liquid by a certain amount, causing it to rise. The amount of rise will be given by the amount of nitrogen dissolved divided by the density of cyclohexane. We can then use the equation for diffusion, which states that the amount of solute diffusing into a solvent is proportional to the concentration gradient and time, to find the diffusivity.

We first find the volume of nitrogen dissolved:
V = \frac{P_2}{P_1} \Delta V = (1 \text{ atm})(0.22 \text{ cm})/(11 \text{ cm}) = 0.02 \text{ L}.

Using the values for air at 70 °F, we find Pr = 0.71. This means that the flow is in the regime where the thermal boundary layer thickness is much smaller than the velocity boundary layer thickness.

For the velocity boundary layer, we can use the solution to the boundary layer equation, which is given approximately by \delta_v = 0.64 x^0.62, where x is the distance from the leading edge of the plate. We can set x = L, the total length of the plate, to find the total velocity boundary layer thickness, which comes out to about 0.015 ft.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on food science for help. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin and is heat-sensitive, so it is easily destroyed by heat. Therefore, the process of canning inherently reduces the vitamin C content of food. Furthermore, vitamin C is easily oxidized when exposed to oxygen and degraded into dehydroascorbic acid, which means that the presence of oxygen causes losses of vitamin C. Therefore, we can eliminate options (C) and (D).

According to the article, vitamin C is very unstable in aqueous solutions and easily destroyed by heat, light and oxygen exposure. Option (A) is incorrect because storing canned food in direct sunlight would accelerate the degradation of vitamin C. Option (B) is also incorrect because nitrogen does not react with vitamin C and has no effect on its preservation. Option (E) is incorrect because preservatives are not effective in preventing losses of vitamin C. Option (F) is incorrect because canned fruits generally have higher vitamin C retention than canned vegetables due to the lower heat exposure required for canning fruits. Option (G) is incorrect because a vacuum is usually applied to the headspace of canned food to remove as much oxygen as possible and limit losses of vitamin C. Finally, option (H) is incorrect because

 The base of the tank has area 116 square feet. Since the tank is a triangular prism, the base is a triangle. Let the sides of the triangle be $a$, $b$ and $c$. Using Heron's formula we obtain that $abc=116\sqrt{3}$. The height of the tank is 30 feet, so the volume of the tank is $\frac{1}{2}bh\cdot 116\sqrt{3}$. We need to find the largest possible volume, so we need to maximize $\frac{1}{2}bh$. Since $a+b+c=30$ and all the sides are positive, without loss of generality we can assume that $a$ is the smallest side. So we have $a+b+30=30$, $b>a$ and we need to maximize $bh$ with respect to $b$. Differentiating $bh$ with respect to $b$ we obtain that the maximum is attained for $h=\frac{30}{2}$.

 Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be two roots of the equation. Then $(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)=0$ is the equation of the line passing through $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We multiply this equation by $x^2$ to eliminate the linear term in the original equation and obtain $(x^2-\alpha x-\beta x)(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)=0$. This equation has all four roots of the original equation as its roots. We also know that the product of all four roots is $(-32)^2=1024$. We equate the two expressions and obtain

 We have to find the area between the parabolas $y = x^2 - 4x + 10$ and $y = 4x - x^2$ on the interval $[1,3]$. We can find this area by calculating the area of the region above the x-axis minus the area of the region below the x-axis.
The vertex of the parabola $y = x^2 - 4x + 10$ is at $(2,8)$, and the vertex of the parabola $y = 4x - x^2$ is at $(1,1)$. The $x$-coordinates of the vertices bound the region we're interested in, so we integrate on the interval $[1,2]$. The area above the $x$-axis is
$$
\int_{1}^{2}\left(x^{2}-4 x+10\right)-\left(4 x-x^{2}\right) d x=\int_{1}^{2} 3 x d x=3\left[\frac{x^{2}}{2}\right]_{1} ^{2}=3 .

 We can represent each path by a string of 10 letters, each of which is either R or U . We can choose the first letter to be either R or U . For any given first letter, there are 9 remaining positions to fill in, each of which has two possible values. So there are $2 \cdot 2^{9}=2^{10}$ paths. However, we have overcounted the paths that touch the line $y=x$ twice: once when the path goes above the line and once when it goes below the line. There are $2^{9}$ such paths, since we can choose the intersection point of the path with the line in 9 ways (the path must go above the line immediately before and after the intersection), and then fill in the remaining 8 positions in the string with two choices each. Subtracting, we find that there are $2^{10}-2^{9}=2^{9}(2-1)=\boxed{25000}$ paths.

We multiply both sides by $dt$ and obtain

We integrate both sides and obtain
\[\int dy = \int \frac{tdt}{2y} + \int \frac{3ydt}{t}.\]
We solve the integrals and obtain

We substitute $t=1$ and obtain $C_2=1$. We substitute the initial condition and obtain $C_1=1/4$. Hence the solution is

The height of the isosceles right triangles is half the distance between the foci, which is $\sqrt{2}$. The width of the triangles is half the length of the minor axis, which is 2 . The volume of $S$ is the area of the base times the height, which is $2\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 \cdot 2=\boxed{16}$.

 We approximate the work by dividing the interval $[0,500]$ into $n$ subintervals of width $\Delta x=500 / n$. We choose $x_{i}=i \Delta x$ for $i=0,1, \ldots, n$. The weight of the cable is approximately constant over each subinterval and equal to $2 x_{i}=2 i \Delta x$. The work done in lifting the cable over the $i$-th subinterval is then approximately $(2 i \Delta x) \Delta x=2 \Delta x^{2} i$. The work done in lifting the coal is approximately constant over each subinterval and equal to $\Delta x \cdot 800$. Hence the total work done is approximately
\begin{aligned}
W & \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[2 \Delta x^{2} i+\Delta x \cdot 800\right] \\

 Work done by a force is given by $W=\int F \mathrm{~d} x$. In this case, the force is constant and equal to $30 \mathrm{~N}$, and the displacement is from $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ to $42 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore,
$$
W=F \Delta x=30 \cdot(12 \mathrm{~cm})=360 \mathrm{~J} .
$$
The given work is twice this amount, or $720 \mathrm{~J}$. We want to find $\Delta x^{\prime}$, the displacement from the natural length of $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ caused by a $30 \mathrm{~N}$ force. Letting $W^{\prime}$ denote the work done in this case, we have $W^{\prime}=F \Delta x^{\prime}=30 \Delta x^{\prime}$. But the work done is also given by the energy stored in the spring, which is half the force times the displacement: $W^{\prime}=\frac{1

 We have

u^{\prime \prime}+\frac{1}{4} u^{\prime}+u=2\left[u_{3 / 2}(t)-u_{5 / 2}(t)\right] .

We can write this equation as
$$
u^{\prime \prime}+u^{\prime} / 4+u / 4=2 u_{3 / 2}(t)-2 u_{5 / 2}(t) .

We know that $u_{3 / 2}(t)=t^{3 / 2}$ and $u_{5 / 2}(t)=\frac{1}{5} t^{5 / 2}$. Hence we have

u^{\prime \prime}+u^{\prime} / 4+u / 4=2 t^{3 / 2}-\frac{2}{5} t^{5 / 2} .

 The potential energy stored in the spring is given by $mgh$ where $h$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The kinetic energy is given by $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Energy is conserved, so we have

 We solve each inequality separately. For the first one we have $y > 9x - 8 \Rightarrow y - 8 > 9x \Rightarrow x < \frac{y - 8}{9}$. For the second one we have $y < -x + 8 \Rightarrow x - 8 < y \Rightarrow x > 8 - y$. We look for the point that does not satisfy both inequalities. We have $x < \frac{y - 8}{9}$ and $x > 8 - y$ which gives us $8 - y < \frac{y - 8}{9}$ or $9y - 72 < y$ or $y < \frac{72}{8} = 9$. The point that does not satisfy this inequality is (E).

Combining the two inequalities we get $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 \leq 9abc$. We also know that $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 =150$. Hence $9abc\geq 150$ and $abc\geq 16\frac{2}{9}$.

 The difference between the water levels at 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. is 12 feet, and the time between these two measurements is 8 hours. Therefore, the average rate of change in the water level over this period is 12 / 8 = 1.5 feet per hour. We seek the rate of change at noon, which is halfway between these two times. Thus, the rate of change at noon is either greater than 1.5 feet per hour or less than 1.5 feet per hour.
The high tide at 8 A.M. corresponds to the maximum of the sine wave describing the water level. Six hours later, at 2 P.M., the water level is at a minimum. Therefore, the wave makes a half period from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. The maximum rate of change of a sine wave occurs at its zeros, which are equidistant from the maximum and minimum. Halfway between 8 A.M. and 2 P.M. is 12:00 noon, and at this time the wave is a quarter period from either the 8 A.M. maximum or the 2 P.

Since $\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $x^2-2$ and $\sqrt{3}$ is a root of $x^2-3$, we have that $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}]=2$ and $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}): \mathbb{Q}]=2$.

 The median is the middle value of the distribution, so it corresponds to the 50th percentile. The first quartile corresponds to the 25th percentile. We know that the distance between the median and the first quartile is a quarter of the total distance between the first and third quartiles, which is the standard deviation multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$. Hence the standard deviation is $\frac{48815-55800}{\sqrt{2}}=\boxed{10476}$.

 There are $20^4$ equally likely outcomes. We count the number of outcomes with exactly two even numbers. We can choose which two dice show even numbers in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. For the two dice that show even numbers, these dice can show any even number from 2 to 20 , which is 9 even numbers. The other two dice can show any number from 1 to 20 , which is 20 possibilities. So the total number of successful outcomes is $6 \cdot 9 \cdot 20^{2}$. The answer is $\frac{6 \cdot 9 \cdot 20^{2}}{20^{4}}=\boxed{\frac{5}{8}}$.

 The Cantor set is constructed by deleting the middle third of the interval $[0,1]$ and then deleting the middle third of each of the remaining intervals, and so on. This process goes on forever, and the Cantor set is the set of points that are left over after all these deletions.
The point $\frac{1}{4}$ survives the first step of the construction, since it's in the left half of the initial interval $[0,1]$. But it's deleted in the second step, since it's in the middle third of the interval $\left[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right]$. So it's not in the Cantor set, and the first entry in our list is 0 .

The area under the parabola and above the x-axis is $\frac{1}{3}(50)^2 \cdot 0.01 = 833.33$.

The probability that a randomly chosen voter is undecided is this number divided by $400 \choose 400$. We have
\begin{align*}
&\frac{\binom{400}{256}+\binom{400}{257}+\cdots+\binom{400}{308}}{\binom{400}{400}}=\frac{1}{400} \sum_{k=256}^{308}

 The number of zeros in the ordinary decimal representation of k! is the number of factors of 2 and 5 in k!. The prime factorization of k! is $k!=2^a\cdot 3^{k-1}\cdot 5^b$ where $a$ is the number of even integers less than or equal to $k$ and $b$ is the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to $k$. We have $a=\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ and $b=\lfloor k/5\rfloor+\lfloor 2k/5\rfloor+\lfloor 3k/5\rfloor$. We want the difference between $a$ and $b$ to be 2. We have $\lfloor k/5\rfloor\leq b\leq a$. So we want $\lfloor k/5\rfloor=a-2$ and $a=b+2$. This gives us the inequalities $k/5\leq\lfloor k/2\rfloor-2$ and $k/2-2\leq\lfloor k/5\rfloor$. These inequalities are satisfied exactly when

 We know that $72=2^3 \cdot 3^2$. We use the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups. First we consider the primary decomposition of $72$. We have two options: either we have two $3$-Sylows and one $2$-Sylow, or one $3$-Sylow and four $2$-Sylows.

Case 1: $72=3^2 \cdot 2^3$. We have two options for the $3$-Sylow: $\mathbb{Z}_{3^2}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_9$. For the $2$-Sylow we have $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_4$. This gives us $2 \cdot 2=4$ options.

Case 2: $72=3^1 \cdot 2^6$. For the $3$-Sylow we have $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and for the $2$-Sylows we have $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times

 Let the numbers on the faces be $a, b, c, d, e, f$. Then the numbers at the vertices are $a b c, a c d, a d b, b c d, c d e, d e f$. Their sum is $1001$ by the statement. We can assume that $a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq e \leq f$. Then $a+b+c+d+e+f \leq 6 f$ and the equality holds when $a=b=c=d=e$. But then the vertex sum is $a b c+a c d+a d b=3 a^{2} d$ which is not divisible by 3 . Hence the actual sum is smaller than $6 f$ and we obtain the inequality $1001=a+b+c+d+e+f \leq 5 f$. The smallest possible $f$ that satisfies this inequality is $f=13$. If we set $a=b=c=d=e=11$ and $f=13$ then the vertex sum is $3 \cdot 11

 We have two even integers, say $2a$ and $2b$. Their product is $(2a)(2b) = 4ab$ and their sum is $(2a) + (2b) = 2(a+b)$. We want to find all possible values of $4ab + 2(a+b)$. We know that $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, so $ab$ is a positive integer. We also know that $a$ and $b$ are even, so $ab$ is even, which means that $ab$ is divisible by 2 . Therefore, $4 a b$ is divisible by 4 . We also know that $a+b$ is even, so $a+b$ is divisible by 2. Therefore, $2(a+b)$ is divisible by 4 . The possible values of $4ab+2(a+b)$ are of the form $4k$ where $k$ ranges over all positive integers. There are infinitely many such $k$ so the answer is not an integer, but rather an interval.

 We have $x^{\prime}=-1.25$ and $y=30$. We seek $y^{\prime}$. We are given a polar coordinate system with origin at the center of the track, so we can use the usual conversion from Cartesian to polar coordinates: $x=r \cos \theta$ and $y=r \sin \theta$. We have $r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$, so $r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. Differentiating both sides, we obtain $r^{\prime}=\left(x^{\prime} y^{\prime}\right) / \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. But $r=50$, so $50\left(x^{\prime} y^{\prime}\right)=r^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$. We also know that $\theta=\arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$, so $\sin \theta=\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}$ and $\cos \theta=\frac{x}{\sqrt

 The characteristic equation is $m^2-2m+2=0$. The roots are $m_1=1+ \sqrt{3}i$ and $m_2=1-\sqrt{3}i$. The general solution is $y(x)=c_1e^{(1+\sqrt{3}i)x}+c_2e^{(1-\sqrt{3}i)x}$.

 We are looking for the most probable sequence of weather given the observed umbrella usage. We will use the Bayes' rule to compute the probabilities of the weather given the umbrella usage.

We start with day 1. We know that P(umbrella) = 1, hence using Bayes' rule we obtain
\[P(\text{rain} \mid \text{umbrella}) = \frac{P(\text{umbrella} \mid \text{rain}) P(\text{rain})}{P(\text{umbrella})} = \frac{0.6 \cdot 0.6}{1} = 0.36.\]
Similarly $P(\text{sunny} \mid \text{umbrella}) = 0.4 \cdot 0.4 = 0.16$.

For day 2 we have
\[P(\text{rain} \mid \text{no umbrella}) = \frac{P(\text{no umbrella} \mid \text{rain}) P(\text{rain})}{P(\text{no umbrella})} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.6}{1 - 0.36} = 0.5.\]

 We can rewrite the equation as $e^{-x}=1-x$. For small $x$ we have $e^{-x} \approx 1-x+\frac{x^{2}}{2}$, so we can approximate the equation by

Solving this equation we get $x_{1}=0$ and $x_{2}=\frac{1}{2}$. We choose $x_{2}$ because the solution we seek is positive. Now we apply Regula-Falsi method. We have

 We have to distribute 10 balls among 4 boxes in such a way that each box has at least one ball. We can think of this problem as first distributing 9 balls into 4 boxes and then placing the last ball into one of the four boxes. The number of ways to distribute 9 balls is the same as the number of ways to place 3 indistinguishable balls into 4 boxes, which is $\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{4}{2}=96$. The last ball can be placed in 4 ways. So the answer is $96 \times 4=\boxed{384}$.

 The Binormal vector is defined as $\mathbf{B}=\mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N}$, where $\mathbf{T}$ is the Tangent and $\mathbf{N}$ is the Normal vector. First we find $\mathbf{T}$.
$$
\mathbf{r}^{\prime}(t)=6 i+10 t j-8 k .

Hence $\mathbf{T}=6\left(\hat{\mathbf{i}}+\hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)$. Now we find $\mathbf{N}$.

\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime}(t)=10 i-8 j .

 We will show that $n=15$ is the smallest possible. First, we show that $n=14$ is not possible. Suppose that we have colored the edges of $K_{14}$ in such a way that there is no 4-clique in red or blue. We will show that this coloring can be extended to $K_{15}$. Consider a vertex $v$ and its 14 neighbors. Since there is no 4-clique in red or blue in $K_{14}$, at most 6 of the 14 neighbors of $v$ are connected to each other by red edges, and at most 6 are connected by blue edges. We color the edge between $v$ and the new vertex with the same color that connects the two sets of 6 vertices. This coloring extends the coloring of $K_{14}$ to $K_{15}$.
Now we show that $n=15$ is possible. We color the edges of $K_{15}$ as follows. Partition the vertex set into three sets $A, B$ and $C$ of size 5. Color all edges within $A$ and $B$ red, and

 We have to choose 3 numbers from 10 to indicate the sizes of the subsets. The first subset can be chosen in $\binom{10}{1}$ ways, the second one in $\binom{9}{1}$ ways and the third one in $\binom{8}{1}$ ways. After that we have to multiply by $3!$ to account for the order in which we have chosen the sizes. Finally we multiply by the number of ways to arrange 10 people in a line, which is $10!$. The answer is $\binom{10}{1}\binom{9}{1}\binom{8}{1} \cdot 3! \cdot 10! = \boxed{8430}$.

 Green's Theorem states that

where $C$ is the boundary of the region $R$. We have $P=xy$ and $Q=x^{2} y^{3}$. Then $\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}=y, \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=x, \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}=3 x^{2} y^{2}, \frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}=2 x^{2} y^{3}$. The region $R$ is the triangle with vertices $(0,0),(1,0),(1,2)$. We take the $x$-coordinate to be the same as the $y$-coordinate, so the region is the triangle under the parabola $y=x$ between $x=0$ and $x=1$ and above the $x$-axis. Its area is $\int_{0}^{1}(x)^{2} d x=\frac{

 The Birge-Vieta method states that the sum of the roots of $x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots+a_0=0$ is $-a_{n-1} / a_0$ and the product is $(-1)^n / a_0$. We have
\[x^5-x+1=0 \Longrightarrow -1=\frac{1}{a_0}\left(x+\frac{1}{x^4}\right).\]
Hence the sum of the roots is $-1$ and the product of the roots is $(-1)^5=1$. The sum of the roots is also equal to the opposite of the coefficient at $x^1$ divided by the constant term, hence $-1=-\frac{1}{1}$. We conclude that the roots are $\boxed{-1}$ and $\boxed{1}$. The first one is repeated four times, hence the real root we seek is $\boxed{-1}$.

The graph has 16 vertices and no red triangles and no blue 6-cliques. Now, suppose that we have a coloring without red triangles and without blue 6-cliques. Consider the number of edges colored red incident to a given vertex $v$. This number is even, because each edge is incident to two vertices. If this number is $\leq 4$, then the neighborhood of $v$ contains no red edges, a contradiction. If this number is 6 , then the 6 neighbors of $v$ induce a red 6-cycle, and the edges between them form a red triangle, a contradiction. If this number is 8, then the 8 neighbors of $v$ induce two disjoint red 4-cycles, and the edges between them form a red triangle, a contradiction. If this number is $\geq 10$, then the neighborhood of $v$ contains a blue 6-clique, a contradiction. Hence the number of red edges incident to $v$ is either 5 or 7 . But then the neighborhood of $v$ contains a red triangle, a contradiction. The answer

 We know that $Y_7$ is the seventh largest number among the eight observations. We also know that the 70th percentile is the smallest number such that at least 70% of the observations are smaller than it. Hence at most 3 out of 8 observations can be larger than $27.3$. This means that the probability that $Y_7$ is larger than $27.3$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{8}$. The probability that $Y_7$ is smaller than $27.3$ is then $1-\frac{1}{8}=\boxed{0.875}$.

 Statement 1 is false. Consider $f(x) = x$ and $g(x) = 1$. Then $\deg(f(x) + g(x)) = 1$ but $\max(\deg f(x), \deg g(x)) = 1$.
Statement 2 is true. Let $I$ be an ideal of $F[x]$. Then $I$ is generated by some polynomial $f(x)$. If $\deg f(x) = 0$ then $f(x) = r$ for some $r \in F$ and $I = rF[x]$. Otherwise, let $a$ be the coefficient of the leading term of $f(x)$. Then $a$ is a unit in $F[x]$ and $f(x) = a \cdot \frac{f(x)}{a}$. Hence $I = aJ$ for $J = \{\frac{f(x)}{a} \mid f(x) \in I\}$.

 The equation of the tangent line to the graph of $r=f(\theta)$ at an angle $\theta$ is given by $y=f(\theta)+f^{\prime}(\theta)(y-\theta)$. Setting the $x$ coordinate equal to the $y$ coordinate, we obtain $\tan \theta=f^{\prime}(\theta)$. For $r=\sin 3 \theta$, we have $f(\theta)=\sin 3 \theta$ and $f^{\prime}(\theta)=3 \cos 3 \theta$. Setting $\tan \theta=3 \cos 3 \theta$, we obtain $\sin 3 \theta=3 \cos ^{2} \theta$. We can factor the left side as $\sin 3 \theta=3 \sin \theta \cos 2 \theta$, and then divide both sides by $\cos 2 \theta$ to obtain $\sin \theta=\frac{3}{2} \cos \theta$. We can then solve this equation for $\theta$ using the usual methods for solving trigonometric equations. One solution is $\theta=\frac{3 \pi}{4}$, or $\boxed{5 \pi / 12}$.

 We know that $N$ ends in $abcd$ and $N^2$ ends in the same digits. We also know that $N^2$ equals $(10^x-abcd) \cdot 10^x$ for some positive integer $x$. We also know that the last four digits of $N^2$ are $abcdabcd$. We can find $x$ by dividing $(10^x-abcd) \cdot 10^x$ by 100 and taking the remainder. We get that $10^x-abcd$ is divisible by 100. The only such number is 200 and hence $x=2$. We also know that the hundreds digit of $N^2$ is 1 . Hence the hundreds digit of $N$ is 1 or 2 . If it's 2 then $N$ ends in 200abcd and $N^2$ ends in 4abcdabcd which is not the same ending. Hence the hundreds digit of $N$ is 1 and the tens digit is not 0 or 5 because then the units digit of $N^2$ would be 0 . Hence the tens digit is

 We divide the rectangle into two rectangles of width 1.25 and height 2 and two rectangles of width 1.25 and height 1 . The first two rectangles are shown on the picture below. Their areas are $(1+3 / 4) \cdot 2=11 / 4$ and $(2+3 / 4) \cdot 1=5 / 4$. Their product is $(11 / 4)(x_{1}+2) \cdot(5 / 4)(y_{1}+1)=(11 / 4)(5 / 4)(x_{1}+2)(y_{1}+1)$. The second two rectangles are similar and their product is $(11 / 4)(x_{2}+1)(y_{2}+2)$. Adding these four together we obtain the answer $\boxed{3.75}$.

 We can use cylindrical coordinates. The region in the first octant is bounded by $\rho = 1 / \sqrt{2}$, $z = 2 \rho^2$ and $\rho = 1 - \varphi$. The integral over $\varphi$ goes from 0 to $\pi / 4$.

 We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms, given that it's under 194 ohms. To do this, we first find the probability that a resistor has a resistance between 188 and 194 ohms, which is the probability that a normally distributed random variable is between $\mu-1.28 \sigma$ and $\mu-0.5 \sigma$, or $P\left(188 \leq X \leq 194\right)=P\left(-1.28 \leq\left(X-200\right) / 5 \leq-0.5\right)=P\left(-0.258 \leq Y \leq-0.5\right),$ where $Y$ is standard normally distributed. Evaluating the above probability using a normal distribution table or software gives approximately 0.1246. Now we find the probability that a resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms. This is $P(X>188)=1-P(X \leq 188)=1-P\

 We have $(x-p)(x-q)=(r-p)(r-q)$, which we can rewrite as
\[x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq.\]
We can easily see that $r$ is a root of this quadratic equation, and the other root is given by the formula
\[\frac{-(p+q) \pm \sqrt{(p+q)^2 - 4pq - 4r^2}}{2}.\]
We know that the expression under the square root sign is a perfect square, because the given equation is equivalent to $(x-r)^2 = (p-r)(q-r)$. Hence we can take the square root and conclude that the other solution is
\[\frac{-(p+q) - \sqrt{(p-r)(q-r)}}{2} = \boxed{r-p-q}.\]

 We have 366 possible birthdays and we have 1000 people. We can assign each person to one of the birthdays. There are $366^{1000}$ ways to do this. But we also have to account for the possibility that some people have different birthdays. The number of ways to assign birthdays to the people so that everyone has a different birthday is $366 \cdot 365 \cdot 364 \cdots 357$. The ratio of these two numbers is
\[\frac{366^{1000}}{366 \cdot 365 \cdot 364 \cdots 357}=\frac{366^{999}}{365 \cdot 364 \cdots 356}=\frac{366}{365}\cdots \frac{366}{357} \approx 0.407 .\]

Case 1: $N_2(1) = 0$. In this case, we immediately have $N_1(1) = 1$, and the probability of this happening is $\frac{e^{-1} 1}{e^{-1} 1}=1$.
Case 2: $N_2(1) = 1$. Then the probability that this happens is $\frac{e^{-2} 2}{e^{-1} 1}=\frac{2}{e}$. Given that this is the case, the probability that $N_1(1) = 1$ is $\frac{e^{-1} 1}{e^{-2} 2}=\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the contribution to our final answer from this case is $\frac{2}{e}

 We have the equation
$$
u^{\prime \prime}+2 / 5 u^{\prime}+7 / 5 u=0 .

The characteristic equation is $m^2+2/5m+7/5=0$. The roots are $m_{1,2}=-1/5\pm\sqrt{11}/5$. The general solution is
$$
u(t)=c_{1} e^{-t / 5} \cos \left(\sqrt{11} t / 5\right)+c_{2} e^{-t / 5} \sin \left(\sqrt{11} t / 5\right) .

Using the initial conditions we find $c_1=1$ and $c_2=2/(\sqrt{11}+1)$. Hence

 We solve the homogeneous equation first. The characteristic equation is $m+\frac{2}{3}=0$, so the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $y_{h}(t)=c e^{-\frac{3}{2} t}$. Now we look for a particular solution of the form $y_{p}(t)=A t+B$. Substituting into the equation we obtain
$$
A+B+\frac{2}{3}\left(A t+B\right)=1-\frac{1}{2} t .
$$
This gives $A=1 / 3$ and $B=-1 / 2$. Hence the general solution is
$$
y(t)=c e^{-\frac{3}{2} t}+\frac{1}{3} t-\frac{1}{2} .
$$
For $t=0$ we have $y(0)=c-\frac{1}{2}=y_0$. The solution touches the $t$-axis when $y(t)=0$. This happens when $c=\frac{1}{2}$. Hence $y_0=\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}$.

 We need to find all $c$ such that the polynomial $x^3 + cx^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_3$. We know that $x^3 + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_3$ because it has no roots in $\mathbb{Z}_3$. Assume that $x^3 + cx^2 + 1$ factors over $\mathbb{Z}_3$. Then there exist $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}_3[x]$ such that $x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = (x - a)(x^2 + bx + c_1)$ for some $a, b, c_1 \in \mathbb{Z}_3$. Expanding the right hand side we obtain
\[x^3 + (c - a)x^2 + (ab - c_1)x + ac_1 - c.\]
Comparing the coefficients we obtain $c_1 = 1$ and $c - a = 0$. Hence $c = a$. Further expanding gives us

 We are testing $H_0: \mu = 3.5$ against $H_a: \mu > 3.5$. We have significant results at a 5% level of significance, hence we can reject $H_0$. This means that the sample mean is greater than 3.5. If we construct a 95% confidence interval, it will be an interval $(a, b)$ such that $\mu \in (a, b)$ and $a > 3.5$. Hence the statement (H) is true.

 Let $X$ denote the weight of a randomly chosen truck. We are given that $\Pr(X>12000)=0.7$ and $\Pr(X>10000)=0.8$. Then $\Pr(X \leq 10000)=1-\Pr(X>10000)=0.2$ and $\Pr(10000<X \leq 12000)=0.7-0.2=0.5$.
Hence the probability that $X$ is between 10000 and 12000 is 0.5. The mean is at least 11000 and the standard deviation is at most 1000 because the mean and median are both in this interval.
We also know that $\Pr(X>14000)=\Pr(X>12000)-\Pr(X>10000)=0.3$. Hence the probability that $X$ is between 12000 and 14000 is 0.3. The mean is at most 13000

 Let $g(x) = f(x-2)$, then $g(10) = f(8)$. Stretching vertically by a factor of 2 means that the new function $h$ satisfies $h(x) = 2 \cdot g(x)$. Hence $h(10) = 2 \cdot g(10) = 2 \cdot f(8)$. Knowing that $f(0) = 0.1$ we get that $h(0) = 2 \cdot f(0) = 0.2$. The graph of $h$ passes through the points $(0,0.2)$ and $(10,2 \cdot f(8))$. The line passing through these two points has the equation $y = mx + 0.2$ for some $m$. But the graph of $h$ is above this line, hence the slope $m$ must be greater than 1 . The only such pair $(x,y)$ for the line with this property is $(8,2)$, hence $h(10) = 2$. The original function $f$ satisfies $f(10) = h

We also have $\angle Y = \angle RST - \angle RTS = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - \angle RTS$. Hence $\angle RTS = 90^\circ - \angle Y = 90^\circ - (180^\circ - 90^\circ - \angle RTS)$, so $2 \angle RTS = 180^\circ$ and $\angle RTS = 90^\circ$.

The first condition means that the coordinates of $\mathbf{x}$ are orthogonal to the coordinates of any vector from the subspace. We can write any vector from the subspace as a linear combination of the basis vectors: $\alpha \cdot[2, 2, 1, 0]+\beta \cdot[-2, 2, 0, 1]$. Hence the coordinates of $\mathbf{x}$ are orthogonal to $2 \alpha-2 \beta,2 \beta$ and $\beta, 0$ respectively. This gives us $\alpha x_{1}-\beta x_{1}=0, \alpha x_{2}+\beta x_{2}=0$ and $x_{3}=0$.

\[W\left(y_1, y_2\right)(4)=y_1(4) y_2^{\prime}(4)-y_1^{\prime}(4) y_2(4)\]
and we need to find $y_1(4)$ and $y_2(4)$. We have that $y_1$ and $y_2$ satisfy the equation
\[t^2 y^{\prime \prime}-2 y^{\prime}+(3+t) y=0.\]
Multiplying both sides by $t$ we obtain

Let $z=t y$. Then $z^{\prime}=t y^{\prime}+y$ and $z^{\prime \prime}=t y^{\prime \prime}+2 y^

A $\Rightarrow$ B: If the column vectors of M form a basis, then any two of them are linearly independent.
B $\Rightarrow$ C: If any two distinct columns are linearly independent, then the determinant of the 2 x 2 submatrix formed by these two columns is nonzero, which implies that the trace of M is nonzero.
C $\Rightarrow$ D: If the trace is nonzero, then the characteristic polynomial has a nonzero constant term, which means that the constant term of the quadratic equation obtained by setting the characteristic polynomial equal to zero is nonzero, which means that the roots are nonzero.
D $\Rightarrow$ E: If all eigenvalues are nonzero, then the kernel consists only of the zero vector.
E $\Rightarrow$ F: If the homogeneous system has only the trivial solution, then the determinant of the augmented matrix is nonzero, which implies that the determinant of M itself is nonzero.

 We first calculate the probability that we get exactly 2 sixes. There are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the positions for the two sixes and for each choice the probability of success is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{3}=\frac{25}{7776}$. We then calculate the probability that we get one six: there are 5 ways to choose the position for the six and the probability of success is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{1}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{4}=\frac{5}{7776}$. Adding up the two cases we obtain $\frac{25+25}{7776}=\boxed{\frac{50}{648}}$.

 The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence is $\frac{n(a_1+a_n)}{2}$. We have $a_1=1$ and $a_n$ is the sum of all previous terms, i.e. $a_n=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i$. Hence
\begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i &= \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{i(1+a_{n-1})}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(1+a_{n-1})}{4} \\

We want this to be consistent for some $x$ and $y$ not both zero, so we require that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ are both zero, giving $a=2 M_{11}$ and $c=2 M_{12}$. Similarly, we require $b=3 M_{21}$ and $d=3 M_{22}$. We also know that the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $(\lambda-2)(\lambda-3)=0$, so the eigenvalues are 2 and 3 . Hence the trace and determinant of $A$ are 5 and 6 respectively.

For the third subset we have 2 elements left and we can choose 1 of them in 2 ways. For the fourth subset we have 1 element left and we can choose it in 1 way. Finally, the fifth subset contains the remaining element. The total number of ways is $56 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 1008$. We multiply this number by 5! to account for the order of subsets and obtain $\boxed{11760}$ ways.

But then for all $x \in [0,1]$ we have $|p_n(x) - p_m(x)| < \epsilon$ and since this holds for all $x$ we have $\|p_n - p_m\|_{\infty} < \epsilon$.

 The average weight is 248 pounds, so the expected value of the weight of one player is 248 pounds. The expected value of the sum of four independent random variables, each having the same expected value, is four times the expected value of one of them. So the expected value of W is indeed 992 pounds.
The standard deviation of the sum of four independent random variables equals the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard deviations of the random variables. The standard deviation of the weight of one player is 47 pounds, so the standard deviation of W is $\sqrt{4}(47)=\boxed{75}$ pounds.

 We integrate the area of the region between the two curves over the x-axis to obtain the volume of the solid of revolution. We have
\[V = \int_0^{\ln 2} 2\pi y(e^x) dx = 2\pi \int_1^2 y e^x dx.\]
We change the order of integration and obtain
\[V = 2\pi \int_0^{\ln 2} x e^x dx - 2\pi \int_0^{\ln 2} e^x dx.\]
The first integral is easy to evaluate:
\[2\pi \left[\int_0^{\ln 2} x e^x dx = \left[e^x x - e^x\right]_0^{\ln 2} = 2e^{\ln 2} - 2 = 4 - 2\right].\]

 First we choose 3 elements to be in the first subset. This can be done in $\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways. For each such choice we have two choices for the element that goes into the second subset. This gives us $10 \cdot 2=20$ possibilities. But we have overcounted the case when all elements go into the first subset and none goes into the second one. Subtracting this case we obtain $\boxed{20-1=19}$ possibilities.

 The product of the roots is equal to the coefficient at the x^0 term, hence klmn = 1. On the other hand, the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient at the x^1 term divided by 3 , hence kl+lm+mn+nk = 9/3 = 3. We have two equations and four unknowns, but we can easily solve this system. Adding the equations we obtain that (k+l+m+n)^2 = kl+lm+mn+nk and since the left hand side is symmetric in k,l,m,n we obtain that kl+lm+mn+nk = (k+l)(m+n). Hence klmn = (k+l)(m+n). We know that kl = mn, so $(k+l)(m+n) = 2kl$. Hence $klmn = kl \cdot \frac{k+l}{2}$. But we know that klmn = 1, so $\frac{k+l}{2}=1$ and $k+l=2$. Similarly we obtain that $m+n=2$.

 Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the two roots that sum to 5 . Then the third root is $- \alpha-\beta$. We are given that $\alpha+\beta=5$ and $\alpha \beta=-15$. Multiplying these two equations together gives $\alpha^{2} \beta^{2}=-15 \cdot 5=-75$. Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are real, both must have the same sign, so either $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both positive or both negative. Without loss of generality assume $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive. Then $\alpha^{2}=r$ and $\beta^{2}=s$ for some positive reals $r$ and $s$ with $r s=75$. The product of the three roots is $(-\alpha-\beta) \alpha \beta=-15$, so the sum of the three roots is $(-\alpha-\beta)+\alpha+\beta=0$. Hence the middle root, which is the negative of the sum of the other two, is 0 . Therefore $\alpha+\beta=-\alpha-\beta=0$, which means $\alpha=\beta=5 / 2

 We can divide the polygon into triangles by connecting vertices in such a way that no two lines intersect if and only if we connect vertices in such a way that no two lines are parallel. We can connect vertices in a cyclic manner, and we can also connect vertices in such a way that we go back and forth between the two ends of the polygon.
For the cyclic connections, we have 8 choices for the first vertex we connect, 7 for the second, 6 for the third, and so on down to 1 choice for the last vertex. The number of such connections is $8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2=2016$.
For the back-and-forth connections, we have 4 choices for the first pair of vertices we connect, 3 for the second, 2 for the third, and 1 for the last. The number of such connections is $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1=24$.
The total number of ways is $2016+24=\boxed{2040}$.

 The monthly payment is $P=\$ 800$. The interest rate is $r=9 \%$ or $r=0.09$ as a decimal. The term of the mortgage is $T=20$ years or $T=20 \cdot 12=240$ months. We seek to find $I$, the total interest paid. From the formula for the continuous compounding, we have that $P=\$ 800$ is related to the total amount borrowed, $A$, by the equation $A=P /(1-r / n)$ where $n$ is the number of compounding periods per year. Hence $A=800 /(1-0.09 / 12)=800 / 0.91= \$ 879.13$. The total amount owed at the end of the mortgage is then $A V=A+I=\$ 1600$.

 The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The value of the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1 . A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, and a correlation of -1 a perfect negative relationship. The sign of the correlation coefficient tells us the direction of the relationship, and the magnitude tells us the strength of the relationship. The correlation coefficient does not imply causation. The statement (A) is incorrect.
The statement (B) is incorrect.
The statement (C) is incorrect.
The correlation coefficient applies to quantitative data only. The statement (D) is incorrect.
The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line are not the same thing. The statement (E) is incorrect.
The correlation coefficient and the slope of the regression line can have different signs. For example, if the regression line has a negative slope and the correlation coefficient is positive, then the points are scattered around the regression line in such a way that the line fits the data poorly. The statement (F) is correct.
The statement (G) is correct. Both correlations indicate a very strong linear relationship.

 The probability of being in a corner room is $\frac{1}{8}$. The probability of being in a middle room is $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability of leaving a corner room is $\frac{1}{3}$. The probability of leaving a middle room is $\frac{2}{3}$. The entropy rate is the weighted average of the entropy of leaving a corner room and the entropy of leaving a middle room. The entropy of leaving a corner room is $\frac{1}{2} \log _{2} 3$ since there are three equally likely exits. The entropy of leaving a middle room is $\log _{2} 3$ since there are three equally likely exits. The entropy rate is then $\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \log _{2} 3+\frac{1}{6} \cdot \log _{2} 3=\boxed{\frac{11}{24}}$.

 We have $2x^2 + 15x + 16 = 0 \Rightarrow 2(x + 8)x = -16 \Rightarrow x + 8 = \frac{-16}{2x}$. We can rewrite this equation as $x + \frac{4}{x} = -8$. We know that product of the roots is equal to the right hand side of the equation divided by the coefficient at $x^1$, hence $mn = -\frac{16}{2} = -8$. We also know that the sum of the roots is opposite of the coefficient at $x^1$, hence $m + n = -15$. We can solve this system of equations using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& x+\frac{4}{x}=-8 \\
& x^{2}-8 x+4=0
\end{aligned}
$$
The roots are $\frac{4 \pm \sqrt{12}}{2}$. We can easily check that $\frac{4-\sqrt{12}}{2}$ is the smaller root, hence $m = \frac{4-\sqrt

 We can think of the process as a random walk on the integers, starting at 0 and taking steps of size $\pm 1$. The walk ends when it reaches -1 or 1 . The probability of ending at 1 is the probability that an odd number of steps are taken, which is $\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of ending at -1 is the probability that an even number of steps are taken, which is also $\frac{1}{2}$.
The expected number of white squares remaining is the expected number of steps taken before the walk ends, which is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot$ expected number of steps in an absorbing random walk that ends at 1 plus $\frac{1}{2} \cdot$ expected number of steps in an absorbing random walk that ends at -1 . The expected number of steps in either of these random walks is 1 + expected number of steps in a random walk that starts at 0 and is absorbed at 1 , which is just the expected number of steps in a simple symmetric random walk. This latter quantity is well-known to be $\frac{1}{2} \ln 2$. Therefore, the expected number of white squares remaining is $\ln

We also know that $\mu^{\circ}=E^{\circ}-\frac{RT}{nF} \ln K$, so we can solve for $K$ and get $K=e^{\frac{nF \mu^{\circ}}{RT}}=e^{4.15} \approx 86$.

 In a forced harmonic oscillator, the energy is continually being added by the external force, so the total energy is not conserved. However, the energy is still shared between the kinetic and potential energy, and the ratio of the two stays constant. Thus the ratio of the rms values of the potential and kinetic energy, which is $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ and $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ should be constant. This means that $\frac{k x_{rms}^2}{m v_{rms}^2} = 1$. We also know that in a harmonic oscillator, $v_{max} = \omega x_{max}$. Combining these two equations, we get $x_{rms} = \frac{x_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and $v_{rms} = \frac{\omega x_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}$. Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, and the equation of motion is $x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$, we can find the maximum acceleration to be $\omega^2 x_{max}$. Taking the time average, we get $a_{rms} = \frac{\omega

We can solve for the final temperature using the ideal gas law and the fact that $\gamma = 1 + 1/C_v$ to get $T_f = T_i\left(\frac{P_f}{P_i}\right)^{C_v/(C_v+1)}$.

 The weight of the earth's mass inside a spherical shell of radius $r$ is given by the product of the mass and gravitational acceleration, which is in turn proportional to $r$. Equating this to the force due to gravity $GMm/r$ gives us $Mr^2 \propto r$, or $r \propto M^{1/2}$. We can solve for the proportionality constant, which is $G$. The earth's mass is given by its density times volume, which is $(5.5\times 10^3\,{\rm kg/m^3})\times (4\pi/3)(6.4\times 10^6\,{\rm m})^3 = 1.04\times 10^{14}\,{\rm kg}$.

 The force of friction is given by $F = \mu mg$, where $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction, $m$ is the mass, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. So the force of friction is $0.005 \times 200\,\text{tons} \times 32\,\text{ft/s}^2 = 320\,\text{lbs}$. The power output of the engine is force times velocity, so the maximum velocity is $320\,\text{lbs} / 400\,\text{hp} = 0.8\,\text{lbs/hp}$. The weight of the cars is $200\,\text{tons} \times 32\,\text{ft/lbs/ton} = 6400\,\text{lbs}$, so the acceleration is $0.8\,\text{lbs/hp} / 6400\,\text{lbs} = 0.000125\,\text{hp}^{-1}$.

We can rearrange this to solve for the mass $m = q / (2.816 \text{C/kg}) = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} / 2.816 \times 10^{-3} \text{kg} = 5.68 \times 10^{-17} \text{kg}$. The answer is closest to (A).

Then, we know that the pressure of the gas after expansion is 1 atmosphere, and the temperature is increased to $T'=50^\circ\text{C}+273.15=323.15\text{ K}$. We also know that the amount of gas $n$ is conserved, so we can set the $n$ and $R$ in the two equations equal to each other, giving us \begin{align*}
1.37\times10^6\text{ Pa}\times2\text{ ft}^3&=n\times300\text{ K}\\
1\text{ atm}\times V&=n\times323.15\text{ K}

 The energy of a photon is given by $E = hc/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. We are given the wavelength $\lambda = 3900\AA = 390\times 10^{-10}m$. Substituting into the equation, we get $E = (6.626\times 10^{-34}Js)(3\times 10^8m/s)/(390\times 10^{-10}m) = 5.15\times 10^{-19}J = 5.15eV$. The work function $\phi$ is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface, so the maximum energy of the emitted electrons is $\phi$. If light with wavelength 3900\AA doesn't cause emission, then $\phi$ must be greater than $5.15eV$. The closest choice is (E).

 The wave nature of electrons is most clearly shown in their discrete orbits around the nucleus, so we seek a wave-based model. Particles on springs and particles on strings are both mechanical models that don't involve waves, and have nothing to do with the nucleus either. Energy fields and high-speed particles are too vague to be useful. Photons and protons are the wrong type of particles. That leaves us with (D) and (H). Of these two, only (D) explicitly mentions waves and particles together, so the answer is wave-particles.

 First, we find the escape velocity at the surface of the earth, which is $\sqrt{2 G m_E/R_E} = 11.2 \text{ km/s}$. Then we find the velocity needed at 300 km altitude, which is a bit lower due to the reduced gravity there. We can approximate this by assuming the satellite is just falling from rest at 300 km with no air resistance -- in that case, it would fall back down to the 300 km altitude in a time of $2R_E/v_{esc}$, and thus its velocity there would be $v_{esc}\sqrt{2\cdot 300\text{ km}/R_E} = 7.8 \text{ km/s}$. The change in gravitational potential energy from the earth's surface to 300 km altitude is then $m g \Delta h = 1000\cdot 9.8\cdot 300000\text{ J} = 2.94\times 10^{10}\text{ J}$. However, we also need to supply the satellite with lateral kinetic energy

 The volume change of the glass flask is given by $\alpha V_0 \Delta T$, where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion, $V_0$ is the initial volume, and $\Delta T$ is the temperature change. Since the flask is filled to the brim, the amount of mercury that overflows is equal to this volume change. We have $\alpha = 0.4 \times 10^{-5}$, $V_0 = 200 cm^3$, and $\Delta T = 80 K$. Thus the answer is $\alpha V_0 \Delta T = 0.4 \times 10^{-5} \times 200 \times 80 = \boxed{0.32 cm^3}$.

 The energy difference between the valence and conduction bands needs to be converted into a photon's energy. The energy difference is given by the equation $E = \frac{1}{2} mV^2$, where $m$ is the effective mass of the electron and $V$ is the potential difference between the bands, which is about 1 eV for germanium. The photon energy is given by $E = hf$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $f$ is frequency. We can set these two equations equal to each other and solve for frequency, then convert frequency to wavelength using the speed of light. The effective mass of electrons in germanium is about 0.014 times the mass of a free electron, and the potential difference between the bands is about 0.8 eV, so the energy is $3\times 10^{-4}$ eV. The Planck constant is $6.6\times 10^{-34}$ J s. Solving for frequency gives a value of $2.7\times 10^{15}$ Hz. The speed of light is $3\times 10^8$ m/s, so the wavelength is $1.1

 First, we should draw a free-body diagram for the ladder. There's gravity pulling the ladder down, and the normal force from the wall pushing it up. Since the ladder is in equilibrium, these two forces must balance each other. We can write $mg\sin\theta = N$, where $N$ is the normal force and $m$ is the mass of the ladder. We also know that the force balancing the weight of Lancelot is given by $N\cos\theta$. Setting these two equal, we get $N(\cos\theta-\sin\theta)=\frac{800}{3}g$. Solving for $N$, we get $N=1200\sin\theta\cos\theta=\boxed{1200\sqrt{2}\sin(2\theta)}$.

 We can treat the car as a mass on a spring, where the spring is the suspension of the car. The spring constant is related to how much the car compresses with load; in this case, for every 100kg, the car compresses 1cm.

The amplitude of the driving force is given by half the settling amount per wavelength, or $0.5\mathrm{cm}/(20\mathrm{cm}) = 0.025\mathrm{m}$. Using the equation for forced oscillation, $x = \frac{F_0}{m\omega_0^2 - \omega^2} \sin(\omega t)$, we can solve for the amplitude, where $\omega_0$ is the undamped angular frequency and $\omega$ is the driving frequency.

Now we compute the curl: $\nabla \times \mathbf{A}=\hat{\mathbf{k}}$.

 We know that the electric field is given by $\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}V$, where $V$ is the electric potential. The electric potential satisfies Laplace's equation $\nabla^2 V = 0$ because of the spherical symmetry, and the solution to Laplace's equation with the given boundary condition is $V = K' r^5/r_0^4$ for some constant $K'$. Thus the electric field is $\vec{E} = 5 K' r^4/r_0^4 \hat{r}$, and comparing with the given expression for $\vec{E}$, we see that $K'=K/r_0$. Gauss's law then gives us $\int E \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}$, or $4\pi r^2 E = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}$, which gives us $Q_{\text{enc}} = 4 K \varepsilon_0 r^4$.

 The electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$.

 Water has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each hydrogen atom has one proton, and the oxygen atom has eight protons, so a molecule of water has 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 protons, or positive charges.

 The number of fringes is given by $\Delta x / \lambda$, where $\Delta x$ is the displacement and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the laser light. In this case, the wavelength of the helium-neon laser is 633 nm.
For (a), $\Delta x$ is directly towards or away from the viewer, and thus in the direction the fringes are being counted. So the number of fringes is $\frac{2500\,\mathrm{nm}}{633\,\mathrm{nm}} = 3.95$, or 3.9 fringes to the nearest whole number.
For (b), $\Delta x$ makes a 45 degree angle with the direction the fringes are being counted, so only the component of $\Delta x$ in the correct direction matters. The component is half of the full displacement, so the number of fringes is $\frac{1250\,\mathrm{nm}}{633\,\mathrm{nm}} = 1.98$, or 1 fringe to the nearest whole number.
For (c), $\Delta x$ is in the plane of the surface, and thus perpendicular to the direction fringes are being counted

A reasonable number for the efficiency of the braking system might be 50%, so the answer is 490,000 J, or (C).

 When the spheres are connected by a wire, charge will flow along the wire until both spheres have the same charge. Since the electrostatic force between them is zero in this state, the initial electrostatic force must have been due to the charge on a single sphere. This charge, when doubled, will give us the answer. The initial force is $0.108 \mathrm{~N}$, and the final repulsive force is $1/4$ of this, or $0.027 \mathrm{~N}$. Doubling the charge will thus give us $0.054 \mathrm{~C}$. Since we are looking for the negative charge on one sphere, the answer is twice this, or $\boxed{-0.108 \mu \mathrm{C}}$.

 The heat evolved in the reaction is given by $mc\Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the water in the inner bath, $c$ is the specific heat capacity of water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. We are also told that the heat evolved in the reaction is equal to the heat absorbed by the calorimeter and its contents, so this expression is also equal to the calorimeter constant times $\Delta T$. Setting these two equations equal to each other and solving for the calorimeter constant gives us $\text{Calorimeter constant} = \frac{mc\Delta T}{\Delta T} = mc\cdot 2.76 \mathrm{~K} = (1.55 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~g})(4.18 \mathrm{~J/(g} \cdot \mathrm{K)})\cdot 2.76 \mathrm{~K} = \boxed{10120 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{K}}$.

 The gravitational redshift is given by $\Delta\lambda/\lambda = GM/Rc^2$, where $R$ is the radius of the sun and $M$ is the mass of the sun. We can use the fact that the sun's radius is 700,000 km and its mass is $2\times 10^{30}$ kg. Plugging in, we get $\Delta\lambda/\lambda = 6.9\times 10^{-6}$, or a change in wavelength of $6.9\times 10^{-5}$ relative to the wavelength observed in deep space. Since the sun's light has a wavelength of about 500 nm, this corresponds to a frequency shift of $6.9\times 10^{-5}\times 5\times 10^{14} \text{Hz} = 3.45\times 10^{9}\text{Hz}$. The energy difference between the two frequencies is then $h\times 3.45\times 10^{9}\text{Hz} = 2.4\times 10^{-2} \text{eV}$.

 The ideal gas law is $PV=nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles of the gas. We can rearrange this to solve for $n$: $n = PV/RT$. The molar mass of helium is 4 gm/mol, so the mass of helium is given by $n$ times the molar mass. We have $P=100\times 10^5 Pa$, $V=50 L$, $R=0.0821\ L\cdot atm/(mol\cdot K)$, and $T=15+273.15 K$. Putting these together, we get $n = 100\times 10^5\ Pa\cdot 50\ L / (0.0821\ L\cdot atm/(mol\cdot K)\cdot 288.15 K) = 1.79\times 10^3\ mol$.

 First, we should find the relativistic gamma factor $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$. Plugging in the speed, we get $\gamma = 4$. The relativistic energy is then given by $E = \gamma mc^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $c$ the speed of light. We know that the non-relativistic energy is given by $E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, so equating the two gives us $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \gamma mc^2$. Solving for $v$ and plugging in the speed, we get $E = \frac{9}{8}mc^2$. Now we can solve for the potential difference using the equation $E = qV$. Knowing that the charge of an electron is $-e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, we get $-\frac{9}{8}mc^2 = -eV$. Solving for $V$, we get $\boxed{1125\,\mathrm{V}}$.

 The angular size $\theta$ of an object is related to the separation of the mirrors $d$ and the wavelength $\lambda$ by $\theta = \lambda/d$. We know that for a separation of 3m, the visibility goes to zero at some wavelength in the middle of the visible spectrum, say 550 nm. So $\theta = 550\times 10^{-9}\text{m}/3\text{m} = 0.0183\text{rad}$. Since 1 radian is 57.3 degrees, and there are 3600 seconds of arc in a degree, the answer is $0.0183\times 3600\text{arcsec} = \boxed{0.066\text{arcsec}}$.

 Venus is very similar to Earth in size and mass, but has a thick, toxic atmosphere.

This suggests that the surface of Venus is quite old, on the order of billions of years. We know the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old; let's pick (I).

Putting these together, we find $R=2 v_{0 x} h / v_{0 y}$. The height can be found from the equation for the range of a projectile, $h=\left(v_{0}^{2} / 2 g\right)\left(1-\sin ^{2} \theta\right)$. Putting these together, we find $R=\frac{v_{0}^{2} \sin 2 \theta}{g}$. Now we can find the horizontal miss distance: it's just half of the horizontal range, or $\frac{v_{0}^{2} \sin 2 \theta}{2 g}$.

We can thus write down the equation for the pressure P as a function of the initial volume V_0 and the bulk modulus K: P = P_0 - K(V - V_0), where P_0 is the initial pressure, 1 atm in our case. Solving for the new volume V, we get V = V_0 + (P_0 / K)(1 - P/P_0)V_0. Plugging in the numbers, we get the new volume is 2.3875 liters, or a decrease of 0.1125 liters. The energy stored in the material is the negative of the pressure times the change in volume, or 68 erg/cm^3. The answers are (A) and (F).

 First, we compare the electrostatic and gravitational forces. The electrostatic force between the electron and the proton is given by $k \frac{q_e q_p}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{r^2}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The gravitational force is given by $G\frac{m_e m_p}{r^2}$. Using the values given in the question, we find that the electrostatic force is about $10^{41}$ times larger than the gravitational force, so we can safely neglect gravity.

Next, we can find the centripetal acceleration of the electron, which is given by $\frac{v^2}{r}$. Using the relationship between force and acceleration, we can solve for the centripetal force, which is the electrostatic force we calculated earlier, to find the centripetal acceleration $a = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 m_e r^2}$. We can then solve for the speed $v = \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4\

 The vanderWaals' equation is given by $(P+\frac{a}{V^2})(V-b)=RT$, where $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the temperature. We can rearrange this equation to obtain $V=\frac{b}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4}+\frac{a}{P}RT}$. For a single mole of helium at STP, $P=1\text{ atm}$, $T=273\text{ K}$, and $R=0.0821\text{ L atm}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-1} \text{ mole}^{-1}$. Substituting these values and the given value of $b$ into the equation, we obtain $V\approx 26.7\text{ L}$. Since there are 3 moles of gas in 1 liter at STP, the molar volume is about 8.9 L/mole. Using the ideal gas law $PV=nRT$ and solving for $r$, the radius of the helium molecule is about 0.445 Å. Twice this value gives the diameter, or about 0.8

 We can break the horizontal and vertical components of the ball's velocity. The horizontal component will stay constant, and the vertical component will accelerate towards the ground. We can find the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground by setting the initial vertical position equal to half the distance fallen under gravity, $1/2 g t^2 = 8m$, which gives $t = 2\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~s}$. During this time, the ball travels $v_x \times t = 10\sin20^\circ\times2\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~m} = \boxed{9.2 \mathrm{~m}}$.

We need to find the angle of incidence that makes the angle of refraction as small as possible. Since the prism is at a larger angle, light will always be deflected towards the normal, so the angle of incidence should be as small as possible. This happens when the angle of incidence is 0°, which makes the angle of refraction also 0°. The answer is then 0°.

 First, we find the tension T in the chain. Since the chain is not accelerating horizontally, the tension times the radius of the spool must equal the mass times the acceleration down the plane, or $T\cdot r = mg\sin\theta$. We also know that the force of tension must equal the weight of the chain from the spool to the height y, or $T = mg_y$. Combining these, we find $r\cdot mg\sin\theta = mg_y$, and thus $r = y$. Knowing that the chain is not accelerating horizontally, we can write down the equation $T - mg_y = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, which we can solve for $v^2$ to obtain the answer (C).

 The escape velocity from Mars depends on the mass enclosed within a sphere centered at the launch point, which is the mass of Mars times the ratio of the radius of the orbit to the radius of Mars. This ratio is $(22,000\ \text{km}+3400\ \text{km})/3400\ \text{km} = 7$. The escape velocity from the surface of Mars is $\sqrt{2GM/R} = 8.2\ \text{km/s}$, so the escape velocity from 22,000 km above the surface is $8.2\ \text{km/s}\sqrt{7} = 11.4\ \text{km/s}$. The missile must travel this velocity upwards to reach the spaceship, but the spaceship is also moving horizontally at the Mars's equatorial velocity of $7.4\ \text{km/s}$.

 The period of a mass-spring system is given by $T = 2\pi\sqrt{m/k}$, where $m$ is the mass and $k$ is the spring constant. We are told that the period is 2 seconds, so $k = (2\pi s)^{-2} \cdot m$. The acceleration due to gravity $g$ is related to the weight $mg$ of the mass, so a change in $g$ changes the period by an amount $\Delta T = 2\pi\sqrt{(\frac{\Delta g}{g})m/k}$. We can solve for $\Delta g/g$ and get $\Delta g/g = (\Delta T/T)^2$. Plugging in the numbers, we get $\Delta g/g = (0.1 s/2 s)^2 = 0.01$. Since $g$ is 9.8 m/s^2 on Earth, the answer is 9.8 × 0.01 m/s^2, or (A).

First, note that the brass rod has a smaller coefficient of expansion and a smaller Young's modulus than steel, so it will contribute less to the stress. Next, note that the brass rod has half the length of the steel rod, so its contribution to the stress is only 1/2 that of the steel rod. Thus the stress in the entire system is dominated by the steel rod. The steel rod expands by $\Delta L = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \times 50 \text{ cm} \times 40^\circ \text{C} = 0.006$ cm.

 Young's modulus is defined as the ratio of stress and strain, or $\sigma/\epsilon$. In this case, we have the Young's modulus and the strain, so we can solve for the stress $\sigma$. Since the stress is defined as force per area, we can solve for the force.

The strain is defined as $\Delta L/L_0$, so the change in length is 0.2% of the original length, or 0.002 times the original length. Young's modulus is given in dynes/cm^2, but the area is in sq cm, so we need to convert the units on Young's modulus to match the area: $19\times 10^{11}\text{ dynes/cm}^2 = 19\times 10^3\text{ dynes/\AA}^2$.

 First, we calculate the mass defect: 6.01692 + 1.00813 - (4.00386 + 2* 2.0141) = 0.01603 amu. This is the energy released in the reaction, which is 3.945 MeV. To convert to amu, we divide by the conversion factor, 931.5 MeV/amu, to obtain 0.00172 amu. Adding this to the mass of the heavier isotope gives us the mass of the lighter isotope: 4.00386 + 0.00172 = 4.00558 amu, or (D).

 The number of protons that decay per unit time is proportional to the total number of protons, $N$, in the body, so the number of decays per day is $N\cdot\text{decay rate}$. We are given that half the body mass is protons, so the mass of protons is 31 kg. The number of protons in 1 atomic mass unit is Avogadro's number, so the total number of protons is $31\ \text{kg}\times\frac{1\ \text{mol}}{1.66\times 10^{-24}\ \text{kg}}\times 6.02\times 10^{23}\approx 1.1\times 10^{27}$. The decay rate is half-life times the fraction that decay in one half-life, or $1/(2\times 10^{33})$. Multiplying these together gives us the answer of $\boxed{2.2\times 10^{-9}\ \text{decays/day}}$.

 The acceleration of the train is given by the change in velocity over the change in time. We can find the initial acceleration by taking the velocity change from 0 to 5 mph over the time change of 5 minutes; the final acceleration can be found by taking the velocity change from 5 mph to 7 mph over the time change of 5 minutes. Since the mass of the train should not affect the acceleration, the initial and final accelerations should be the same. We can then use Newton's second law to solve for the force provided by the engine, which is equal to the mass times the acceleration. Then we can solve for the added mass by adding this quantity to the initial mass of the train.

The index of refraction for a rectangular waveguide is given approximately by $n = 1.59/\sqrt{1-(0.66a/w)^2}$, where $w$ is the width of the waveguide. We want to solve for $a$ given that the speed of light is reduced to 95% and 50% of its free-space value, or $v/c = 0.95$ and $v/c = 0.5$.
For 95% of the speed of light, $1.59/\sqrt{1-(0.66a/w)^2} = 0.95$, or $a/w = 0.49$. This means $a = 0.49w$. Solving for part (a) gives us $a = 3.5$ cm.
For 50% of the speed of light, $1.59/\sqrt{1-(0.66a/w)^2} = 0.5$, or $

 First, we can calculate the kinetic energy of the a-particles by dividing the given energy by the rest mass energy of the particle, which is $E_k = E / (2m_0 c^2) = 6.048 MeV / (2 * 938 MeV/c^2) = 1.56 \times 10^-11 J$. We can then use the kinetic energy formula $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ to solve for the velocity, which comes out to be $1.709 \times 10^7$ m/s. To find the magnetic field, we can use the equation for centripetal acceleration $a = \frac{v^2}{r}$, or $v^2 = r \cdot a$. The magnetic force provides the centripetal force $F_B = qvB = m_0 \cdot a$, so we have $B = \frac{v}{q r}$. Plugging in the numbers, we get $B = \frac{(1.709 \times 10^7 m/s)^2}{2 \times (6.

 We can solve this problem using kinematic equations. Let the initial velocity be 0, and the acceleration of the front motorcycle be $a_1$ and the acceleration of the back motorcycle be $a_2$. We first find the time it takes for the two motorcycles to meet using the equation $s=v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$. Setting the distance traveled by the two motorcycles equal to one another, we get $\frac{24.5}{2}=t(a_2-a_1)$, which gives us $t=\frac{24.5}{a_2-a_1}$. Now we can plug this back into the equation above to solve for the velocity at the time of meeting: $24.5=\frac{a_1}{2}(t)^2+a_1t$, which gives us $v_1=\frac{49}{2t}$. Doing the same for the back motorcycle, we get $v_2=\frac{74}{t}$. Now we can plug in the value of $t$ we found earlier to get $v_1=22\frac{1}{2}$ ft/sec and $

 The magnetic force on the proton is given by $q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$, and since this force is perpendicular to both $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{B}$, it provides a centripetal force for the circular motion of the proton. Thus the magnitude of the magnetic force is equal to $mv^2/r$, and we can solve for the period of the circular motion $T=2\pi r/v$. Using the given initial speed and the fact that the side length of the triangle formed by the initial velocity vector, the direction of the magnetic field, and the displacement after 4 seconds is $4\sqrt{3}$ times the radius of the circular path, we can find that the period is 8 seconds and thus the circumferential distance traveled in 4 seconds is $4\times\pi r$. Using the initial speed and this circumferential distance, we can solve for the new speed, which is $\boxed{2.25\times 10^6\,\text{m/s}}$.

For the net force to be 0 N, the electrostatic and gravitational forces must balance each other out. This can happen when the charges have the same sign (repulsion balances gravity) or opposite signs (attraction balances gravity). Thus, we see that the particles do not need to have the same mass or the same charge (as long as the product of charges and the ratio of masses are the same), so (C) and (I) are not necessarily true.

The shape factor is then given by \sigma = 1/f_1 + 1/f_2 = 1/0.1875 + 1/(-0.375) = 1/3. The position factor for an object 1.2 m away is given by \pi = 1 - d/f, where d is the distance of the object from the lens; equating this to the above value of 1/3 gives d = 2/9 m = 0.222 m, which is indeed 1.2 m.

 The bright spot appears when the movable screen is at a distance of $2R$ from the aperture, and the dark spot appears when the screen is at a distance of $R$ from the aperture. We have $\sin(\theta) = \frac{m}{f}$, where $m$ is the order of the spot and $f$ is the distance from the aperture. Setting $2f$ equal to $2R$ for the bright spot and $f$ equal to $R$ for the dark spot, we can solve for the wavelength of the light. For the bright spot, $m=2$ and $f=2R=1.8\text{ cm}$, so the wavelength is $\lambda = \frac{2R}{2} = 900\mu\text{m} = 0.9\times 10^{-6}\text{m}$.

 First, we calculate the actual vapor pressure at 15C: 12.8 mm Hg / 100 = 0.128 g/L. Then we know that at 10C, the vapor pressure is 9.2 mm Hg / 100 = 0.092 g/L. The ratio of these two pressures is the relative humidity, or about 72.5%. To find the mass of the moist air, we use the ideal gas law, assuming that the volume of air is constant at 1 liter: $PV = nRT$ implies that $n = PV/RT$. The number of moles of air is the mass divided by the molar mass of air, and the number of moles of water vapor is the mass of water divided by the molar mass of water. Then the total pressure P is the sum of the partial pressures of dry air and water vapor. Putting everything together, we get:
\begin{align*}
P &= (1 - x) \frac{PV}{RT} + x \frac{PV}{RT} \\

 The amount of heat generated in the coil is given by the electrical power times the time, which is $(110\,{\rm V})(2\,{\rm A})(1.25\,{\rm min}) = 300\,{\rm J}$.

 The relative intensities of the secondary maxima are given by $(\sin(\frac{m\lambda}{a}))^2$, where $m$ is the order of the maximum and $a$ is the width of the slit. We can assume $\lambda$ to be the same for all orders, so the ratio of intensities is simply $\frac{\sin^2(\frac{m_1\lambda}{a})}{\sin^2(\frac{m_2\lambda}{a})}$. Taking the ratio of the first and second order intensities, we get $\frac{\sin^2(\frac{\lambda}{a})}{\sin^2(\frac{2\lambda}{a})}$. Setting $\lambda/a$ to be $\alpha$, this becomes $\frac{\sin^2\alpha}{\sin^2(2\alpha)}$. Using the double-angle formula $\sin(2\alpha) = 2\sin\alpha\cos\alpha$, this evaluates to $4\sin^2\alpha\cos^2\alpha/\sin^2(2\alpha) = 4\cos^2\alpha$.

 The wave travels back and forth across the 200 m valley in 10 s, so the speed of the wave is 200 m / 10 s = 20 m/s. We know that the tension force in the wire must be equal to the mass of the wire times the acceleration of the wave, so we have $T = m \cdot a$. We can find the acceleration from the wave speed by taking the inverse of the speed divided by the length: $a = \frac{1}{T} \cdot \frac{L}{v} = \frac{1}{20 \text{ m/s}} \cdot \frac{200 \text{ m}}{10 \text{ s}} = 10 \text{ m/s}^2$.

 We can solve this problem using energy conservation. At the highest point of the trajectory, all the initial potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy, so $1/2 m v^2 = m g h$, where $h$ is the maximum height. We can solve for the velocity $v = \sqrt{2 g h}$. The horizontal displacement is given by $d = v t$, and the time in the air is given by $t = 2 h / g$. Combining the two equations, we get $d = \sqrt{2 h^2 g}$. Now we can equate this to the maximum height to solve for the angle: $\tan \theta = \sqrt{2}$, which is (E).

 The work done against friction is given by the integral of force over distance, which in this case is the product of the coefficient of friction and the applied normal force integrated over the distance. The applied normal force is the weight of the bicycle and rider, which we'll call $W$. Thus the work done is $μW\cdot d$, and the change in kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, which equals $μWd$ by conservation of energy. Setting the initial speed $v$ and distance $d$ known, we can solve for $μW$. For the first tire, $v=3.5\ \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ and $d=18.1\ \text{m}$, and thus $μW=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3.5\cdot 9.8\cdot 18.1 = 260.09\ \frac{\text{N}\cdot\text{m}}{\text{kg}}$.

We know the initial resistance and the final resistance, and the triple point of water is defined to be 273.16 K, so we can solve for the temperature increase $\Delta T$ and add it to the triple-point temperature to find the final temperature.

The temperature coefficient of platinum is 0.00392 K$^{-1}$; thus $\Delta R/R = 0.00392 \Delta T$, or $\Delta R = 0.00392 R \Delta T$. We can solve for $\Delta T$ by plugging in the known values: $12.40 \Omega - 9.20 \Omega = 0.00392 \cdot 9.20 \Omega \cdot \Delta T$, so $\Delta T = 32 \text{ K}$.

The time the ball is in the air can be found from the vertical motion; setting the initial velocity equal to the final velocity of 0, we get that the time is v_y / a = 565.7 m/s / (-9.8 m/s^2) = 57.8 s.

 The probability of a neutron being absorbed is 1 - e^(-\tau\sigma), where $\tau$ is the thickness of the material divided by the mean free path and $\sigma$ is the cross section. The mean free path is 1/(n\sigma), where n is the number density of nuclei. For a given volume, the number density is the mass divided by the molar mass times Avogadro's number times the volume, so n = 18 g/(100 g/mol) * 6.02 * 10^23 / (3.2 cm)^3 = 1.7 * 10^24 m^-3. The cross section is given as 0.68 barn, which we have to convert to m^2: 0.68 * 10^-24 m^2. Now we can compute the probability: 1 - e^(-(1.7 * 10^24 m^-3 * 3.2 m) * 0.68 * 10^-24 m^2) = 1 - e^(-1.12) = 0.44.

 The period of a simple pendulum is given by $T=2\pi\sqrt{l}$, where $l$ is the length of the pendulum. When the support is accelerating upward, the effective length of the pendulum changes because the point of attachment is moving. The displacement of the pendulum bob from the attachment point also changes because of the acceleration. To find the effective length, we note that the acceleration felt by the bob is the vector sum of the acceleration of the support and the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the effective length of the pendulum is given by $l_{\text{eff}}=l+v_{\text{bob}}t+ \frac{1}{2}at^2$, where $v_{\text{bob}}$ is the velocity of the bob. Setting the velocity to zero and solving for the period when the acceleration of the support is upward gives $\boxed{2\pi\sqrt{\frac{b}{a}}}$.

 a) The powers simply add up: 5 + 8 = 13 diopters. b) The reciprocal of the power gives the focal length, so 1/13 = 0.077 cm, or 7.7 cm. c) The principal plane of a thin lens is half-way between the lens and its focal point. The first lens's focal plane is thus at 6.25 mm, and the second at 3.75 mm from the respective lenses. The principal points are thus 3.125 mm apart. d) The focal points are at the focal length minus the principal plane: the posterior focal point of the second lens is thus 4.75 mm from the lens, and the anterior focal point of the first lens is 11.25 mm from the lens. e) To find the image distance, we use the lens equation 1/f = 1/v + 1/u, where u is the object distance and v is the image distance. Starting from the first lens, we find that the image is formed 16 cm away, which is beyond the second lens. This image is real and inverted, and acts as an object for

a) The Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that the net rate of heat loss is proportional to the difference in temperature between the two plates, $\Delta T = 100 K$. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant is $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} W/m^2 K^4$. So the net rate of heat loss is $2\sigma A \Delta T = 5.67 \times 10^{-6} \times 2 \times (100 K) = 1.13 \times 10^{-4} W/m^2$.
b) Energy balance on the foil tells us that the energy absorbed from the warmer plate must equal the energy radiated from both sides of the foil. The area of the foil is half that of the plates since the foil has the same footprint as the plates, so the temperature of the foil is found to be $T = \frac{200 + 300}{4} = 250 K$.
c) Now that the foil radiates energy, the net rate of heat loss from the warmer plate is reduced by the amount radiated onto the

 Skewness is the measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. We can calculate the skewness coefficient by using the formula: g1 = E((X - μ)^3) / σ^3, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation. The data given is 3, 2, 3.7, 5, 2.7 and 3. The mean is (3 + 2 + 3.7 + 5 + 2.7 + 3)/6 = 3.833, the standard deviation is sqrt((3 - 3.833)^2 + (2 - 3.833)^2 + ... + (3 - 3.833)^2) = 0.934. The third central moment is E((X - μ)^3) = (3.7 - 3.833)^3 + ... + (2 - 3.833)^3 = -0.041. The skewness coefficient g1 = -0.041 / 0.934^3 ≈ -0.011. The

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Self-serving bias refers to the tendency to take more credit for success than failure. Social comparison theory refers to the tendency to evaluate one's opinions and abilities by comparing oneself with others. Fundamental attribution bias refers to the tendency to overestimate the importance of personal characteristics and underestimate the role of situational factors when explaining the behavior of others. Actor-observer bias refers to the tendency to attribute one's own behavior to situational factors, but others' behavior to their disposition. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to view past events as being more predictable than they actually were. Overjustification hypothesis refers to the tendency that extrinsic rewards reduce intrinsic motivation. None of them fits the description. Self-perception theory refers to the tendency to infer one's own characteristics and dispositions based on observing one's own behavior. However, the question describes the employee expects greater consistency in the boss's behavior, which is about the boss, not the employee himself. The remaining two theories are about cognitive dissonance and self-verification. Self-verification theory refers to the tendency to seek feedback and information that confirms one's self-concept. The employee expects greater consistency in the boss's behavior, which implies the employee sees the boss's behavior as inconsistent, thus
