 Cell motility is the ability of a cell to move spontaneously. It is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of many proteins and other molecules. The actin cytoskeleton is the main structural component of the cell, and it is responsible for generating the force that drives cell movement. The actin cytoskeleton is composed of actin filaments, which are dynamic structures that can polymerize and depolymerize in response to external stimuli. The actin cytoskeleton is organized into three main structures: the lamellipodia, the filopodia, and the stress fibers. The lamellipodia are broad, flat structures that extend from the leading edge of the cell. They are composed of actin filaments that are oriented parallel to the cell membrane. The filopodia are thin, finger-like structures that extend from the leading edge of the cell. They are composed of actin filaments that are oriented perpendicular to the cell membrane. The stress fibers are thick, contractile structures that extend from the cell body to the cell membrane. They are composed of actin filaments that are oriented parallel to the cell membrane. The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a number of proteins, including myosin, act

 Molluscs are a diverse group of animals that have evolved a variety of feeding mechanisms to adapt to different lifestyles. The feeding mechanisms of molluscs can be broadly classified into three categories: filter feeding, suction feeding, and predation.

Filter feeding is the most common feeding mechanism among molluscs. Bivalves, such as clams and oysters, are filter feeders that use their gills to filter food particles from the water. They have a specialized organ called the ctenidia, which is made up of thin, hair-like structures called cilia. The cilia create a current that draws water into the gills, where the food particles are trapped and then moved to the mouth for digestion.

Suction feeding is another common feeding mechanism among molluscs. Cephalopods, such as squid and octopus, are active predators that use their tentacles to capture prey. They have specialized suckers on their tentacles that allow them to grip and hold onto their prey. Once the prey is captured, the cephalopod uses its beak to tear it apart and then uses its radula, a tongue-like structure, to grind the food into smaller pieces.

 Morphogenesis is the process by which an organism develops its shape. It is generally believed that morphogenesis is controlled by the expression of genes, which is regulated by transcription factors. The expression of genes is also regulated by inductive effects, which are signals that are transmitted from one cell to another. The expression of genes is also regulated by signal transduction, which is the process by which a signal is transmitted from one cell to another. The expression of genes is also regulated by cell migration, which is the process by which a cell moves from one place to another. The expression of genes is also regulated by cell differentiation, which is the process by which a cell becomes specialized.

 The lac operon is a group of genes that are responsible for the metabolism of lactose in E. coli. The operon consists of three structural genes (lacZ, lacY, and lacA), which encode the enzymes necessary for lactose metabolism, and a regulatory gene (lacI), which encodes a repressor protein that binds to the operator region of the operon and prevents transcription. The lac operon is regulated by the presence of lactose in the environment. When lactose is present, it binds to the repressor protein, causing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator region. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the structural genes, leading to the production of the enzymes necessary for lactose metabolism. In the absence of lactose, the repressor protein binds to the operator region, preventing transcription and thus preventing the production of the enzymes necessary for lactose metabolism. In (a), the partial diploid has a wild-type allele at the i, o, and a loci, and a mutant allele at the z and y loci. Since the mutant allele at the z and y loci is recessive to the wild

where $k$ is the number of categories, $observed_i$ is the observed frequency in the $i$th category, and $expected_i$ is the expected frequency in the $i$th category.

In this case, we have two categories: yellow and green. The expected frequencies are 6022 and 2001, respectively. The observed frequencies are also 6022 and 2001. Therefore, the chi-square statistic is:

$X^2 = (6022 - 6022)^2 / 6022 + (2001 - 2001)^2 / 2001 = 0$

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on economics for help. The profit function is given by:

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Total Revenue = Price * Quantity = 20 * q
Total Cost = 0.1q^2 + 10q + 50

Substitute the profit function into the profit equation:

Profit = 20q - (0.1q^2 + 10q + 50)

Simplify the profit equation:

Profit = 20q - 0.1q^2 - 10q - 50
Profit = -0.1q^2 + 10q - 50

To find the maximum daily profit, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:

Cost = 10x

Profit = 90x - 0.02x^2 - 10x = 80x - 0.02x^2

To maximize the profit, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of the profit function with respect to x and setting it equal to zero:

 The pH of a weak acid is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. $$pH = pK_a + log_{10}
frac{[A]}{[HA]}$$. Here, $[A]$ is the concentration of the conjugate base, and $[HA]$ is the concentration of the acid. We are given the concentration of the acid, and we need to find the concentration of the conjugate base. We can do this by using the equilibrium expression for the ionization of the acid. $$K_a = 
frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $[A^-]$. $$[A^-] = K_a
frac{[HA]}{[H^+]}$$. We can substitute this into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. $$pH = pK_a + log_{10}
frac{[HA]}{[HA] 
frac{K_a}{[H^+]}}$$. We can simplify this to $$pH = pK_a + log_{10}
frac{K_a}{[H^+]}$$. We can then solve for the pH. $$pH = 4.

 The mass absorption coefficient is defined as the ratio of the mass attenuation coefficient to the density of the material. The mass attenuation coefficient is defined as the ratio of the percent decrease in intensity to the thickness of the material. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to the product of the mass absorption coefficient and the density of the material. The percent decrease in intensity at a depth of 1.5 cm is therefore equal to $9.80 \times 10^3 \times 12 = 117600$. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to $117600 \div 150 = 784$. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to $784 \div 1000 = 0.784$. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to $0.784 \div 100 = 0.0784$. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to $0.0784 \div 100 = 0.00784$. The percent decrease in intensity is therefore equal to $0.00784 \div 100

 The first thing we need to do is determine the amount of ^40K in the sample. We know that the percent abundance of ^40K is 0.0118, and that the sample contains 3 percent K by weight. Therefore, the amount of ^40K in the sample is 0.0118 × 0.03 = 0.000354 mol. We also know that the ^40Ar / ^36Ar ratio is 75,200. This means that for every 75,200 atoms of ^40Ar, there are 1 atom of ^36Ar. We can use this information to determine the amount of ^40Ar in the sample. We know that there is 95.0 × 10^-7 (m^3 of / kg sample)^40Ar at STP, and that the ^40Ar / ^36Ar ratio is 75,200.

 The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a particle between collisions. The mean free path is given by the formula $l = \frac{1}{n \sigma}$, where $n$ is the number of particles per unit volume and $\sigma$ is the collision diameter. The number of particles per unit volume is given by $n = \frac{N}{V}$, where $N$ is the number of particles and $V$ is the volume. In this case, $N = 1$ and $V = 100$ liters. Therefore, $n = \frac{1}{100}$. The collision diameter is given as 2.0\AA, which is equal to $2 \times 10^{-10}$ meters.

 The reaction we are interested in is $C(graphite) + 2H_2(g) = CH_4(g)$. We can use the other reactions to find the heat of formation of CH4. We start by rewriting the first reaction as $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) = CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(1)$. We then subtract the second reaction from the first, which gives us $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) - C(graphite) - C_2 (g) = CO_2 (g) - C(graphite) - C_2 (g)$. We then cancel out the $C(graphite)$ and $C_2 (g)$ terms, which gives us $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) = CO_2 (g)$. We then subtract the third reaction from the second, which gives us $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) - H_2(g) - (1/2) O_2(g) = CO_2 (g) -

 The freezing point depression is equal to the molal freezing point constant times the molality of the solution. The molality is equal to the moles of solute divided by the mass of solvent. The mass of solvent is equal to the total mass of the solution minus the mass of the solute. The total mass of the solution is equal to the mass of the solvent plus the mass of the solute. Therefore, the mass of the solvent is equal to 150 g - 25.1 g = 124.9 g. The moles of solute is equal to 25.1 g / molar mass of solute. The molality is equal to $25.1 g / 124.9 g = 0.201 m$. The freezing point depression is equal to $0.201 m \cdot 5.10 = 1.03°C$. The freezing point depression is equal to the change in freezing point, which is equal to 5.50°C - (-1.92°C) = 7.42°C.

 (1) The rate constant is given by $k = Ae^{-E_A/RT}$. The rate constant at 60°C is $5k$. Therefore $5k = Ae^{-E_A/RT}$. We can solve for $E_A$ by taking the natural log of both sides. $ln(5k) = ln(A) - E_A/RT$. We can solve for $E_A$ by multiplying both sides by $RT$. $RTln(5) = E_A - ln(A)RT$. We can solve for $E_A$ by adding $ln(A)RT$ to both sides. $E_A = ln(A)RT + RTln(5)$. We can solve for $E_A$ by dividing both sides by $RT$. $E_A = ln(A) + ln(5)$.

 The decay time of a radium atom is a random variable with a geometric distribution. The geometric distribution is a discrete distribution that describes the number of Bernoulli trials until the first success. The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is given by:

P(X = k) = p(1 - p)^(k - 1)

where X is the number of trials until the first success, k is the number of trials, and p is the probability of success in a single trial.

In the case of the decay time of a radium atom, the probability of success is the probability that the atom decays in a given year, which is 1/2 since the half-life is 80 years. Therefore, the probability of failure is 1 - p = 1/2.

Now, we want to find the number of bits required to describe the decay time to 3 digit accuracy. To do this, we need to find the entropy of the geometric distribution. The entropy of a discrete random variable X with probability mass function P(X = k) is given by:

P(A) = P(A | B1)P(B1) + P(A | B2)P(B2) + ... + P(A | Bn)P(Bn)
In our case, we have two events, A and B, and we want to find P(A | B). We can rewrite the law of total probability as follows:
P(A) = P(A | B)P(B) + P(A | ¬B)P(¬B)
We are given that P(A) = 1/2, P(B) = 1/3, and P(A | ¬B) = 1

For the input layer, there are $100$ activations and no weights, so there are $100$ biases.

For the first hidden layer, there are $1000$ activations and $1000 \times 1001$ weights, so there are $1000 \times 1001 + 1000 = 110010$ parameters.

 The Euler characteristic of a convex polyhedron is given by the formula V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.
In this case, we have a convex polyhedron with k pentagonal faces and m hexagonal faces. Since all faces are regular, each pentagonal face has 5 edges and each hexagonal face has 6 edges. Therefore, the total number of edges is 5k + 6m.

Now, let's consider the vertices. Each pentagonal face has 5 vertices, and each hexagonal face has 6 vertices. However, since each edge is shared by two faces, we need to divide the total number of edges by 2 to get the total number of vertices. So, the total number of vertices is (5k + 6m) / 2.

Now we can use the Euler characteristic formula:

V - E + F = 2
(5k + 6m) / 2 - (5k + 6m) + k + m = 2

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(a) The bank has $ 100,000 in deposits and has made loans of $ 65,000. The required reserve ratio is 20%, which means that the bank has to keep 20% of the deposits as reserves. Thus, the bank has to keep 20% of $ 100,000, which is $ 20,000, as reserves. The bank has already made loans of $ 65,000, which means that the bank has $ 100,000 - $ 65,000 - $ 20,000 = $ 15,000 in reserves. The bank can lend $ 15,000.

The current deficit is equal to the following:
current deficit = (current government expenditures) - (current tax revenues)
We know that the current government expenditures are $270 billion per year and the current tax revenues are equal to the following:
current tax revenues = (current income) * (current tax rate)
We know that the current income is equal to the following:
current income = (current GNP) - (current savings) - (current investments) - (current trade deficit)
We know that the current GNP is $1,060 billion, the current savings are $106 billion, the current investments are $60 billion, and the current trade deficit is $2.5 billion. Thus, we have:
current income = $1,060 billion - $106 billion - $60 billion - $2.5 billion = $891.5 billion
We know that the current tax rate is 25 percent. Thus, we have:

a) The profit function is given by:
π = P * q - TC
π = (15 - . 05q) * q - (q + .02q^2)
π = 15q - .05q^2 - q - .02q^2
π = 14q - .07q^2
The first derivative of the profit function is given by:
π’ = 14 - .14q
The second derivative of the profit function is given by:
π’’ = - .14
The first derivative is equal to zero at q = 100. The second derivative is negative, which means that the profit function is concave. Therefore, the profit is maximized at q = 100.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
The profit is equal to the difference between the revenue and the cost. The revenue is equal to the price times the quantity. The cost is equal to the fixed cost plus the variable cost. The variable cost is equal to the quantity times the variable cost per unit.
The profit is equal to the following:
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + variable cost)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + (quantity * variable cost per unit))
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + (quantity * $10))
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity)
profit = (price * quantity) - (fixed cost + $10 * quantity

In this case, the characteristic length is the diameter of the missile, which is 1 m. The maximum speed of the missile is 10 m s^-1. Plugging these values into the Reynolds number equation, we get Re = (1000 * 10 * 1) / 1 = 10000. Now, we need to find the mean water tunnel flow velocity for the model. Since the Reynolds number is the same for both the model and the full-scale object, we can use the same equation to find the mean water tunnel flow velocity for the model.

We know that the equation for velocity is v = u + at, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. We also know that the equation for distance is d = ut + 0.5at^2, where d is the distance, u is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration, and t is the time. We can rearrange the equation for velocity to solve for time: t = (v - u)/a. We can then substitute this equation for time into the equation for distance: d = u(v - u)/a + 0.5a(v - u)^2/a. We can then solve for acceleration: a = 2d(v - u)/d^2. We can then plug in the values for velocity and distance: a = 2(50m)(36.11 m/s - 0)/5

The Act was passed in order to make King Henry VIII the Supreme Head of the Church of England. The Act was a result of Henry's desire to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and marry his second wife, Anne Boleyn. The Pope refused to grant Henry a divorce, so Henry decided to break away from the Catholic Church and establish his own church, the Church of England. The Act of Supremacy was a key step in this process, as it made Henry the head of the new church. The Act also had the effect of severing England's ties with the Catholic Church and making England a Protestant nation. The Act of Supremacy was a controversial law, and it was opposed by many people, including Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. However, the Act was eventually passed, and it had a major impact on the history of England. The Act of Supremacy was a key step in the process of the English Reformation, and it helped to shape the course of English history for centuries to come.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on attorney-client privilege for help. Attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects confidential communications between an attorney and their client. It is a fundamental principle of the legal profession that ensures that clients can freely discuss their legal matters with their attorneys without fear of those communications being disclosed to third parties. The privilege applies to all communications made in confidence between an attorney and their client, including conversations, documents, and other materials. The privilege is designed to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients, which is essential for effective legal representation. The privilege is also intended to protect the integrity of the legal system by ensuring that clients can trust their attorneys to keep their communications confidential. The privilege is not absolute, and there are exceptions to the rule. For example, the privilege may be waived if the client discloses the communication to a third party, or if the communication is relevant to a criminal investigation. The privilege may also be limited in certain circumstances, such as when the attorney is representing a client in a matter that involves a conflict of interest. In summary, attorney-client privilege is a legal concept that protects confidential communications between an attorney and their client. It is designed to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients, and to protect

 Let $x$ be the length of the segment between $A$ and $B$. Then the length of the segment between $B$ and $C$ is $10-x$. The length of the segment between $A$ and $C$ is $10-x-x=10-2x$. The triangle inequality states that $x+10-2x>10-x$, or $x>2$. The probability that $x>2$ is $1-P(x \leq 2)=1-[P(x \leq 1)+P(1<x \leq 2)]=1-[P(x \leq 1)+P(x=2)]$.

 The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical method for approximating the solution of a differential equation. The given differential equation is a first-order differential equation, and the initial condition is y(1) = 4. We are asked to find the value of y(0) using the Runge-Kutta method with a step size of h = 0.1.

First, we need to rewrite the given differential equation in the form y' = f(x, y). We have:

y' = (y - 1)^2 * (2x + 3) / (y - 1)^2

Now, we can apply the Runge-Kutta method. The method consists of the following steps:

1. Calculate k1 = h * f(x, y)
2. Calculate k2 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k1/2)
3. Calculate k3 = h * f(x + h/2, y + k2/2)

 The Graeffe's root squaring method is a numerical method for finding the roots of a polynomial. The method is based on the fact that if $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then the roots of $p(x^2)$ are the squares of the roots of $p(x)$.

Let $p(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2$. We first find the roots of $p(x^2)$. We have
$$
p(x^2) = x^6 - 2x^2 + 2 = (x^2 - 1)^3.
$$
The roots of $p(x^2)$ are the squares of the roots of $p(x)$. We have
$$
x^3 - 2x + 2 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 2).

 The trapezoidal rule is given by
\[T_n = \frac{h}{2} \left( f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + \cdots + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n) \right),\]
where $h = \frac{b-a}{n}$.
In our case, $a=0$, $b=8$, $n=4$, and $h = \frac{8-0}{4} = 2$.
We have $f(0)=3$, $f(2)=7$, $f(4)=11$, $f(6)=9$, $f(8)=3$.

 Let $s(t)$ denote the concentration of dye in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0)=1$. We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The fresh water flowing into the tank adds $0$ grams of dye per minute. There are always $200$ liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of dye. So the density of dye in the tank is $s / 200$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 200)=s / 100$ grams of dye per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(0)-(s / 100)=(1-s) / 100$, and so $[s(t)=0.01] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

 The characteristic equation is $r^2 + 5r + 6 = 0$. The roots are $r_1 = -2$ and $r_2 = -3$. The general solution is $y(x) = A e^{-2x} + B e^{-3x}$. The initial conditions give $2 = A + B$ and $2\beta = -2A - 3B$. The second equation gives $A = 2 + \frac{3}{2}\beta$. The first equation gives $B = 2 - \frac{3}{2}\beta$. Then $y_m = A e^{-2x} = 2 + \frac{3}{2}\beta e^{-2x}$. We want $2 + \frac{3}{2}\beta e^{-2x} \geq 4$. This is equivalent to $\frac{3}{2}\beta e^{-2x} \geq 2$. This is equivalent to $\beta \geq \frac{2}{3} e^{2x}$. We want the smallest $\beta$ such that $\beta \geq \frac{2}{3} e^{2x}$ for all

Then $y^{\prime}(0)=\beta=2 \sin (0)+c_{2} \cos (0)=c_{2}$. Then $y=2 \cos (t / 2)+c_{2} \sin (t / 2)$. Then $y^{\prime}=2 \sin (t / 2)-c_{2} \cos (t / 2)$. Then $y^{\prime \prime}=2 \cos (t / 2)+c_{2} \sin (t / 2)$. Then $4 y^{\prime \prime}-y=0$. Then $4(2 \cos (t / 2)+c_{2} \sin (t / 2))-

 We have the following differential equation:
\[
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = 0.5 * x * (1-x)
\]
We can solve this differential equation using Euler's method. We are given the initial condition $p(0)=2$ and we want to approximate $p(2)$ using a step of 1.

First, we need to discretize the differential equation. We can do this by replacing the derivative with a finite difference approximation:

\[
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \approx \frac{p(x+h) - p(x)}{h}
\]

where $h$ is the step size (in this case, 1). Plugging in the given differential equation, we get:

\[
\frac{p(x+1) - p(x)}{1} = 0.5 * x * (1-x)
\]

Now, we can solve for $p(x+1)$:

\[
p(x+1) = p(x) + 0.5 * x * (1-x)
\]

 Stokes' Theorem states that $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\iint_S \left(\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial y}-\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial z}\right) dA$, where $S$ is the surface of the triangle with vertices $(1,0,0),(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$, oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above.

 The bisection method is a method of finding the roots of a real-valued function that is continuous on a closed interval. The method is based on the fact that if a function changes sign at two points in an interval, then it must have a root between those two points.
The bisection method works by repeatedly dividing the interval in half and selecting the half that contains the root. The process is repeated until the interval is small enough that the root can be approximated to the desired level of accuracy.

In this case, we are given the equation tan x + tanh x = 0, and we want to find the smallest positive root of this equation. To do this, we can use the bisection method.

First, we need to find two points in the interval where the function changes sign. We can do this by testing the function at the endpoints of the interval and at the midpoint. Let's choose the interval [0, 1].

At x = 0, tan x + tanh x = 0, so the function changes sign. At x = 1, tan x + tanh x = tan(1) + tanh(1) > 0, so the function does not change

The residue of $f(z)/(z-z_1)(z-z_2)$ at $z=z_1$ is $f(z_1)/(z_1-z_2)$ and the residue of $f(z)/(z-z_1)(z-z_2)$ at $z=z_2$ is $f(z_2)/(z_1-z_2)$.

 The bisection method is a method of finding the roots of a real-valued function that is continuous on a closed interval. The method is based on the mean value theorem for continuous functions. The method is guaranteed to converge to a root of the function if the function is continuous on the interval. The bisection method is a very simple method, and it is often used as a starting point for more sophisticated methods. The bisection method is also known as the interval halving method, the binary search method, or the dichotomy method.

 The botanist is interested in testing $H_0: \mu = 3.5$ versus $H_a: \mu > 3.5$. The test is significant at a 5 percent level of significance. This means that the p-value is less than 0.05. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is the area under the curve of the sampling distribution of the test statistic to the right of the observed test statistic. The sampling distribution of the test statistic is the distribution of the test statistic that would be observed if the null hypothesis were true and the experiment were repeated many times.

 The Graeffe's root squaring method is a numerical method for finding the roots of a polynomial. The method is based on the fact that if $p(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then the roots of $p(x^2)$ are the squares of the roots of $p(x)$.

Let $p(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - 4$. We first find the roots of $p(x^2)$. We have

 The Wronskian of $y_1$ and $y_2$ is $W\left(y_1, y_2\right)=y_1 y_2^{\prime}-y_2 y_1^{\prime}$. Then $W\left(y_1, y_2\right)(2)=y_1(2) y_2^{\prime}(2)-y_2(2) y_1^{\prime}(2)=3$.
The equation $t^2 y^{\prime \prime}-2 y^{\prime}+(3+t) y=0$ is a linear homogeneous second order differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution of this equation is $y=c_1 e^{t}+c_2 e^{-t}$.
Then $y_1=c_1 e^{t}$ and $y_2=c_2 e^{-t}$. Then $y_1^{\prime}=c_1 e^{t}$ and $y_2^{\prime}=-c_2 e^{-t}$. Then $y_1^{\prime}(2)=c_1 e^{2}$ and $y_2^{

 Let $T(t)$ denote the temperature of the coffee at time $t$. Then $T(0)=200^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. We use $T$ and $T(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. Newton's law of cooling states that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $T^{\prime}(t)=k(T(t)-70)$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $T^{\prime}(t)=k(T(t)-70)=k(T(0)-70) e^{-kt}$, and so $T(t)=70+[T(0)-70] e^{-kt}$. Then $190=70+[200-70] e^{-k}$, so $e^{-k}=1 / 2$, and so $k=\ln 2$.

 Let $u(t)=A e^{i \omega t}$. Then $u^{\prime}(t)=i \omega A e^{i \omega t}$ and $u^{\prime \prime}(t)=-\omega^{2} A e^{i \omega t}$. Substituting these into the given equation, we get
\[-\omega^{2} A e^{i \omega t}+\gamma i \omega A e^{i \omega t}+A e^{i \omega t}=0.\]
This is true for all $t$, so we must have
\[-\omega^{2} A+\gamma i \omega A+A=0.\]
Hence $\omega^{2}=\gamma i \omega+1$. The period of the undamped motion is $2 \pi / \omega$. The quasi period of the damped motion is $2 \pi / \omega_{d}$, where $\omega_{d}$ is the solution of $\omega_{d}^{2}=\gamma i \omega_{d}+1$. We want $2 \pi / \omega_{d}=1.5 \pi / \omega$.

 The energy used by the heater is given by $P = I^2 R t$, where $P$ is the power, $I$ is the current, $R$ is the resistance, and $t$ is the time. The power is the energy per unit time, so the energy is $E = P t = I^2 R t$. The energy is used to heat the water, so the change in internal energy of the water is $E = n C_p \Delta T$, where $n$ is the number of moles of water, $C_p$ is the heat capacity of water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. The number of moles of water is $n = m / M = 82.5 \mathrm{~g} / 18.02 \mathrm{~g/mol} = 4.6 \mathrm{~mol}$. The heat capacity of water is $C_p = 75.3 \mathrm{~J/mol-K}$.

 The volume of a right-circular cylinder is $V = \pi R^2 H$, and the surface area is $A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi R H$. We want to minimize the surface area $A$ for a fixed volume $V$. To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We set up the Lagrangian function $L = A - \lambda V$, where $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier. We then take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $R$, $H$, and $\lambda$ and set them equal to zero:

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial R} = 4\pi R + 2\pi H = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial H} = 2\pi R = 0$

$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = V = 0$

From the second equation, we see that $R = 0$. This is not possible, so we must have $H = 0$. This means that the cylinder has no height, and the ratio of the radius $R$ to the height

 The prism is achromatic if the deviation is the same for both wavelengths. The deviation is given by the formula $\delta = \frac{2n\sin\theta}{n-1}$, where $\theta$ is the apex angle of the prism. So for the crown prism, the deviation is $\delta_c = \frac{2n_c\sin\theta_c}{n_c-1} = \frac{2\times1.522\times\sin15^\circ}{1.522-1} = 1.522\times\frac{2\sin15^\circ}{0.522} = 2.4^\circ$. For the flint prism, the deviation is $\delta_f = \frac{2n_f\sin\theta_f}{n_f-1} = \frac{2\times1.662\times\sin\theta_f}{1.662-1} = 2.4^\circ$.

 The electron is moving in a circle, so it must be experiencing a centripetal force. The centripetal force is given by the Lorentz force, which is the cross product of the electron's velocity and the magnetic field. The cross product is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, so the centripetal force is perpendicular to the velocity. The centripetal force is also equal to the mass times the acceleration, which is the change in velocity over time. The change in velocity is the speed of the electron, so the acceleration is the speed of the electron divided by the time it takes to complete one revolution. The time it takes to complete one revolution is the circumference of the circle divided by the speed of the electron. The circumference of the circle is the radius of the circle times the speed of the electron. The radius of the circle is the centripetal force divided by the mass times the speed of the electron.

The phase shift from the first reflection is given by $2\pi n d/\lambda$, where $n$ is the index of refraction, $d$ is the thickness of the film, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. The phase shift from the second reflection is given by $2\pi n d/\lambda$, where $n$ is the index of refraction, $d$ is the thickness of the film, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. So the total phase shift is $4\pi n d/\lambda$. For violet light, $\lambda = 4000 \AA$, so the phase shift is $4\pi n d/\lambda = 4\pi (1.38)(1000 \AA)/(4000 \AA) = 2\pi (1.38) = 2\pi (1.38) = 2\pi (1.38) = 2\pi (1.38) = 2\pi (1.38

 The distance of the rocket from the earth is the sum of the distance from the earth to the nose of the rocket and the length of the rocket. The distance from the earth to the nose of the rocket is the distance traveled by the signal in the time between the two signals being detected. The distance traveled by the signal is the speed of light times the time, or 3.00 × 10^8 m/sec × 17.4 × 10^-6 sec = 5.22 × 10^5 m. The length of the rocket is 600 m. So the distance of the rocket from the earth is 5.22 × 10^5 m + 600 m = 5.22 × 10^5 m + 600 m = 5.28 × 10^5 m.

 The amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator decreases exponentially with time, so the amplitude after four cycles is $A e^{-4 \omega_d t}$, where $\omega_d$ is the damping frequency. The natural frequency of the oscillator is $\omega_0$, and the frequency of the oscillator is $\omega = \omega_0 - \omega_d$. The period of the oscillator is $T = 2 \pi / \omega$, so the time after four cycles is $t = 4 T = 8 \pi / \omega$. Substituting this into the equation for the amplitude, we get $A e^{-4 \omega_d (8 \pi / \omega)} = A e^{-32 \pi \omega_d / \omega}$.

The collision would have also ejected a large amount of material into space, which would have resulted in the Moon having a lower density than Earth. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon having a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon's orbit being not in the same plane as Earth's equator. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon's crust being thicker on the far side than the near side. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon being once entirely molten. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon having a lower density than Earth. The collision would have also resulted in the Moon having a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size.

 The electrostatic force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$, where $k$ is a constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, and $r$ is the distance between them. We can solve for the charge by rearranging the equation to $q_1 q_2 = \frac{F r^2}{k}$. Since the charges are identical, we can divide both sides by $q_1$ to get $q_2 = \frac{F r^2}{k q_1}$. Plugging in the given values, we get $q_2 = \frac{3.7 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~N} \left(5.0 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\right)^2}{9 \times 10^9 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2 \left(3.7 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~N}\right)} = 1.6 \times 10

The escape velocity is given by the formula $v = \sqrt{2GM/R}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the earth, and $R$ is the radius of the earth.

 The heat engine is extracting heat from the water and dumping it into the air. The heat extracted from the water is equal to the heat dumped into the air, so we can use the heat engine's efficiency to relate the two temperatures. The heat engine's efficiency is given by $1 - T_2/T_1$, where $T_1$ is the temperature of the water and $T_2$ is the temperature of the air. So we have $1 - T_2/T_1 = 1/5$, or $T_2/T_1 = 4/5$.

 The rider is slowing down, so the frictional force is in the opposite direction of his motion. The work done by the frictional force is the change in kinetic energy of the rider and cycle, which is 1/2 mv^2, where m is the mass of the rider and cycle and v is the final velocity. The final velocity is 0, so the work done is -1/2 mv^2. The frictional force is the rate of change of this work, so it is -1/2 mv/t, where t is the time it takes to come to a stop. The time is 200 yd/10 mi/hr, or 200/10*5280/3600 hr, or 3.1 sec. So the frictional force is -1/2 mv/t = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -1/2 mv/3.1 = -

 The rocket will lift off when its acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. The acceleration of the rocket is given by Newton's second law, $F = ma$, where $F$ is the net force on the rocket.
