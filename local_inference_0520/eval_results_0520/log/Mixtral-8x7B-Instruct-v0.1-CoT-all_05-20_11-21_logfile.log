 The recombination frequency is the number of recombinant progeny divided by the total number of progeny. In this case, the number of recombinant progeny is the number of plaques on strain K, which is 4. The total number of progeny is the number of plaques on strain B plus the number of plaques on strain K, which is 40 + 4 = 44. The recombination frequency is therefore 4/44 = 0.09, or 9 percent. The answer is not listed, so the question is flawed.

 Bacteria reproduce through binary fission, which is a form of asexual reproduction. In this process, a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. This process does not involve the exchange of genetic material between cells. However, bacteria can acquire new genetic material through a process called conjugation. In conjugation, two bacteria are in direct contact with each other, and one bacterium transfers a plasmid to the other bacterium. This plasmid can contain genes that are not present in the recipient bacterium, and thus, the recipient bacterium acquires new genetic material. To support the existence of this process, we can design an experiment as follows:

1. We can use two strains of bacteria, one that is resistant to a particular antibiotic and one that is sensitive to the antibiotic.
2. We can grow these bacteria on a petri dish that contains the antibiotic.
3. We can then bring the two strains of bacteria into contact with each other, either by allowing them to grow in close proximity to each other or by physically bringing them into contact with each other.
4. After a period of time, we can examine the petri dish to

 The lac operon is a set of genes in E. coli that are responsible for the metabolism of lactose. The lac operon is regulated by the lac repressor, which binds to the operator region of the lac operon and prevents transcription of the structural genes. The lac repressor can be inactivated by the inducer allolactose, which is a byproduct of lactose metabolism. The lac operon contains three structural genes: z, y, and a, which encode for the enzymes beta-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase, respectively. The i gene encodes for the lac repressor. The o gene encodes for the operator region. The c gene encodes for the constitutive mutation of the lac operon. The lac operon is normally inducible, meaning that the structural genes are transcribed only when the inducer is present. However, if the lac operon contains a constitutive mutation, the structural genes are transcribed constitutively, meaning that they are transcribed regardless of the presence of the inducer.

 The degree of gene exchange (m) between two populations is given by the formula $m = \frac{p1 - p2}{p3 - p2}$, where $p1$ is the frequency of the allele in the first population, $p2$ is the frequency of the allele in the second population, and $p3$ is the frequency of the allele in the first population after gene exchange has occurred. In this case, $p1$ is 0.028, $p2$ is 0.446, and $p3$ is 0.028. Substituting these values into the formula, we get $m = \frac{0.028 - 0.446}{0.630 - 0.446} = \frac{-0.418}{0.184} = -2.272$. Since the degree of gene exchange cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the result, which is 2.272. The closest option is (G) 7.4 percent.

Adrenaline is a hormone of the sympathetic system, so it is expected to inhibit the digestive tract. This means that it will slow peristalsis and reduce secretion.

(b) The iris of the eye is innervated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The sympathetic system causes the radial muscles of the iris to contract, resulting in dilation. The parasympathetic system causes the circular muscles of the iris to contract, resulting in constriction.

 The sarcomere is the basic unit of muscle fibers. It is the region between two Z lines, which are the dark lines seen in the muscle fiber. The sarcomere is composed of thick and thin filaments. The thick filaments are composed of myosin, and the thin filaments are composed of actin. The A band is the region of the sarcomere that contains the thick filaments. The I band is the region of the sarcomere that contains the thin filaments. The H zone is the region of the sarcomere that contains only thick filaments. The M line is the region of the sarcomere that contains the thick filaments. Troponin and tropomyosin are proteins that are located on the thin filaments. Troponin and tropomyosin regulate the interaction between actin and myosin. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin. During muscle contraction, the thin filaments slide over the thick filaments, causing the sarcomere to shorten. The A band does not change in length during muscle contraction.

 The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the variables. The alternative hypothesis is that there is an association between the variables. The test statistic is calculated as the sum of the squared difference between the observed and expected frequencies divided by the expected frequency, for each cell in the table. The test statistic is then compared to a critical value from the chi-square distribution with (r-1) \* (c-1) degrees of freedom, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns in the table. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected and it is concluded that there is a significant association between the variables. In this case, the observed frequencies are 55 males and 15 females, and the expected frequencies are 35 males and 35 females. The test statistic is calculated as (55-35)^2/35 + (15-35)^2/35 = 20.57.

 Advanced animal societies are characterized by complex social structures and behaviors. Some of the elements found in advanced animal societies include leadership, territory and dominance hierarchy (E), family structure, food chains and migration patterns (F), and mating rituals and parental care (G). Animals in advanced societies also exhibit adaptation, evolution and species diversity (C), and habitat selection (G). Some animals in advanced societies also exhibit cultural traditions and artistic expression (D). However, language development, agricultural practices, and written communication (A), economic systems, legal structures, and political elections (B) are not elements found in advanced animal societies.

 If a particular character in a certain species of animal were always transmitted from the mother to the offspring, but never from the father to the offspring, we could conclude that the trait is a result of genomic imprinting favoring maternal alleles (A) or an extrachromosomal trait could only be transmitted by the mother (G) or the trait is a result of paternal mitochondrial DNA (H).

 The chi-square test is a statistical test that measures how closely the observed data fits a proposed distribution. The formula for the chi-square test is $\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$, where $O$ is the observed frequency and $E$ is the expected frequency. The expected frequency of yellow cotyledons is $8023 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 6017.25$ and the expected frequency of green cotyledons is $8023 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 2006.75$. The chi-square value is $\chi^2 = \frac{(6022 - 6017.25)^2}{6017.25} + \frac{(2001 - 2006.75)^2}{2006.75} = 0.005 + 0.005 = 0.01$.

 The resting potential of a neuron is the voltage difference across the neuron's membrane when the neuron is not transmitting an impulse. The resting potential is typically around -70 millivolts. The threshold potential is the voltage difference across the neuron's membrane that must be reached before an action potential can occur. The action potential is the rapid, temporary change in the voltage difference across the neuron's membrane that occurs when a neuron is transmitting an impulse. The action potential is triggered when the neuron's membrane potential reaches the threshold potential. The equilibrium potential is the voltage difference across the neuron's membrane that would exist if there were no active transport of ions across the membrane. The graded potential is a change in the voltage difference across the neuron's membrane that is proportional to the size of the stimulus. The graded potential is not an all-or-none phenomenon like the action potential. The refractory period is the time during which a neuron cannot fire another action potential. The refractory period is a safety mechanism that prevents the neuron from firing too many action potentials in rapid succession. The repolarization is the

 The hydrostatic pressure of the blood in the capillaries is higher than the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins. This causes a net movement of fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space. The hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries is highest at the arterial end and lowest at the venous end. The osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins is constant throughout the capillary. The difference between the hydrostatic pressure and the osmotic pressure is called the net filtration pressure. The net filtration pressure is positive at the arterial end of the capillary and negative at the venous end. This means that there is a net movement of fluid out of the capillaries at the arterial end and a net movement of fluid into the capillaries at the venous end. The net movement of fluid out of the capillaries at the arterial end is called filtration and the net movement of fluid into the capillaries at the venous end is called reabsorption. The drop in blood pressure is important in retaining fluid within the capillaries because it increases the net filtration pressure at the venous end of the

P = [r*PV] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]

where:

P = monthly payment
r = monthly interest rate
PV = present value, or the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now, and
n = number of payments (or the loan's term in months).

The monthly interest rate r is the annual interest rate divided by 12.

The present value PV is the total amount of the loan, including all taxes and charges.

In this case, the annual interest rate is not given, but we can assume it is 0% because the question states that the price includes all taxes and charges. Therefore, the monthly interest rate r is also 0%.

The present value PV is $3,462.20.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on economics for help. The elasticity of demand is the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity demanded to a change in price. It is computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. The formula for elasticity is:

$e=\frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}\times \frac{P}{Q}$

We can compute the elasticity value of this demand function by taking the derivative of the demand function with respect to $x$, and then divide it by the demand function itself.

$\frac{dp}{dx}=\frac{-1}{10}$

P = [r*PV] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n]

where:

P = monthly payment
r = monthly interest rate
PV = present value, or the amount of the loan
n = number of payments (or months)

The monthly interest rate is the annual interest rate divided by 12. In this case, r = 6% / 12 = 0.005.

The present value is the amount of the loan, or PV = $60.

The number of payments is the number of months, or n = 15.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P = [0.005 * $60] / [1 - (1 + 0.005)^-15]

P = $0.30 / [1 - 0.8607]

To find John's maximum daily profit, we need to find the quantity of acres John should cut to maximize his profit. To do this, we set marginal cost equal to marginal revenue, which gives us 0.2q + 10 = 20. Solving for q, we get q = 50 acres. To find John's maximum daily profit, we substitute q = 50 into the total cost function, which gives us total cost = 0.1(50)^2 + 10(50) + 50 = 1250. To find John's maximum daily profit, we subtract the total cost from the revenue, which gives us profit = (20 \* 50) - 1250 = 1000 - 1250 = -250.

The total cost is the cost of producing n Gaped Ghouls multiplied by the number of Gaped Ghouls produced in t hours. The number of Gaped Ghouls produced in t hours is t^2 + 100t. Therefore, the total cost is C(t^2 + 100t). The rate of change of the total cost with respect to time is the derivative of C(t^2 + 100t) with respect to t. The derivative of C(n) with respect to n is 0.4n + 1. The chain rule states that the derivative of C(t^2 + 100t) with respect to t is the derivative of C(n) with respect to n multiplied by the derivative of t^2 + 100t with respect to t. The derivative of t^2 + 100t with respect to t is 2t + 100. Therefore, the rate of change of the total cost with respect to time

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on finance for help. The annual cost of renting is $130 \* 12 = $1,560. The annual cost of buying is the annual loan payment. The loan payment can be calculated using the formula:

P = r \* PV / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

where P is the annual payment, r is the annual interest rate, PV is the present value (the amount borrowed), and n is the number of years.

The annual payment is:

P = 0.055 \* $9,000 / (1 - (1 + 0.055)^-3) = $624.50

The annual cost of buying is $624.50 + $375 = $1,000.

The annual cost of buying is $1,000 and the annual cost of renting is $1,560. Both options are equally economical if the annual cost of buying is equal to the annual cost of renting.

 The first law of thermodynamics states that $dU = dq - dw$. For a reversible isothermal process, $dU = 0$, therefore $dq = dw$. The work done by the gas is $dw = -PdV$. The heat absorbed is $dq = 750 cal = 750 \cdot 4.184 = 3138 J$. The work done by the gas is therefore $dw = -3138 J$. The pressure is constant, so we can write $w = -P \Delta V$. The volume change is therefore $\Delta V = -w/P = 3138 J / 1 atm = 3138 L$. The initial volume is $V_i = nRT/P = 2 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 273.15 / 1 = 44.8 L$.

 The barometric formula is $p = p_0 e^{-Mgh/RT}$. We want to find the change in pressure for an infinitesimal change in altitude. We can use the chain rule to find the derivative of $p$ with respect to $h$. We have $\mathrm{d} p = \mathrm{d} p_0 e^{-Mgh/RT} - p_0 e^{-Mgh/RT} \cdot \frac{Mg}{RT} \mathrm{d} h$. We can set $\mathrm{d} p_0 = 0$ since we are only interested in the change in pressure with respect to altitude. We can also substitute $p$ for $p_0 e^{-Mgh/RT}$. We have $\mathrm{d} p = -p \cdot \frac{Mg}{RT} \mathrm{d} h$. We can substitute $p_0 = \frac{pRT}{Mgh}$ to find $p_0 = \frac{1.0 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 288}{0.028 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 11000}$. The answer is

The temperature of the hot block is $T_2 = 373.15 \mathrm{~K}$ and the temperature of the cold block is $T_1 = 273.15 \mathrm{~K}$. The change in entropy is therefore $\Delta S = 0.157 \mathrm{~mol} \cdot 385 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \cdot \ln \left( \frac{373.15 \mathrm{~K}}{273.15 \mathrm{~K}} \right) = 65.3 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{

 First, we need to determine the amount of ilmenite in the soil. 50 kg of soil is 5% ilmenite, so there are 0.05 \* 50 kg = 2.5 kg of ilmenite. The reaction of ilmenite with hydrogen produces water and titanium dioxide. The molar mass of ilmenite is 151.7 g/mol, so 2.5 kg of ilmenite is equal to 2.5 \* 1000 g / 151.7 g/mol = 16.48 mol. The reaction of ilmenite with hydrogen produces 1 mol of water for every mol of ilmenite, so there are 16.48 mol of water produced.

 a) The work done by the system is equal to the negative of the product of the pressure and the change in volume. The volume change is equal to the moles of benzene times the molar volume of an ideal gas at STP. The molar mass of benzene is 78 g/mol, so the number of moles is 100 grains / 78 g/mol = 1.282 moles. The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.4 L/mol, so the volume change is 1.282 moles \* 22.4 L/mol = 28.6 L.

 First, we need to find the weight of H2SO4 in 1000 ml of the solution. The density of the solution is 1.8 g/ml, so 1000 ml of the solution weighs 1800 g. The solution is 90% H2SO4 by weight, so 1800 g of the solution contains 90% \* 1800 g = 1620 g of H2SO4. The molarity of the solution is the moles of H2SO4 divided by the liters of solution. The molar mass of H2SO4 is 98 g/mol, so 1620 g of H2SO4 is equal to 1620 g / 98 g/mol = 16.5 mol. The molarity is therefore 16.5 mol / 1 L = 16.5 M. The normality is the moles of H2SO4 divided by the liters of solution, multiplied by the number of protons in H2SO4, which is 2. Therefore, the normality is

 The boiling point elevation is given by the formula $\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m$, where $K_b$ is the ebullioscopic constant and $m$ is the molality of the solution. The molality is given by the formula $m = \frac{n_{solute}}{m_{solvent} \cdot kg/mol}$. The number of moles of NaCl is given by the formula $n = \frac{m}{M}$, where $m$ is the mass and $M$ is the molar mass. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol. Therefore the number of moles of NaCl is 234 g / 58.44 g/mol = 4.00 mol. The molality is therefore 4.00 mol / (500 g \cdot 1 kg/1000 g) = 0.008 mol/kg. The ebullioscopic constant for water is 0.512°C kg/mol. Therefore the boiling point elevation is 0.512°C kg/m

Here, $x_B = 0.159 \cdot 1000/(1000 + 0.159 \cdot 12.01) = 0.157$. Therefore, $P^0 - P^0 \cdot 0.157 = 752.4$ mm Hg, which means that $P^0 = 890.5$ mm Hg. The molality of the solution is given by $m = 0.159 = \frac{n_B}{m_A \cdot 1000/1000}$ where $m_A$ is the molar mass of the solvent. Therefore, $m_A = 78/0

 We can use the ideal gas law to solve this problem. The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$. We can rearrange this to solve for $P$ as $P = 
rac{nRT}{V}$. We can see that the volume $V$ is constant, and therefore the ratio $
rac{n}{V}$ is also constant. This means that the pressure is directly proportional to the temperature. The temperature in Kelvin is equal to the temperature in Celsius plus 273.15. Therefore the temperature in Kelvin is equal to 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. The temperature in Kelvin after the bulb is packed in dry ice is equal to -73 + 273.15 = 199.15 K. The ratio of the two temperatures is therefore $
rac{300.15}{199.15} = 1.509$. The pressure is directly proportional to the temperature, so the ratio of the two pressures is also equal to 1.509. The initial pressure is 750 mm Hg,

 The freezing point depression is given by the equation $\Delta T_{f} = K_{f} \cdot m$, where $K_{f}$ is the freezing point depression constant and $m$ is the molality. The freezing point depression constant for water is $1.86 ^{\circ}C \cdot kg \cdot mol^{-1}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for molality, $m = \Delta T_{f} / K_{f} = -0.560 ^{\circ}C / 1.86 ^{\circ}C \cdot kg \cdot mol^{-1} = 0.300 \cdot mol \cdot kg^{-1}$. The osmotic pressure is given by the equation $\Pi = M \cdot R \cdot T$, where $M$ is the molarity, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature. We can convert molality to molarity by dividing by the density of the solution. The density of blood is approximately 1.025 g/mL. The molarity is therefore $0.300 \cdot mol \cdot kg^{-1} /

We have 162.1 g of nicotine, and we can convert this to moles by dividing by the molar mass. We have 162.1 g / 162.1 g/mol = 1 mol of nicotine. We can then use the percentages to determine the number of moles of each element. We have 0.740 \* 1 mol = 0.740 mol of carbon, 0.087 \* 1 mol = 0.087 mol of hydrogen, and 0.173 \* 1 mol = 0.173 mol of nitrogen. We can then divide by the smallest number of moles to determine the empirical formula. We have 0.740 mol / 0.087 mol = 8.51 for carbon, 0.087 mol / 0.087 mol = 1 for hydrogen, and 0.173 mol / 0

 The percent dissociation is defined as the ratio of the moles of the dissociated acid to the total moles of the acid. The moles of the dissociated acid is equal to $K_{disso} \cdot [HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}]$. The total moles of the acid is equal to $[HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}]$. Therefore the percent dissociation is equal to $K_{disso} \cdot [HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}] / [HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}] = K_{disso}$. We want this to be equal to 1%, or 0.01. Therefore we have $0.01 = 1.8 \cdot 10^{-5}$. Solving for $[HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}]$ we have $[HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2}] = 0.01 / 1.8 \cdot 10^{-5} = 5.56 \cdot 10^{-3} = 1.8 \cdot 10^{-2}$. The answer is

 First we need to find the number of deuterium atoms in 1 liter of water. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so 1 liter of water contains 1000 g / 18 g/mol = 55.56 mol of water. Since 1/7000 of natural H is D, this means that 1/7000 of the hydrogen atoms in water are deuterium. Therefore, 1 liter of water contains 55.56 mol of water * 2 mol of H per mol of water * 1/7000 = 0.015 mol of deuterium. The energy released by the fusion of 0.015 mol of deuterium is 0.015 mol * 5 MeV/mol = 75 MeV. The energy released by the combustion of 1 mole of gasoline is 5100 KJ/mol * 1000 J/KJ = 5100000 J/mol.

 First we need to determine the molality of the solution of sulfur in benzene. The molality is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the mass of the solvent in kilograms. Here we have 1.2 g of sulfur, which is equal to 0.0012 moles. The mass of the solvent is 50 g, or 0.05 kg. Therefore the molality is 0.0012 moles / 0.05 kg = 0.024 mol / kg. The boiling point elevation is given by the formula $ΔT_{b} = K_{b} \cdot m$, where $K_{b}$ is the ebullioscopic constant and $m$ is the molality. We can rearrange this formula to solve for $K_{b}$: $K_{b} = ΔT_{b} / m = (80.36 - 80.10) / 0.024 = 1.5$. The boiling point elevation for benzene is 2.53 K kg / mol. Therefore the molecular weight

 The rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass of the gas. The molar mass of deuterium is 2.014 g/mol and the molar mass of hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. The ratio of the rate of effusion of deuterium to hydrogen is therefore $\sqrt{1.008/2.014} = 0.707$. The ratio of the number of moles of deuterium to hydrogen is 0.10/0.90 = 0.111. The ratio of the rate of effusion to the mole fraction is therefore $0.707/0.111 = 6.35$. The mole fraction of deuterium in the gas that passes through the pin hole is therefore $1/6.35 = 0.157$. The mole fraction of hydrogen is therefore $1 - 0.157 = 0.843$. The mole % of deuterium is therefore $0.157 \cdot 100 = 15.7%

 Trouton's rule states that the heat of vaporization is equal to $10.5 \cdot 15.0 = 157.5$ J/mol K. The normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to 1 atm. Since the vapor pressure increases by 15 mm Hg per degree, the normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg. This is equal to 760/15 = 50.7 degrees above the boiling point at which the vapor pressure is 1 atm. The boiling point at 1 atm is therefore 760/15 - 50.7 = 25.3 degrees. The heat of vaporization is 157.5 J/mol K $\cdot$ 1000 = 157.5 kJ/mol. The normal boiling point is 25.3 degrees + 273.15 = 298.45 K or 25.3 + 273.15 = 298.

The volume is $V_{2} = V_{1} \cdot P_{1} / P_{2} = 44.4 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \cdot 1 \mathrm{~atm} / 3000 \mathrm{~atm} = 0.0148 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. The change in Gibbs free energy is then $\Delta G = n \cdot R \cdot T \cdot \ln (P_{2} / P_{1}) = (44.4 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / 22.4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{mol}) \cdot 8.314 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{mol

 Charles's law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature in Kelvin. We can rearrange this to say that the temperature is inversely proportional to the density. Therefore, the ratio of the densities at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $-85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is equal to the ratio of the temperatures in Kelvin. The temperature in Kelvin is equal to the temperature in Celsius plus 273.15. Therefore, the ratio of the densities is equal to the ratio of the temperatures in Kelvin, which is equal to the ratio of the temperatures in Celsius plus 273.15. We can rearrange this to find the temperature in Celsius at which the density is zero, which is the absolute zero of temperature. The ratio of the densities is equal to the ratio of the temperatures in Celsius plus 273.15, which is equal to $1.294 / 1.877 = 0.690$. Subtracting 1 from this ratio gives us $0.690 - 1 = -0.3

 The first law of thermodynamics states that $dU = dq - dw$. For an adiabatic process, $dq = 0$. For a reversible process, $dw = -pdV$. Therefore, $dU = -pdV$. The work done by the gas is $W = -pdV = -p \Delta V = -p \cdot A \cdot \Delta x = -1.0 \cdot 10.0 \cdot 0.20 = -2.0 \mathrm{~J}$. The change in internal energy is $\Delta U = -2.0 \mathrm{~J}$. The internal energy of an ideal gas is given by $U = \frac{3}{2} n R T$. Therefore, $\Delta U = \frac{3}{2} n R \Delta T$. We can solve for $\Delta T$ by dividing both sides by $\frac{3}{2} n R$ to get $\Delta T = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\Delta U}{n R} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{-2.0}{2.0 \cdot 8.314}

 The mole fraction of a component in a solution is defined as the ratio of the number of moles of that component to the total number of moles of all components. The weight percent of a component is the ratio of the weight of that component to the total weight of the solution. We can convert the weight percent to moles by dividing by the molar mass of the component. The molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol. Therefore the number of moles of NaOH is 0.50 \cdot 100 / 40 = 1.25 moles. The total number of moles is the sum of the moles of NaOH and the moles of water. The moles of water is the weight of water divided by the molar mass of water, which is 18 g/mol. The weight of water is the total weight minus the weight of NaOH, or 100 - 50 = 50 g. The moles of water is therefore 50 / 18 = 2.78 moles. The total number of moles is therefore 1.25 + 2.7

The pK value is the pH at which the amino acid is 50% ionized. The pK_1' value is the pK value for the alpha-carboxyl group, and the pK_2' value is the pK value for the alpha-amino group. The pK_R' value is the pK value for the R-group. For glycine, the pK_1' value is 2.34 and the pK_2' value is 9.6. The pH_I value is calculated as follows: pH_I = pK_1' + log([A]/[HA]) = 2.34 + log([A]/[HA]). At pH_I, [A] = [HA], so the equation simplifies to pH_I = pK_1' + log

Therefore we can write the ratio of the two temperatures as $$\frac{T_{100}}{T_{0}} = \frac{p_{100} V_{100}}{p_{0} V_{0}} = \frac{40}{28}.$$ We can rearrange this to find $T_{100} = \frac{40}{28} T_{0}$. We are also told that the boiling point of hydrogen is $100^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and that the boiling point of hydrogen on Earth is $20 \mathrm{~K}$. Therefore we can write $T_{100} = 100^{\circ} \mathrm{N} + 20 \mathrm{~K}$. We can substitute this into the previous equation to find $T_{0} = \frac{28}{40} \cdot 100^{\circ} \mathrm{N} + \frac{28}{

 First we compute the volume of the nucleus, which is given by the formula $V = 4/3 \pi r^3$. Plugging in the radius, we get $V = 4/3 \pi (4 \times 10^{-13} cm)^3 = 2.5 \times 10^{-39} cm^3$. The density is given by the formula $d = m/V$, where $m$ is the mass of the nucleus. The mass of the nucleus is given by the number of nuclei times the mass of each nucleus. The mass of each nucleus is given by the mass of the sample divided by the number of nuclei. Therefore the mass of each nucleus is $39 g / 6.02 \times 10^{23} = 6.5 \times 10^{-23} g$. The mass of the nucleus is therefore $2.00 \times 10^{23} \times 6.5 \times 10^{-23} g = 1.3 \times 10^{-20} g$. The density is therefore $d = 1.

 The activity of a component in a solution is defined as the ratio of the partial pressure of that component in the solution to the partial pressure of that component in the pure state. The activity coefficient is the ratio of the activity to the mole fraction of the component. The mole fraction of C2H5OH in a 40% solution is 0.40. The partial pressure of C2H5OH in the solution is 60 torr. The partial pressure of C2H5OH in the pure state is 20 torr. The activity of C2H5OH is therefore 60/20 = 3.0.

We can use the molar masses of the reactants and products to convert the mass of the reactants to moles. The molar mass of VO is 67 g/mol, so 2 g of VO is equal to 2/67 = 0.0299 moles. The molar mass of Fe2O3 is 160 g/mol, so 5.75 g of Fe2O3 is equal to 5.75/160 = 0.0359 moles. We can see that we have more Fe2O3 than VO, so the limiting reactant is VO.

The molar heat capacity at constant pressure for an ideal gas is given by the equation Cp = (5/2)nR, where n is the number of moles of gas and R is the gas constant. For a solid, the molar heat capacity at constant pressure is given by the equation Cp = 3nR. For H2O(g), we are told that the contribution to Cp from the vibrational mode is 20%. This means that the contribution from the rotational and translational modes is 80% of the total. The rotational and translational modes of an ideal gas are given by the equation Cp = (7/2)nR.

 We are given that we have 10 vertices and 5 connected components, and that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components.
We can think of this problem as choosing 5 vertices from the 10 available vertices to form our connected components, and then choosing a labelled forest for each connected component.
The number of ways to choose 5 vertices from 10 is C(10, 5) = 252.
For each connected component, we can choose any number of vertices from the remaining vertices to form a tree. The number of ways to choose k vertices from n is C(n, k).
For the first connected component, we can choose any number of vertices from the remaining 5 vertices, so there are 2^5 = 32 possible choices.
For the second connected component, we can choose any number of vertices from the remaining 4 vertices, so there are 2^4 = 16 possible choices.

 We are given that P(D) = 0.05, P(TP | D) = 0.99, and P(TN | D') = 0.97. We want to find P(D | TP).
We can use Bayes' theorem to find the answer:

We can construct such a graph by first choosing 6 of the 13 vertices to be the vertices of degree 1, and then connecting each of these vertices to one of the remaining 7 vertices of degree 2.
There are 13 choose 6 ways to choose the 6 vertices of degree 1, which is 13! / (6! * (13-6)!) = 1716.
There are 7! ways to connect the 6 vertices of degree 1 to the 7 vertices of degree 2, which is 5040.

We can solve for $t$ in terms of $\tau$ by substituting the upper and lower bounds of the integral, which gives us $0 \leq t \leq \tau$ and $\tau-3 \leq t \leq \tau$.

The measured round-trip times (RTTM) for the 6 segments are 68ms, 42ms, 65ms, 80ms, 38ms, and 75ms, respectively.
Now we can calculate the new RTTs and RTTD as follows:
New RTTs = a * RTTm + (1-a) * RTTs
New RTTD = B * |RTTm - RTTs| + (1-B) * RTTD
New RTO = RTTs + 4 * RTTD
Where RTTm is the measured RTT.
Let's calculate the new RTTs and RTTD for the first segment:
New RTTs = 0.15 * 68 + (1-0

We are asked to use Fano's inequality to find the capacity for this channel. Fano's inequality states that the mutual information between the input and output of a channel is bounded by the entropy of the input, i.e. $I(X;Y) \leq H(X)$.
In this case, the mutual information between the input and output of the channel is given by $I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$. We can use the fact that $Y_i = \frac{1}{i}X

 A tree is a connected acyclic graph. If there are no vertices of degree 1 or 2, then every vertex must have degree at least 3. Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges, the number of edges in the graph must be at least n/2. Since the graph is acyclic, it must have at most n-1 edges. Thus, the number of edges must be exactly n-1. Since every vertex has degree at least 3, the number of vertices of degree 3 must be at least n/3. Since the sum of the degrees of all vertices is 2(n-1), the sum of the degrees of all vertices of degree 3 must be exactly 2(n-1) - 2(n/3) = 4n/3. Since the number of vertices of degree 3 is at least n/3, the number of vertices of degree 3 must be exactly n/3. Since every vertex has degree at least 3, the number of vertices of degree 3 must be exactly n. Since the graph is connected, it must be a tree. Since every vertex has degree 3, the tree must

 We are given that we have 8 vertices and 5 connected components, and that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components.
Since vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components, we can assume that they are already connected.

 The channel capacity is given by the mutual information between the input and output, which is $I(X; Y) = h(Y) - h(Y|X)$. Since $Y = X + Z$, where $Z$ is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, we have $h(Y|X) = h(Z) = 0.5 \log(2 \pi e)$.
To find $h(Y)$, we can use the fact that $Y$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $E(Y) = E(X)$ and variance $Var(Y) = Var(X) + 1$. Since $E(Y)^2 \leq 2$, we have $E(X)^2 \leq 2 - 1 = 1$. Therefore, the maximum entropy of $X$ is achieved when $X$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 1. In this case, $Y$ is also a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 2. Therefore, $h(Y) = 0.5 \log(2 \pi e 2)$.

I. M-7’s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5’s pipeline.
The throughput of a pipeline is the number of instructions that can be completed in a given time period. Since M-7 has a shorter clock cycle, it can complete more instructions in a given time period than M-5.
II. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7’s pipeline than on M-5’s pipeline.
The latency of a pipeline is the time it takes to complete a single instruction. Since M-7 has a shorter clock cycle, it can complete a single instruction in less time than M-5.
III. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.
This statement is not necessarily true. While M-7 has a shorter clock cycle and better throughput, it also has a longer pipeline. This means that it may take longer for an instruction to move through the pipeline in M-7 than in M-5. Additionally, if the program being executed has a high degree of branching or other control flow, the longer pipeline in M-7 may result in more pipeline stalls, further reducing its performance.

 A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that each edge of the graph is incident to at least one vertex of the set. The minimum vertex cover is the smallest possible vertex cover.
To find the minimum vertex cover, we can use the following greedy algorithm:
1. Start with an empty vertex cover.
2. While there are edges that are not covered, add to the vertex cover the endpoint of an uncovered edge that is incident to the largest number of uncovered edges.
3. Stop when all edges are covered.
Applying this algorithm to the graph G, we start with an empty vertex cover. We can see that the edge <0,1> is not covered, and that the endpoint 0 is incident to one uncovered edge and the endpoint 1 is incident to two uncovered edges. Thus, we add 1 to the vertex cover.
Next, we can see that the edges <2,0>, <2,1>, and <2,3> are not covered. The endpoint 0 is incident to one uncovered edge, the endpoint 1 is incident to one uncovered edge, and the endpoint 2 is incident to three uncovered edges. Thus, we add 2 to the vertex cover

Since the sum of the angles at all vertices is at least 360 degrees, we have k \* 540 + m \* 720 >= 360 \* (k + m).

Since the tree is rooted, the sum of the lengths of all root-to-leaf paths is at least N-1. Since the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by c, the sum of the lengths of all root-to-leaf paths is at most c(N-1).

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on accounting for help. First, we calculate the earnings before taxes (EBT) and then the net income (NI) by multiplying EBT by (1 - tax rate). Then, we calculate the dividends as the net income minus the change in retained earnings.
EBT = sales - cost of goods sold - administrative expenses - depreciation - all other expenses = $3,000,000 - $1,500,000 - $300,000 - $800,000 - $100,000 = $300,000
NI = EBT \* (1 - tax rate) = $300,000 \* (1 - 0.48) = $300,000 \* 0.52 = $156,000
Dividends = NI - change in retained earnings = $156,000 - $100,000 = $56,000
If the tax rate fell to 45%, then the net income would be $3

The marginal cost of production is the sum of the marginal cost of labor and the marginal cost of capital. The marginal cost of labor is the wage rate times the marginal physical product of labor. The marginal cost of capital is the rental rate times the marginal physical product of capital. We are given that the wage rate is $4 and the rental rate is $1. We are also given that the marginal physical product of labor is $2. We are asked to find the marginal physical product of capital and the total cost of production. We can set up the following equation:

The bank has excess reserves of $25,000, which means that the bank is holding more than the required amount of reserves. The bank has made a total of $100,000 in loans, which means that the bank has $100,000 in loans and $25,000 in excess reserves. The bank's demand deposit liabilities must be equal to the bank's loans and excess reserves divided by the required reserve ratio. We have:
demand deposit liabilities = (loans + excess reserves) / required reserve ratio
demand deposit liabilities = ($100,000 + $25,000) / 0.10

a) The point of profit maximization is found by setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost.
Marginal revenue is given by:
MR = P + q(dP/dq)
dP/dq is the derivative of the demand function with respect to q.
dP/dq = -0.05
Thus,
MR = P - 0.05q
Marginal cost is given by:
MC = d(TC)/dq
d(TC)/dq is the derivative of the total cost function with respect to q.
d(TC)/dq = 1 + 0.04q
Thus,
MC = 1 + 0.04q
Setting MR equal to MC, we have:
P - 0.05q = 1 + 0.04q
Solving for q, we get:
q = 110
Substituting q = 110 into the demand function, we get:
P = 12
Thus, the point of profit maximization is (q*, P*)

The money supply is affected by the FED adding $500,000 to the reserves of the banking system, the required reserve ratio of 30%, the banks maintaining no excess reserves, and the public increasing its holdings of currency by $200,000. The money supply is calculated as follows:
money supply = (required reserve ratio) x (total deposits) + (excess reserves) + (currency held by the public)
We know that the FED added $500,000 to the reserves of the banking system, the required reserve ratio is 30%, and the banks maintain no excess reserves. Thus, the total deposits are $500,000 / 0.3 = $1,666,667. The currency held by the public is $200,000. Thus, the money supply is:
money supply = (0.3) x ($1,666,667) + (0) + ($200,000) = $500,000 + $20

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on finance for help. a) The optimal number of transactions to make (n) so as to maximize the amount of interest received from the bonds is when the marginal cost of transaction equals the marginal benefit of transaction. The marginal cost of transaction is b and the marginal benefit of transaction is the interest received from the bonds. The interest received from the bonds is i times the amount of bonds. The amount of bonds is Z minus the amount of bonds sold. The amount of bonds sold is n times the cost of transaction. Therefore, the optimal number of transactions to make (n) so as to maximize the amount of interest received from the bonds is when the marginal cost of transaction equals the marginal benefit of transaction, which is when b equals i times (Z minus n times b). b) If you have $10,000 in bonds, the interest rate is 10%, the cost of transactions is $5, the optimal amount of transactions is when the marginal cost of transaction equals the marginal benefit of transaction, which is when $5 equals 10% times ($10,000 minus n times $5).

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. To maximize profits, we need to find the marginal product of labor and compare it to the wage rate. The marginal product of labor is the change in total physical product when one more worker is hired. We can calculate it as follows:
marginal product of labor = total physical product with n workers - total physical product with n-1 workers
We can calculate the marginal product of labor for each worker as follows:
marginal product of labor for worker 1 = 15 - 0 = 15
marginal product of labor for worker 2 = 25 - 15 = 10
marginal product of labor for worker 3 = 33 - 25 = 8
marginal product of labor for worker 4 = 38 - 33 = 5
marginal product of labor for worker 5 = 42 - 38 = 4
We can see that the marginal product of labor is decreasing as more workers are hired. To maximize profits, Mr. Falbo should hire workers until the marginal product of labor is equal to the wage rate. In this case

 First, we need to find the initial mass of methane in the tank. The density of methane at 8 atm and 273 K is 0.68 kg/m^3. The initial mass of methane is therefore 0.68 kg/m^3 \* 1.5 m^3 = 1.02 kg. The volume of the vapor is 0.7 \* 1.5 m^3 = 1.05 m^3. The volume of the liquid is 0.3 \* 1.5 m^3 = 0.45 m^3. The mass of the liquid is 0.45 m^3 \* 422.2 kg/m^3 = 190.1 kg.

 The heat generated by the bearing is given by the product of the load, the speed, and the coefficient of friction. This is 1200 lbs. \* 100 rpm \* 0.025 = 3000 Watts.

 The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature at which the combustion reaction occurs with no heat transfer to or from the surroundings. To find this temperature, we need to use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in enthalpy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. In this case, the heat added to the system is zero, so the change in enthalpy is equal to the negative of the work done by the system. The work done by the system is equal to the product of the pressure and volume change of the system. Since the volume change is not given, we cannot directly calculate the work done by the system. However, we can use the fact that the combustion reaction is adiabatic to find the final temperature of the system.

 The heat generated per unit volume is given by J^2 \rho, where J is the current density. The heat flow through the plate is given by q = -k dT/dx, where k is the thermal conductivity. The heat flow is also given by q = J^2 \rho A L, where A is the cross-sectional area and L is the length. Setting these equal and solving for dT/dx, we get dT/dx = -J^2 \rho L / k. Integrating this, we get T(x) = T(0) - J^2 \rho L x^2 / (2 k). Plugging in the given values, we get T(x) = 1500 - (12^2 \* 1.25 \* 10^-4 \* 2.5) \* x^2 / (2 \* 2.8).

 The speed of a motor is given by the equation N = (V - I*R) / (K \phi), where V is the voltage, I is the current, R is the resistance, K is a constant, and \phi is the flux. Since the voltage is constant, and the resistance is constant, the only thing that changes is the flux. The flux is proportional to the field current, so a 10% increase in field current corresponds to a 10% increase in flux. So the new speed is given by N' = (V - I'*R) / (1.1 \* K \* \phi) = (V - I'*R) / (1.1 \* N \* K \* \phi / (V - I \* R)) = (V - I'*R) / (1.1 \* N \* (V - I \* R) / (V - I'*R)) = (V - I'*R) / (1.1 \* N) = (110 - 50 \* 0.1) / (1.1 \* 1200) = 1000 rpm.

 The order of a group is the number of its elements.
Statement 1: The order of a group is 159. The prime factorization of 159 is $3 \times 53$. By the Sylow theorems, there is a subgroup of order 53. Since 53 is prime, this subgroup is cyclic. Let $H$ be this subgroup. Since 159 is not divisible by $53^{2}$, the normalizer of $H$ is the whole group. Hence $H$ is a normal subgroup. Since $H$ is cyclic, it is abelian. Hence the quotient group $G / H$ is abelian. Since $H$ is a normal subgroup, $G / H$ is a group. Since $G / H$ is abelian, $G$ is solvable. Since $G$ is solvable, $G$ is cyclic.

Then $f_x = 2x$, $f_y = 2y$, $g_x = y$, and $g_y = x$. We have $f_x = \lambda g_x$ and $f_y = \lambda g_y$. Then $2x = \lambda y$ and $2y = \lambda x$. Then $x^2 = y^2$. Then $x = y$ or $x = -y$.

Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=1-(s / 50)=(50-s) / 50$, and so $[s(t)=50] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

 The Wronskian $W\left(y_1, y_2\right)$ of $y_1$ and $y_2$ is defined by $W\left(y_1, y_2\right)(t)=y_1(t) y_2^{\prime}(t)-y_1^{\prime}(t) y_2(t)$. The Wronskian of any fundamental set of solutions of a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation is never zero. The Wronskian satisfies the Abel identity $W^{\prime}(t)=-p(t) W(t)$, where $p(t)$ is the coefficient of $y^{\prime \prime}$ in the differential equation. In this case, $p(t)=t$. Then $W^{\prime}(t)=-t W(t)$. Let $f(t)=W(t)$. Then $f^{\prime}(t)=-t f(t)$. Then $f(t)=C e^{-t^2 / 2}$, where $C \in \mathbb{R}$. Since $W\left(y_1, y_2\right)(1)=2$, we have $C=2$. Then

 Let $X$ be the length of the segment $AB$. Then $X$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,10]$. Let $Y$ be the length of the segment $AC$. Then $Y$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,X]$. Let $Z$ be the length of the segment $BC$. Then $Z$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[0,X]$. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Hence, for the three segments to form the sides of a triangle, we need $X < Y + Z$, $Y < X + Z$, and $Z < X + Y$. The probability that $X < Y + Z$ is the probability that $X$ is less than the sum of two random variables uniformly distributed on $[0,X]$. This probability is $1/2$. Similarly, the probability that $Y < X + Z$ is $1/2$, and the probability that $Z < X + Y$ is $1/2$. Hence the probability that all three inequalities are satisfied is $(1/2)

The probability that $Y > 3$ is also $1 / 8$.

 Since $f$ is a linear transformation, we have $f(3, 5) = 3f(1, 1) + 5f(0, 1) = 3 + 5f(0, 1)$. Since $f$ is a linear transformation, we have $f(0, 1) = f(0, 1) - f(0, 0) = f((0, 0) + (0, 1)) - f(0, 0) = f(0, 0) + f(0, 1) - f(0, 0) = f(0, 1)$. Hence $f(3, 5) = 3 + 5f(0, 1) = 3 + 5f(0, 0) + 5f(0, 1) - 5f(0, 0) = 3 + 5f(0, 0) + 5f(0, 1) = 3 + 5f(-1, 0) - 5f(-1, 0) + 5f(0, 1) = 3

 Since the polygons are similar, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides is constant. Let $k$ be this constant. Then $k = \frac{AF}{ZV} = \frac{CD}{YZ} = \frac{DF}{WY}$. Hence $DF = k \cdot WY = k \cdot 6$. Also $DF = AC + CD = AC + 9$. Hence $AC = DF - 9 = k \cdot 6 - 9$. Also $AC = \frac{AF}{k} = \frac{12}{k}$. Hence $k \cdot 6 - 9 = \frac{12}{k}$. Hence $k^2 \cdot 6 - 9k = 12$. Hence $k^2 - 1.5k - 2 = 0$. Hence $(k - 2)(k + 1) = 0$. Hence $k = 2$. Hence $DF = k \cdot 6 = 12$. Hence $AC = \frac{12}{k} = 6$.

 The spring constant $k$ is given by $k=m g / \Delta x$, where $m$ is the mass, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\Delta x$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. Then $k=100 \cdot 9.8 / 0.05=19600 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$. The equation of motion is $m x^{\prime \prime}+k x=0$, where $x$ is the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position. Then $x^{\prime \prime}+196 x=0$. The characteristic equation is $r^{2}+196=0$, and so $r=\pm 14 i$. Then $x=A \cos (14 t)+B \sin (14 t)$. Since $x^{\prime}(0)=10$, we have $14 B=10$, and so $B=10 / 14=5 / 7$. Since $x(0)=0$, we have $A=0$. Then $x=5 / 7 \sin (14 t)$. The

 The temperature of the bar at time $t$ is given by the formula
\[u(x, t) = \frac{200}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin \left( \frac{n \pi x}{20} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \alpha t}{400} \right),\]
where $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of silver. The temperature at the center of the bar is given by $u(10, t)$. The value of $\alpha$ is $1.68 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^2 / \mathrm{s}$. Hence
\[u(10, 30) = \frac{200}{\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin \left( \frac{n \pi}{2} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \alpha t}{400} \right) = \frac{200}{\pi} \sum

 The interquartile range is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. For a normal distribution, the z-score for the 25th percentile is -0.67 and the z-score for the 75th percentile is 0.67. The z-score for the mean is 0. The z-score for a point $x$ is $z=(x-mu) / sigma$, where $mu$ is the mean and $sigma$ is the standard deviation. Then the z-scores for the 25th and 75th percentiles are $z=-0.67$ and $z=0.67$, respectively. Then the 25th percentile is $x=-0.67 sigma + mu$ and the 75th percentile is $x=0.67 sigma + mu$. Then the interquartile range is $x=0.67 sigma + mu - (-0.67 sigma + mu)=1.34 sigma$. Then the interquartile range is $1.34(4)=5.3

 The z-score is defined as $z = (x - \mu) / \sigma$, where $x$ is the raw score, $\mu$ is the mean, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. We are given that the z-score is the same for both the midterm and the final exam. We are also given that the student received a 58 on the midterm. We are asked to find the student's final exam score.
Let $x$ be the student's final exam score. Then
$$
z = (58 - 52) / 4 = (x - 112) / 10.

Solving for $x$, we get

x = 10z + 112.

 The trapezoidal rule states that the area under the curve is approximately equal to the sum of the areas of the trapezoids formed by the points on the curve. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = (b_1 + b_2) \cdot h / 2$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. In this case, the length of the interval is $8$, and we are dividing it into $4$ subintervals, so the length of each subinterval is $8 / 4 = 2$. The points on the curve are $(0, 3)$, $(2, 7)$, $(4, 11)$, $(6, 9)$, and $(8, 3)$. The areas of the trapezoids are as follows:

We want to maximize 3x + y.

First, we graph the constraints. The constraint -x + y <= 1 is equivalent to y <= x + 1. The constraint 2x + y <= 4 is equivalent to y <= -2x + 4. The constraint x >= 0 is equivalent to x is on the positive x-axis. The constraint y >= 0 is equivalent to y is on the positive y-axis.

The feasible region is the area below the line y = x + 1, below the line y = -2x + 4, and in the first quadrant.

The flow of fresh water into the tank adds $0$ grams of dye per minute. There are always 200 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of dye. So the density of dye in the tank is $s / 200$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 200)=s / 100$ grams of dye per minute.

 The norm $||x||_p$ is expressable as an inner product if and only if there exists a positive definite matrix $A$ such that $||x||_p = \sqrt{x^T A x}$. This is equivalent to $||x||_p^2 = x^T A x$.
If $p = 2$, then $||x||_2^2 = x^T x$, so $A = I$ is a positive definite matrix.
If $p = 1$, then $||x||_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|$, which is not expressable as an inner product.
If $p = 0$, then $||x||_0 = \#\{i : x_i \neq 0\}$, which is not expressable as an inner product.
If $p = \infty$, then $||x||_{\infty} = \max_{i=1}^n |x_i|$, which is not expressable as an inner product.
If $p < 1$, then $||x||_p$ is not a norm, so it is not expressable as an inner product.

 We have 8 vertices and 2 colors. We can color the first vertex in 2 ways. The second vertex can be colored in 2 ways as well. However, if the first two vertices have the same color, then the third vertex can be colored in 1 way. If the first two vertices have different colors, then the third vertex can be colored in 2 ways.

 The two-proportion z-test is used to compare the proportions of two groups. The null hypothesis is that the two proportions are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal. In this case, the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of female students who oppose the dress code is different from the proportion of male students who oppose the dress code. The test statistic is a z-score, which is calculated as the difference between the two sample proportions divided by the standard error of the difference. The standard error is calculated using the formula $sqrt{p(1-p)left(1 / n_{1}+1 / n_{2}ight)}$, where $p$ is the pooled proportion, $n_{1}$ is the sample size of the first group, and $n_{2}$ is the sample size of the second group. The z-score is then compared to a critical value from the standard normal distribution to determine the p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a z-score as extreme or more extreme than the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value is the probability of observing a z-score as extreme

 Let $a, b, c$ be the three numbers in the arithmetic progression, and let $d, e, f$ be the three numbers in the geometric progression. Then $a = 9$, $b = a + d$, and $c = a + 2d$. Also $e = b + 2 = a + d + 2$ and $f = e + 20 = a + d + 22$. Since $e / b = f / e$, we have $e^2 = fb$, and so $e^2 = (a + d + 2)(a + d + 22)$. Since $d = b - a = b - 9$, we have $e^2 = (b - 7)(b + 13)$. Since $f$ is the smallest possible value, $e$ is the smallest possible value for the geometric mean of $b$ and $f$, and so $e$ is the smallest possible value for $\sqrt{b(b + 22)}$. Since $b$ is the second term of an arithmetic progression with first term $a = 9$ and third term $c = a

 The number $abc$ is a multiple of 60, hence $a, b, c$ are either all even or all odd. If $a, b, c$ are all even, then $a, b, c$ are all multiples of 6, hence $abc$ is a multiple of 6^3 = 216. The smallest such $abc$ is 6 \* 6 \* 6 = 216. The largest such $abc$ is 12 \* 12 \* 12 = 1728. The number of such $abc$ is $\frac{1728-216}{6}+1=256$. The probability of this case is $\frac{256}{6^3 \cdot 6}=\frac{1}{108}$. If $a, b, c$ are all odd, then $a, b, c$ are all multiples of 3, hence $abc$ is a multiple of 3^3 = 27.

 The percentile of a score is the percentage of scores lower than that score. So Mary scored higher than 64% of the test takers, and Pam scored higher than 56% of the test takers.

(A) is true because 100 - 56 = 44, so 36% of the test takers scored lower than Pam.

(B) is false because the percentages of test takers scoring higher than Mary and Pam are 36% and 44%, respectively, and these percentages do not add up to 8%.

(C) is false because the percentiles of the scores do not tell us the percentages of the total points scored by Mary and Pam.

(D) is false because the percentiles of the scores do not tell us the actual number of points scored by Mary and Pam.

(E) is true because Mary's score is 64 - 56 = 8% higher than Pam's score.

 The largest possible value of $k$ is the number of terms in the sequence. The first term is $a$, and the last term is $a r^{n-1}$. The common ratio is $r$, and the number of terms is $n$. The number of digits in a positive integer $m$ is $\lfloor \log _{10} m\rfloor +1$. The number of digits in $a r^{n-1}$ is $\lfloor \log _{10} a r^{n-1}\rfloor +1$. Since $r>1$, we have $\lfloor \log _{10} a r^{n-1}\rfloor \geq \lfloor \log _{10} a\rfloor +(n-1)$. Hence the number of digits in $a r^{n-1}$ is at least $\lfloor \log _{10} a\rfloor +n$.

 Rowena can paint a room in $14$ hours, hence she paints $1/14$ of the room per hour. Ruby can paint a room in $6$ hours, hence she paints $1/6$ of the room per hour.
If Rowena paints for $x$ hours and Ruby paints for $y$ hours, they will finish half of the painting, hence
\[
\frac{1}{14}x + \frac{1}{6}y = \frac{1}{2}.

If Rowena paints for $y$ hours and Ruby paints for $x$ hours, they will paint the whole room, hence

First, we prove that $n = 15$ is sufficient. We will use the probabilistic method. Let $G$ be a random graph on 15 vertices, where each edge is colored red with probability $1 / 2$ and blue with probability $1 / 2$, independently of all other edges. For each $v \in V(G)$, let $N_{v}$ be the set of all vertices in $G$ that are adjacent to $v$. Then $|N_{v}|=14$ for all $v \in V(G)$. For each $v \in V(G)$, let $X_{v}$ be the number of red edges in $N_{v}$. Then $X_{v}$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $14$ and $1 / 2$.

Let $T$ be the set of all elements of $S$ that are not in $K$. Let $U$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are of the form $k s$, where $k \in K$ and $s \in S$. Then $U$ is a subgroup of $G$, and $T$ is a basis for $U$. Let $V$ be the set of all elements of $G$ that are of the form $k s$, where $k \in K$ and $s \in T$. Then $V$ is a subgroup of $U$, and $V$ is a basis for $K$. Hence $K$ is free abelian.

 We can solve this problem without knowing the size of the jury pool. Let $n$ be the size of the jury pool. The probability that a particular juror is a woman is $0.3$, and the probability that a particular juror is a man is $0.7$. The probability that a jury of 12 meets the requirements of the trial is the probability that at least three jurors are women. This is the sum of the probabilities that exactly three jurors are women, exactly four jurors are women, and so on, up to exactly nine jurors are women. The probability that exactly $k$ jurors are women is the probability that $k$ of the 12 jurors are women and the other $12-k$ jurors are men. This is the number of ways to choose $k$ women from the $0.3 n$ women in the pool, times the number of ways to choose $12-k$ men from the $0.7 n$ men in the pool, divided by the number of ways to choose 12 jurors from the $n$ potential jurors.

 We need to find a pair of ratios that can form a proportion. A proportion is a statement that two ratios are equal. We can write a proportion as $a / b = c / d$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are numbers. We can cross-multiply to get $ad = bc$. We can check each pair of ratios to see if they satisfy this equation.
Option A: $2 / 5 = 4 / 25$
Cross-multiply to get $2 \cdot 25 = 5 \cdot 4$
Simplify to get $50 = 20$
This is not true, so this pair of ratios cannot form a proportion.
Option B: $2 / 5 = 5 / 10$
Cross-multiply to get $2 \cdot 10 = 5 \cdot 5$

 Since the graph of $f$ is increasing on $[a, b]$, we have $f(a) \leq f(x) \leq f(b)$ for all $x \in[a, b]$. Then $f(a)$ is the smallest value of $f$ on $[a, b]$, and $f(b)$ is the largest value of $f$ on $[a, b]$. Since the graph of $f$ is concave up on $[a, b]$, the graph of $f$ lies above the line segment connecting $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$. Then $f(x) \geq f(a)+(x-a) \cdot(f(b)-f(a)) /(b-a)$ for all $x \in[a, b]$. Then $f(x) \geq f(a)+(x-a) \cdot f^{\prime}(c)$ for some $c \in(a, b)$.

 If the graph of $y=f(x)$ is shifted 20 units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=f(x)$. Hence $f(x) = f(x - 20)$.
Let $g(x) = f(x / 5)$. Then $g(x) = f(x / 5) = f((x / 5) - 20) = f(x / 5 - 20 \cdot 5 / 5) = f(x / 5 - 100 / 5) = f(x / 5 - 20)$.
Hence $g(x) = f(x / 5 - 20)$.
If the graph of $y=g(x)$ is shifted $a$ units to the right, then the resulting graph is identical to the original graph of $y=g(x)$. Hence $g(x) = g(x - a)$.
Hence $f(x / 5) = f(x / 5 - a)$.
Hence $f(x) = f(x - 5a)$.

 The most representative sample would be obtained by surveying people at the entrance to the mall (E). This would ensure that the sample includes people who shop at all types of stores, not just clothing or shoe stores. It would also include people who shop at the mall at all times of the day and on all days of the week. The sample would not be limited to people who shop at the mall frequently enough to become registered customers or who choose to shop online. It would also not be limited to people who drive to the mall and park in the parking lot, or who choose to eat at the food court. The sample would not be biased by being conducted at a particular store or at a particular time of day.

 The Taylor polynomial for $y = f(x)$ around $x = a$ is given by
$$
T(x) = f(a) + f^{\prime}(a)(x-a) + \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f^{\prime\prime\prime}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots

 We have $(x-p)(x-q) = (r-p)(r-q)$. Expanding the left side we get $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq$. Expanding the right side we get $r^2 - (p+q)r + pq$. Hence $x^2 - (p+q)x + pq = r^2 - (p+q)r + pq$. Subtracting $pq$ from both sides we get $x^2 - (p+q)x = r^2 - (p+q)r$. Subtracting $(p+q)x$ from both sides we get $x^2 = r^2 - (p+q)r + (p+q)x$. Subtracting $(p+q)x$ from both sides we get $x^2 - (p+q)x + (p+q)^2/4 = r^2 - (p+q)r + (p+q)^2/4$. Factoring both sides we get $(x - (p+q)/2)^2 = (r - (p+q)/2)^2

 We have $ty' - 2y = t^5sin(2t) - t^3 + 4t^4$. We can rewrite this as $y' - (2 / t)y = t^4sin(2t) + t^2 - 4t^3$. The integrating factor is $e^{-2 \ln (t)}=e^{\ln (1 / t^2)}=1 / t^2$. Multiplying both sides by $1 / t^2$ we get $\left(y / t^2\right)^{\prime}=t^2sin(2t)+1-4t^2$. Integrating both sides we get $y / t^2=-\frac{1}{2} t^2cos(2t)+t-t^3+C$.

 The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used in statistics when the sample size is small. It is similar to the normal distribution, but has heavier tails, which means that there is a higher probability of extreme values. The t-distribution is also symmetric, like the normal distribution. The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing, where it is used to calculate the probability of observing a sample statistic if the null hypothesis is true. The t-distribution is also used in confidence intervals, where it is used to calculate the range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. The t-distribution is a family of distributions, with each distribution being determined by the degrees of freedom (df), which is the number of observations minus the number of parameters being estimated. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution when the sample size is large, but it is more spread out when the sample size is small.

 We use the following result:
Theorem: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices. If $G$ has no $k$-clique, then $G$ has a stable set of size $n / k$.
Proof: Let $V$ be the set of vertices of $G$. Let $S$ be a subset of $V$ of maximum size such that no two vertices in $S$ are adjacent. Then $S$ is a stable set. Let $T$ be the set of vertices in $V$ that are adjacent to all vertices in $S$. Then $T$ is a clique. If $T$ has $k$ or more vertices, then $S \cup T$ is a $k$-clique, which is a contradiction. Hence $T$ has fewer than $k$ vertices. Then $V \backslash T$ has at least $n-k+1$ vertices. Since $S$ is a stable set, $S$ is contained in $V \backslash T$. Hence $S$ has at least $n-k+1$ vertices.

 The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. The power of a test is given by $1 - \beta$, where $\beta$ is the probability of a type II error. The power of a test depends on the sample size, the significance level, and the true value of the parameter. The larger the sample size, the smaller the significance level, and the further the true value of the parameter is from the null hypothesis, the greater the power of the test. The true value of the parameter is $\mu = 65$. The null hypothesis is $H_0 : \mu = 70$. The alternative hypothesis is $H_a : \mu < 70$. The significance level is $\alpha$. The sample size is $n$. The power of the test is given by $1 - \beta = P(X < x \mid \mu = 65)$, where $x$ is the critical value. The critical value is the value of the test statistic that corresponds to the significance level. The test statistic is $Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$, where $\bar{X}$ is the sample

 We have $P(X > 12,000) = 0.7$ and $P(X > 10,000) = 0.8$. Then $P(10,000 < X \leq 12,000) = 0.8 - 0.7 = 0.1$. We have $P(X > 12,000) = P(X - 12,000 > 0) = 0.7$. Then $P(X - 12,000 > 0) = P(X - 12,000 > 2,000) = 0.7$. Hence $P(X - 12,000 \leq 0) = 0.3$. Then $P(X - 12,000 \leq 0) = P(X - 12,000 \leq 2,000) = 0.3$. Hence $P(X - 12,000 \leq 1,000) = 0.15

 Statement 1 is true. If $A$ is connected, then $A$ is not the union of two nonempty disjoint open subsets of $A$. The closure of $A$ is the union of $A$ and its limit points. If $A$ is connected, then $A$ has no limit points outside of $A$. Hence the closure of $A$ is the union of $A$ and its limit points in $A$. The closure of $A$ is not the union of two nonempty disjoint open subsets of the closure of $A$. Hence the closure of $A$ is connected.

 The function $f(x)$ is shifted $2$ units to the right and stretched vertically by a factor of $2$. This means that the function $g(x) = 2f(x-2)$ is identical to $f(x)$. Then $f(10) = g(12) = 2f(10-2) = 2f(8)$. We have $f(0) = 0.1$, hence $f(8) = f(0) + 8f’(0) = 0.1 + 8f’(0)$. We have $f(x) = f(0) + f’(0)x + o(x)$, hence $f’(0) = (f(8) - f(0))/8 = (f(8) - 0.1)/8$. Then $f(8) = 0.1 + 8(f(8) - 0.1)/8 = f(8) - 0.1 + 0.1 = f(8)$. Then $f(10) = 2f(8) = 2f(8) -

 The Müller method is a root-finding method that uses quadratic interpolation to approximate the root of a function. The method is as follows:

1. Start with three initial guesses $x_0, x_1, x_2$ and the corresponding function values $f(x_0), f(x_1), f(x_2)$.
2. Compute the coefficients $a, b, c$ of the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = a(x-x_1)(x-x_2) + b(x-x_0) + c$ that interpolates the function values at $x_0, x_1, x_2$.
3. Compute the next guess $x_3$ as the root of $p(x)$ that is closest to the previous guess $x_2$.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired accuracy is achieved.

For the given function $f(x) = x^3 - 1/2$ and the initial guesses $x_0 = 0, x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1/2$, we have $

 The P-value is the probability of observing a result as extreme as the one we observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, so the P-value is the probability of observing 60 or more heads in 100 tosses, assuming that the coin is fair. The number of heads is a binomial random variable with parameters $n = 100$ and $p = 1 / 2$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ heads is $P(k) = {100 \choose k} (1 / 2)^{100}$. The probability of observing 60 or more heads is $P(60) + P(61) + \cdots + P(100)$. We have $P(100) = {100 \choose 100} (1 / 2)^{100} = (1 / 2)^{100}$.

 The Adams-Bashforth predictor method is a numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations. The method is based on the idea of using a polynomial to approximate the solution to the differential equation at a given point, based on the values of the solution at previous points. The polynomial is chosen so that it matches the values of the solution at the previous points, and its derivative matches the derivative of the solution at the previous points. The polynomial is then used to predict the value of the solution at the next point. In this case, we are given the value of $y$ at $x=0, x=0.5, x=1, x=1.5$, and we want to find the value of $y$ at $x=2$. We can use the Adams-Bashforth predictor method to approximate the value of $y$ at $x=2$ based on the values of $y$ at $x=0, x=0.5, x=1, x=1.5$.

Then $y^{\prime}=-2 / 3 c_{1} e^{-2 x / 3}-2 / 3 c_{2} e^{-2 x / 3}+c_{2} e^{-2 x / 3}-2 / 3 c_{2} x e^{-2 x / 3}$. Then $y(0)=c_{1}=a$ and $y^{\prime}(0)=-2 / 3 c_{1}+c_{2}=-1$. Then $c_{2}=1+2 / 3 a$. Then $y=a e^{-2 x / 3}+(1+2 / 3 a) x e^{-2 x / 3}$. Then $y^{\prime}=-2 / 3 a e^{-2 x / 3}-2 / 3(

 Let $t$ denote the time in minutes. Let $T(t)$ denote the temperature of the coffee in degrees Fahrenheit at time $t$. Then $T(0)=200$. We use $T$ and $T(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $T^{\prime}$ and $T^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The temperature of the coffee decreases at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the temperature of the room. So, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $T^{\prime}(t)=-k(T(t)-70)$, where $k>0$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $T^{\prime}(t)=-k T(t)+70 k$.

 Statement 1 is true. If $f$ is a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ and $f$ is one to one, then $f(a) = f(b)$ implies $a = b$. In particular, $f(a) = f(e)$ implies $a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. Hence the kernel of $f$ consists of the identity element alone. Conversely, if the kernel of $f$ consists of the identity element alone, then $f(a) = f(b)$ implies $f(ab^{-1}) = f(e) = e$, which implies $ab^{-1} = e$, which implies $a = b$. Hence $f$ is one to one.
Statement 2 is true. The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements. For example, let $G = \mathbb{Z}_6$ and $H = \mathbb{Z}_2$. Let $f: G \to H$ be defined by $f(x) = x \mod 2$. Then $f$ is a homomorphism and the image of $G$ under $

 Let $H$ denote the percentage of patients with high blood pressure, $L$ denote the percentage of patients with low blood pressure, $R$ denote the percentage of patients with a regular heartbeat, and $I$ denote the percentage of patients with an irregular heartbeat. We are given $H=16 \%$, $L=19 \%$, and $I=17 \%$. We are also given that $35 \%$ of patients with an irregular heartbeat have high blood pressure, so $0.35 I=0.35 \cdot 17=5.95 \%$ of patients with an irregular heartbeat have high blood pressure. Since $100 \%-5.95 \%=94.05 \%$ of patients with an irregular heartbeat do not have high blood pressure, we have $R=94.05 \%$ of patients with a regular heartbeat. We are also given that $11 \%$ of patients with normal blood pressure have an irregular heartbeat, so $0.11 N=0.11 \cdot 83=9.13 \%$ of

 Let $R$ be the number of red balls in the second urn. The probability of drawing two red balls is $8 / 15 \cdot R / (R + 9)$, and the probability of drawing two blue balls is $7 / 15 \cdot 9 / (R + 9)$. The probability of drawing two balls of the same color is the sum of these probabilities, which is $151 / 300$. Hence
$$
frac{8}{15}cdotfrac{R}{R+9}+frac{7}{15}cdotfrac{9}{R+9}=frac{151}{300} .
$$
Multiplying both sides by $15(R + 9)$ gives
$$
frac{8}{1}cdot R+frac{7}{1}cdot 9=frac{151}{2}cdot 3 .

Multiplying both sides by $2 / 7$ gives

 The volume of the cylinder is $\pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the cylinder and $h$ is the height of the water. The volume of the water flowing out of the cylinder is $A v$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the outlet and $v$ is the velocity of the water flowing out of the outlet. The volume of the water flowing out of the cylinder is equal to the volume of the water flowing in, so we have $\pi r^{2} h=A v$. The velocity of the water flowing out of the outlet is $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $\pi r^{2} h=A \sqrt{2 g h}$. Squaring both sides, we get $\pi^{2} r^{4} h^{2}=2 A^{2} g h$. Simplifying, we get $h=\frac{2 A^{2} g}{\pi^{2} r^{4}}$. Substituting the given values, we get $h=\frac{2(0.

The sum of these 4 numbers is 7. We can think of this as a sequence of 3 plus signs and 4 numbers, where the $i$th number is the number of elements in the $i$th subset. For example, the sequence 2, 3, 2, 0 corresponds to the sequence + + + 2 3 2 0. The number of ways to place 3 plus signs in a sequence of 6 objects is $C(6, 3) = 20$.

The power of the engine is 400 hp, or 400 times 746 W, or 298400 W. The speed at which the engine can pull the freight cars is the power divided by the force, or 298400 W divided by 1 ton, or 298400 m/s. This is equivalent to 1080000 km/hr, or 670000 mi/hr. This is much faster than the speed of sound, so the question is unrealistic. The answer is (none of the above).

 The energy of the photon is given by E = hf = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. The momentum of the photon is given by p = E/c. The momentum of the nucleus is given by p = mv, where m is the mass of the nucleus and v is its velocity. Since the nucleus is initially at rest, the momentum of the photon is equal and opposite to the momentum of the nucleus. Thus, E/c = mv. The kinetic energy of the nucleus is given by K = 1/2 mv^2. Substituting the expression for v from the momentum equation, we get K = 1/2 (E/c)^2. The recoil energy is the kinetic energy of the nucleus, which is given by E\_recoil = 1/2 (E/c)^2. Substituting the expression for E in terms of λ, we get E\_recoil = 1/2 (hc/λ)^2 / c^2 = h^2c

a) The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by $C = \epsilon A/d$, where $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium between the plates, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the distance between the plates. In this case, the permittivity is that of vacuum, $\epsilon_0$, and the distance is 5 mm or 0.005 m.

 The fraction of alpha particles deflected at an angle of 90° or more is the fraction of alpha particles that have a change in momentum of at least 2 times the initial momentum. The change in momentum is given by the product of the mass of the alpha particle, the initial velocity, and the change in velocity. The change in velocity is given by the product of the acceleration and the time. The acceleration is given by the product of the electric charge of the alpha particle, the electric field of the gold nucleus, and the distance between the alpha particle and the gold nucleus.

 The clown catches and throws each ball in 0.9 seconds, so the minimum time the ball is in the air is 0.9 seconds. The minimum vertical speed is the distance divided by the time, or the height of the throw divided by the time. The height of the throw is the maximum height the ball reaches, which is the same as the height of the clown's hand. The height of the clown's hand is the same as the radius of the circle the ball traces out, which is the circumference of the circle divided by 2π. The circumference of the circle is the distance the ball travels in one cycle, which is the speed of the ball times the time. The speed of the ball is the minimum vertical speed we are trying to find. So we have a formula for the minimum vertical speed in terms of the minimum vertical speed, which is $v = \pi r/t = \pi d/2t = \pi d/2 \cdot v/d = \pi v/2$.

 The distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite is the sum of the Earth's radius and the height of the satellite above the Earth's surface. The Earth's radius is about 6370 km. The height of the satellite above the Earth's surface is the average of the perigee and apogee heights, which is (300 km + 3500 km)/2 = 1900 km. The distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite is thus 6370 km + 1900 km = 8270 km. The satellite rotates 90 degrees around the Earth in 1/4 of an orbit. The distance the satellite travels in 1/4 of an orbit is 1/4 of the circumference of the orbit. The circumference of a circle is 2π times the radius. The radius of the orbit is the distance from the center of the Earth to the satellite, which is 8270 km.

 The potential energy of a particle in a central inverse-square-law force field is given by $U = - \frac{k}{r}$ where $k$ is the force constant and $r$ is the distance from the center of the field.

 The electric field $E$ is related to the charge density $\rho$ by Gauss's law, which states that the flux of the electric field through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity of free space $\varepsilon_0$. The flux is the integral of the electric field over the surface, and the charge enclosed is the integral of the charge density over the volume enclosed by the surface. The electric field is given by $E=K r^4$, and the surface area of a sphere is $4 \pi r^2$. The flux is then $4 \pi r^2 K r^4 = 4 \pi K r^6$. The charge enclosed is the integral of the charge density over the volume, which is $4 \pi r^2$ times the integral of the charge density over $r$. The charge enclosed is then $4 \pi r^2$ times the integral of $\rho r^2 dr$. The integral of $\rho r^2 dr$ is the charge density times $r^3/3$, so the charge enclosed is $4 \pi r^2 \rho r^3/3 = 4 \pi \rho r

In this case, the two events occur at the same place in the reference frame in which the two events are separated by a distance of 0 m.

 The force on the drop due to the electric field is $qE$, where $q$ is the charge on the drop and $E$ is the electric field. The force on the drop due to gravity is $mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the drop and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. When the drop is suspended, these forces balance, so $qE = mg$. The mass of the drop is its volume times its density, or $(4/3) \pi r^3 \rho$, where $r$ is the radius of the drop and $\rho$ is its density. Substituting this into the force balance equation, we get $qE = (4/3) \pi r^3 \rho g$. Solving for $q$, we get $q = (4/3) \pi r^3 \rho g / E$.

 The image of the light bulb is formed by the ball bearing acting as a lens. The image distance is given by the lens equation $1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i$, where $f$ is the focal length of the ball bearing, $d_o$ is the object distance, and $d_i$ is the image distance. The focal length of a spherical ball bearing is given by $f = r/(n-1)$, where $r$ is the radius of the ball bearing and $n$ is the index of refraction of the ball bearing. The radius of the ball bearing is 0.5 inches, and the index of refraction of steel is about 2.5. So the focal length of the ball bearing is 0.5/(2.5-1) = 0.5/1.5 = 1/3 inches.

 Gauss' Law states that the net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the charge enclosed by the surface. In this case, the electric field is due to the mass of the earth, and the closed surface is a sphere centered on the mass. The mass of the earth below the sphere is proportional to the volume of the sphere, which is proportional to the cube of the radius. The force on the mass is proportional to the mass of the earth below the sphere, and thus to the cube of the radius. The radius of the earth is about 6400 km, so the force at a depth of 1/4 of the radius is 1/64 of the force at the surface, and the force at a depth of 1/2 of the radius is 1/256 of the force at the surface. The force at the surface is the mass of the earth times the acceleration due to gravity, or about 6 x 10^24 kg x 10 m/s^2, or 6 x 10^25 Newton's.

 The chain is unwinding from the spool, so the length of chain that has fallen is equal to the length of chain that is unwound from the spool. The length of chain that has fallen is $y$, and the length of chain that is unwound is $l + y$ (the $l$ is because the chain is unwound from the spool, and the $y$ is because the chain that has fallen is also part of the chain that is unwound). The length of chain that has fallen is also equal to the length of chain that is unwound, so $y = (l + y) \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle of the unwound chain with the horizontal. The angle of the unwound chain with the horizontal is the same as the angle of the plane with the horizontal, so $\theta = \tan^{-1} (l / y)$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $y = (l + y) \tan^{-1} (l / y)$.

The gravitational force is $GMm/r^2$, where $M$ is the mass of Mars, $m$ is the mass of the spaceship, and $r$ is the distance from the center of Mars to the spaceship. The centripetal force is $mv^2/r$, where $v$ is the velocity of the spaceship. Setting these equal to each other, we find that $v^2 = GM/r$. The missile must have at least this velocity to reach the spaceship. The escape velocity is $v_{esc} = \sqrt{2GM/r}$, which is the velocity required to escape Mars's gravitational field.

 The force on a charge q due to a charge Q is given by $F = k q Q / r^2$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $q$ is the charge, $Q$ is the charge of the other object, and $r$ is the distance between the charges. The force on $q_3$ due to $q_1$ is $k q_1 q_3 / (1 m)^2$, and the force on $q_3$ due to $q_2$ is $k q_2 q_3 / (1 m)^2$. Since $q_1$ and $q_2$ are equal and opposite, the forces on $q_3$ are equal and opposite, and thus the net force is the sum of the two forces. The net force is $k (q_1 + q_2) q_3 / (1 m)^2$, or $k (50 \mu C - 25 \mu C) (20 \mu C) / (1 m)^2$, or $k (25 \mu C) (20 \mu C) / (1 m)^2$, or $k (

 The charge on one electron is $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~C}$ and there are $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ electrons in one mole of a substance.

 The reflectance is given by the Fresnel equation, which is $R = (n_1 - n_2)^2/(n_1 + n_2)^2$ for normal incidence. For crown glass, this is $(1.523 - 1.33)^2/(1.523 + 1.33)^2 = 0.044$, or 4.4%. For flint glass, this is $(1.62 - 1.33)^2/(1.62 + 1.33)^2 = 0.094$, or 9.4%. However, the question asks for the reflectance at a water-glass boundary, so we need to use the refractive index of water, which is 1.33. Thus, the reflectance for crown glass is $(1.523 - 1.33)^2/(1.523 + 1.33)^2 = 0.044$, or 4.4%, and for flint glass is $(1.62 - 1.33)^2/(1.62 + 1.33

 The magnetic force on a moving charge is given by $q \vec{v} \times \vec{B}$, where $q$ is the charge, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field. Since the particle is moving at right angles to the magnetic field, the force is given by $q v B$, where $v$ is the speed. The particle is not accelerating in the horizontal direction, so the magnetic force must be balanced by the centrifugal force, which is given by $m v^2 / r$, where $m$ is the mass and $r$ is the radius of curvature. Setting these two forces equal to each other, we find that $q v B = m v^2 / r$. Solving for $m$, we find that $m = q B r / v$. The radius of curvature is given by $v^2 / r = a$, where $a$ is the acceleration due to the magnetic force. Substituting this into the previous equation, we find that $m = q B^2 / a$.

 The number of fringes is proportional to the difference in the optical path length between the two tubes. The optical path length is the product of the physical path length and the index of refraction. Since the physical path length is the same in both tubes, the difference in the optical path length is the difference in the index of refraction times the physical path length. The difference in the index of refraction is the index of refraction of the air in the first tube minus the index of refraction of the air in the second tube. Since the second tube is evacuated, the index of refraction of the air in the second tube is 1. The index of refraction of the air in the first tube is the index of refraction of the air at the given temperature and pressure. The difference in the index of refraction is thus the index of refraction of the air at the given temperature and pressure minus 1. The physical path length is 20 cm. The number of fringes is 98. The difference in the index of refraction is thus 98 times the physical path length divided by the product of the speed of light and the number of fringes, or 98 times

 The buoyant force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. Since the weight of a fluid is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, and the mass of a fluid is equal to its volume times its density, the buoyant force is equal to the volume of the object times the density of the fluid. The volume of the object is equal to its mass divided by its density, so the buoyant force is equal to the mass of the object times the density of the fluid divided by the density of the object. If the object is completely submerged, the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the object, so the weight of the object is equal to the mass of the object times the density of the fluid divided by the density of the object. Since the weight of the object is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, the density of the object is equal to the density of the fluid divided by the acceleration due to gravity.

 Since the rope is light, it doesn't contribute to the motion. The motion of James and Ramon is due to the tension in the rope, which is the same for both. The tension is the force that pulls them together, and it is given by the change in momentum divided by the time. Since the mass of James is 90 kg and he moves 6 m, his momentum change is 90 kg times 6 m, or 540 kg m/s. Since the time is the distance divided by the speed, the time is 20 m divided by the speed of the rope, which is the same as the speed of James, or 6 m/s. So the time is 20 m / 6 m/s = 10/3 s. The tension is then 540 kg m/s divided by 10/3 s, or 162 kg m/s^2. Since the mass of Ramon is 60 kg, the force on him is 162 kg m/s^2, and the distance he moves is the force divided by his mass, or 162 kg m/s^2 divided by 6

 The kinetic energy of a rolling object is the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy. The translational kinetic energy is given by $1/2 m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the object and $v$ is its velocity. The rotational kinetic energy is given by $1/2 I \omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the object and $\omega$ is its angular velocity. For a solid disk, the moment of inertia is $1/2 m r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the disk. Since the disk is rolling without slipping, the linear velocity $v$ is related to the angular velocity $\omega$ by $v = \omega r$. Thus, the rotational kinetic energy is $1/4 m v^2$, and the total kinetic energy is $3/4 m v^2$. The fraction of the total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is thus $1/4 m v^2 / (3/4 m v^2) = 1/3$. The answer is (

 (a) The ball is thrown upward with an initial speed $v_0$ and falls back to the ground with a final speed $v_f$. The time it takes to reach the top of its trajectory is half the total time, or 5 seconds. The distance to the top is given by $d = v_0 t - g t^2/2$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. At the top, the ball is momentarily at rest, so $v_0 = g t$. Substituting this into the distance equation, we find $d = g t^2/2$. The time it takes to fall back to the ground is another 5 seconds, so the total time is 10 seconds. The distance to the ground is $d = g t^2/2$, where $t$ is the total time. The initial speed is $v_0 = g t/2$. Substituting this into the distance equation, we find $d = v_0 t - g t^2/4$. The initial speed is thus $v_0 = 2 d/t = 2 g t/4 = g t/2 = 10

The x-velocity is given by v_x = 2.0 t - (0.05) t^2 + C_1, where C_1 is a constant of integration. The x-position is given by x = t^2 - (0.017) t^3 + C_1 t + C_2, where C_2 is another constant of integration. The maximum x-velocity occurs when the x-acceleration is zero, which occurs at t = 20 s. At this time, the x-velocity is 2.0 * 20 - (0.05) * 20^2 = 300 m/s. The x-position at this time is 20^2 - (0.017) * 20^

 The rocket will lift off when the net force on it is nonzero. The net force is the force of the engines minus the force of gravity. The force of the engines is the mass flow rate times the exhaust velocity, or 250 kg/s times 2500 m/s, or 625000 N. The force of gravity is the mass times the acceleration due to gravity, or 70000 kg times 9.8 m/s^2, or 686000 N. The net force is thus negative, or 625000 N minus 686000 N, or -61000 N. This means the rocket is actually being pushed down into the ground. The answer is that the design is wrong.

 (a) The time between eclipses is the time it takes for the wheel to rotate one tooth width, which is the circumference of the wheel divided by the number of teeth. The circumference is $2 \pi R$, where $R$ is the radius of the wheel. The time between eclipses is then $2 \pi R / v$, where $v$ is the angular velocity of the wheel. The distance the light travels in this time is $c t$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, $c t = 2 \pi R / v$, or $c = 2 \pi R v / (2 \pi R) = v / t$. The time $t$ is the time it takes for the wheel to rotate one tooth width, which is the circumference of the wheel divided by the number of teeth times the angular velocity of the wheel. Thus, $t = 2 \pi R / (600 v)$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get $c = v / (2 \pi R / (600 v)) = 600 v^2 / (2 \pi R)$. Substituting

 The first polarizer will pass a fraction of the incident light, and the last polarizer will pass a fraction of the light that made it through the first polarizer. The fraction passed by each polarizer is the cosine of the angle between the polarization axis and the transmission axis. Since the angle between the transmission axes of the polarizers is (\pi / 2) - (\pi / 4N), the fraction of light passed is cos((\pi / 2) - (\pi / 4N)) = sin(\pi / 4N). Since the number of half-wave plates is (2N - 1), the total fraction of light passed is sin^(2N - 1)(\pi / 4N). Since sin(x) is approximately x for small x, the fraction of light passed is approximately ((\pi / 4N) / (4N))^(2N - 1) = ((\pi / 16N^2))^(2N - 1).

 After the collision, the velocities of the two particles are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2=\alpha \mathbf{u}_1$. By conservation of momentum, $m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2 = m_1 \mathbf{u}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{u}_2$. Since $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, $\mathbf{v}_1 = 0$. Since the initial kinetic energies are equal, $m_1 u_1^2 = m_2 u_2^2$. Since $\alpha$ is positive, $u_2 = \alpha u_1$. Substituting these into the conservation of momentum equation, we get $m_2 \alpha u_1 = m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_1$. Dividing both sides by $m_1 u_1$, we get $\alpha = 1 + m_2 / m_1$.

The velocity at which the parachutist is at 0.95$v_t$ is $0.95 \times 19.6 m/s = 18.52 m/s$. The distance traveled is given by the integral of the velocity with respect to time, which is $h = \int_0^t v dt$. Since the velocity is changing linearly with time, this is just $h = vt/2$. The time it takes to reach 18.52 m/s is $t = (18.52 m/s - 0 m/s) / 9.8 m

 a) The true power of the combination is the sum of the powers of the two lenses, or 5 diopters + 8 diopters = 13 diopters. b) The true focal length is the reciprocal of the true power, or 1/13 diopters = 7.7 cm. c) The principal points are the points where the optical axis of the lens intersects the lens. The first principal point is 12.5 mm in front of the first lens, or 7.5 cm from the center of the combination. The second principal point is 0 mm in front of the second lens, or 8 cm from the center of the combination. d) The posterior focal point of the combination is the point where the optical axis intersects the focal plane of the combination. It is 1/13 diopters = 7.7 cm behind the second lens, or 15.7 cm from the center of the combination. The anterior focal point of the first lens is 1/5 diopters = 20 cm in front of the first lens, or 32.5 cm from the center of the combination

 The mirror equation is $1/f = 1/p + 1/q$, where $f$ is the focal length, $p$ is the object distance, and $q$ is the image distance. The magnification is $M = -q/p$. The focal length is $f = R/2 = 2$ feet. The object distance is $p = 1$ foot. Solving for the image distance, we find $q = -2$ feet. The magnification is $M = -q/p = 2$. If the object moves 1 inch closer, the new object distance is $p = 1$ foot - 1 inch = 11/12 feet. The new image distance is $q = -2f \times p/(p-f) = -2 \times 2 \times 11/12 / (11/12 - 2) = -2 \times 2 \times 11/12 / (-1/12) = -2 \times 2 \times 11 = -44$ feet. The new image distance is 44 feet away from the mirror. The displacement

 a) The net rate of heat loss from the warmer surface is given by the difference in the power radiated by the two surfaces. The power radiated by a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma T^4$, where $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The power radiated by the warmer surface is $P_1 = \sigma (300 K)^4 = 1310.72 W/m^2$, and the power radiated by the cooler surface is $P_2 = \sigma (200 K)^4 = 321.12 W/m^2$. The net rate of heat loss is $P_1 - P_2 = 989.6 W/m^2$. b) The temperature of the aluminum foil is given by the equation $P_1 = P_2 + P_3$, where $P_3$ is the power radiated by the foil. The foil is a graybody, so the power radiated by the foil is $P_3 = \epsilon

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. The formula for skewness is:

skewness = (mean - median) / standard deviation

The mean is:

(6*49 + 15*55 + 24*61 + 33*67 + 22*73) / (6 + 15 + 24 + 33 + 22) = 64.2

The median is the 25th value, which is 61.

The standard deviation is:

sqrt((6*(49-64.2)^2 + 15*(55-64.2)^2 + 24*(61-64.2)^2 + 33*(67-64.2)^2 + 22*(73-64.2)^2) / (6 + 15 + 24 + 33 + 22)) = 5.4

The skewness is:

(64.2 - 61) / 5.4 = 0.58
