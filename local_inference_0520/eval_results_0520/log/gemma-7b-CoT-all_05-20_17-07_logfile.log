 Heritability is the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is due to genetic variance. The heritability of a trait is a measure of the extent to which the variation in a trait is due to genetic differences between individuals. The heritability of a trait is a number between 0 and 1. The higher the heritability of a trait, the more the trait is influenced by genetic factors. The lower the heritability of a trait, the more the trait is influenced by environmental factors. The heritability of a trait can be estimated by the formula $h^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_P}$, where $V_G$ is the genetic variance and $V_P$ is the phenotypic variance. The phenotypic variance is the sum of the genetic variance and the environmental variance. The heritability of a trait can be estimated by the formula $h^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_P} = \frac{V_G}{V_G + V_E}$, where $V_E$ is the environmental variance. The heritability of a trait can be estimated by the formula $h^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_G + V_E} = \frac{\sigma_G

 Programmed cell death (PCD) is a form of cell death that is highly regulated and is an important part of normal development in many organisms. In plants, PCD is involved in the development of many structures, including the formation of the root cap, the formation of the stomatal guard cells, and the formation of the xylem and phloem vessels. The root cap is a protective layer of cells that covers the root tip and is involved in the growth of the root. The root cap is made up of a single layer of cells that are constantly being produced and replaced. As the root grows, the cells at the tip of the root cap are pushed out of the way and are eventually replaced by new cells.

 The lac operon is a group of three genes in the E. coli bacterium that are involved in the metabolism of lactose. The genes are called lacZ, lacY, and lacA. The lacZ gene codes for the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. The lacY gene codes for the enzyme permease, which helps to transport lactose into the cell. The lacA gene codes for the enzyme transacetylase, which is involved in the metabolism of galactose. The lac operon is controlled by a regulatory gene called lacI. The lacI gene codes for a repressor protein that binds to the operator region of the lac operon and prevents the transcription of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes. The presence of lactose in the cell environment can cause the repressor protein to be inactivated, allowing the transcription of the lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes. The inducer molecule is allolactose, which is a derivative of lactose. It is produced by the action of beta-galactosidase on lactose.

 The immune system is a complex system of cells and proteins that work together to protect the body from foreign invaders. The immune system is divided into two main parts: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the first line of defense against foreign invaders. It is a non-specific system that is always on and ready to respond to any type of invader. The adaptive immune system is a more specific system that is activated when the body is exposed to a specific invader. The adaptive immune system is made up of two types of cells: B cells and T cells. B cells are responsible for making antibodies, which are proteins that can bind to specific foreign invaders and mark them for destruction. T cells are responsible for killing cells that have been infected with a foreign invader. T cells can also help to activate other parts of the immune system. T cells are also responsible for the process of tissue graft rejection. When a tissue graft is transplanted into a person, the T cells in the recipient's body will recognize the graft as foreign and will try to destroy it. This is because the T cells in the recipient's body have been exposed to the antigens on the surface of the graft and have been programmed to recognize and destroy them. The process of tissue graft

 The genetic code is a set of rules that defines the relationship between the sequence of nucleotides in a gene and the sequence of amino acids in the protein it encodes. The genetic code is universal, meaning that all living things use the same genetic code. The genetic code is also degenerate, meaning that more than one triplet of nucleotides can code for a given amino acid. The genetic code is also non-overlapping, meaning that each nucleotide triplet codes for a single amino acid. The genetic code is also non-ambiguous, meaning that each amino acid is coded for by a unique triplet of nucleotides. The genetic code is also co-linear, meaning that the order of nucleotides in a gene is the same as the order of amino acids in the protein it encodes. The genetic code is also non-punctuated, meaning that the start and stop signals are not encoded by a particular nucleotide triplet. The genetic code is also read in a continuous fashion, meaning that the code is read from the 5' end to the 3' end of the gene. The genetic code is also read in a non-overlapping fashion, meaning that each nucleotide triplet is read as a single unit and is not read in overlapping fashion.

 Translocation is the movement of nutrients from the leaves to other parts of the plant body. The pressure-flow theory is the most widely accepted theory of translocation. It states that the movement of water and solutes in the phloem is due to a pressure gradient that is created by the active transport of solutes into the phloem at the source. The auxin transport theory states that auxin is the primary factor that controls the direction of phloem flow. The electric potential gradient theory states that the movement of water and solutes in the phloem is due to an electric potential gradient that is created by the active transport of solutes into the phloem at the source.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on interest for help. The constant ratio formula is used to calculate the interest rate of a loan. The formula is:
$$
\text{Interest rate} = \frac{\text{Total interest}}{\text{Principal}}
$$
The total interest is the difference between the total amount paid and the principal. The principal is the amount of the loan. The total amount paid is the sum of the down payment and the monthly payments. The down payment is the amount of the old car. The monthly payments are the amount of the loan. The total amount paid is:
$$
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Down payment} + \text{Monthly payments} \times \text{Number of months}
$$
The number of months is the number of equal monthly payments. The total amount paid is:
$$
\text{Total amount paid} = 500 + 180 \times 25 = 500 + 4500 = 5000

$$
I
$$
is the interest,
$$
P
$$
is the principal (or the amount of the loan),

is the time (in years).
In this case, the principal is $720, the time is 18 months, and the interest is $47.20. We can use the formula to find the annual interest rate:
$$
I = P \times r \times t
$$
$$
47.20 = 720 \times r \times \frac{18}{12}

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on depreciation for help. The sum-of-the-years'-digits method is a method of calculating depreciation. The formula for the sum-of-the-years'-digits method is:
$$ \text{Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage value}}{\text{Sum of the years digits}} \times \text{Number of years in service}$$
The sum of the years digits is:
$$ \text{Sum of the years digits} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$
where $n$ is the number of years in service.
The sum of the years digits is:
$$ \text{Sum of the years digits} = \frac{35(35 + 1)}{2} = 610$$

One option is to rent it for $130 per month over the three years. The deal includes the fuel needed to operate the equipment. The other option is to buy the equipment now and sell it after three years. The machinery costs $11,500. There is a down payment of $2,500, so that the balance due will be $11,500 - $2,500 = $9,000. This balance will be covered by a 5(1/2)% loan to be paid in equal annual installments over 15 years. The annual fuel costs for the equipment would be $375. If the minimum attractive rate of return is 5%, at what resale value (end of third year) will both options be equally economical? Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

 We have a weak acid and a strong base. The strong base will react with the weak acid to form water and a salt. The salt will be a weak base. The pH of the solution will be determined by the weak base. The concentration of the weak base is equal to the concentration of the strong base, which is 0.0023 M. The pH of a weak base is equal to $pOH = -log([OH^{-}])$. The $pOH$ is equal to $14 - pH$. The $pH$ is therefore equal to $14 - (-log([OH^{-}])) = 14 + log([OH^{-}])$. The $pOH$ is equal to $14 - pH = 14 - (14 + log([OH^{-}])) = -log([OH^{-}])$. The $pH$ is therefore equal to $14 + log([OH^{-}])$. The $OH^{-}$ concentration is equal to $10^{-pOH} = 10^{-(-log([OH^{-}]))} = [OH^{-}]$. The $pH$ is therefore equal to $14 + log([OH^{-}]) = 14 + log([0.0023])

 The change in internal energy is equal to the change in enthalpy minus the work done by the system. The work done by the system is equal to the change in pressure times the change in volume. The change in pressure is equal to the change in the number of moles of gas times the gas constant times the change in temperature. The change in the number of moles of gas is equal to the number of moles of gas in the products minus the number of moles of gas in the reactants. The number of moles of gas in the products is equal to 2 + 3 = 5 and the number of moles of gas in the reactants is equal to 0 + 3 = 3. Therefore the change in the number of moles of gas is equal to 5 - 3 = 2. The change in temperature is equal to 0 K. The gas constant is equal to 8.314 J/mol K. The change in pressure is therefore equal to 2 * 8.314 * 0 = 0 J/mol. The work done by the system is therefore equal to 0 J/mol.

 The mass of a fluorine atom is equal to the sum of the mass of the protons and the mass of the electrons. The mass of the nucleus is equal to the mass of the protons. Therefore the mass of the electrons is equal to the difference between the mass of the atom and the mass of the nucleus. The mass of the electrons is therefore equal to $9 \cdot 0.000549 - 9 \cdot 1.00728 = -0.001011$. The mass of the nucleus is therefore equal to $9 \cdot 1.00728 = 9.06552$.

 The mole fraction of O2 is equal to the number of moles of O2 divided by the total number of moles of all species. The total number of moles is equal to the sum of the number of moles of SO2, SO3, and O2. The number of moles of SO2 is equal to 0.100 - 2x, where x is the number of moles of SO2 that have reacted to form SO3. The number of moles of SO3 is equal to 0.100 + 2x. The number of moles of O2 is equal to 0.100 - x. The total number of moles is therefore equal to $0.100 - 2x + 0.100 + 2x + 0.100 - x = 0.300 - x$. The mole fraction of O2 is therefore equal to $

 The first thing to do is to determine the amount of K in the sample. We know that the sample is 3 percent K, so we have 0.03 kg of K in the sample. We also know that the percent abundance of ^40K is 0.0118. Therefore the amount of ^40K in the sample is 0.0118 kg. We can now determine the amount of ^40Ar in the sample. We know that the ratio of ^40Ar to ^36Ar is 75,200. Therefore the amount of ^36Ar in the sample is 95.0 × 10^-7 / 75,200 = 1.26 × 10^-9 m^3.

 The pressure in the tire is equal to the sum of the gauge pressure and the atmospheric pressure. The gauge pressure is equal to the difference between the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure. Therefore the actual pressure is equal to the sum of the gauge pressure and the atmospheric pressure. The actual pressure in the tire in the winter is therefore $30 + 15 = 45$ psi. The actual pressure in the summer is equal to the actual pressure in the winter plus the change in pressure. The change in pressure is equal to the change in temperature times the initial pressure times the ratio of the final and initial volumes. The change in temperature is equal to the final temperature minus the initial temperature. The initial temperature is 0°C, or 273 K. The final temperature is 50°C, or 323 K. The initial volume is equal to the final volume. The change in pressure is therefore equal to $323 - 273 = 50$ K times $45$ psi times $

 The degree of dissociation is the fraction of the original amount of the substance that is dissociated. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the two gases. The partial pressure of the nitrogen tetroxide is equal to the original pressure of the gas, which is 1 atm. The partial pressure of the nitrogen dioxide is equal to the degree of dissociation times the original pressure of the gas. Therefore the total pressure is equal to $1 + \alpha$. The total number of moles of gas is equal to the number of moles of the original gas plus the number of moles of the new gas. The number of moles of the original gas is equal to the mass of the gas divided by the molar mass of the gas. The number of moles of the new gas is equal to the degree of dissociation times the number of moles of the original gas. Therefore the total number of moles of gas is equal to $

 The first thing to do is to calculate the change in volume. The volume of 1 mole of liquid is $0.02345 \cdot 18.00 = 0.4211$ ft$^3$. The volume of 1 mole of gas is $18.00 \cdot 18.00 = 324$ ft$^3$. The change in volume is therefore $324 - 0.4211 = 323.5789$ ft$^3$. The change in volume is positive because the gas is expanding. The work done is $w = -P \Delta V = -1 \cdot 14.7 \cdot 323.5789 = -471.11$ ft-lb. The work is negative because the gas is expanding.

 The rate of effusion is given by the equation $$\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{PA}{RT},$$ where $P$ is the pressure, $A$ is the area of the hole, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The rate of effusion is the number of molecules that effuse per unit time. The rate of effusion is also the number of molecules that effuse per unit time divided by the number of molecules in the system. Therefore the rate of effusion is equal to $$\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{N}{t}.$$ The number of molecules in the system is equal to the number of moles in the system times the Avogadro number. The number of moles in the system is equal to the mass of the system divided by the molar mass of the system. Therefore the number of molecules in the system is equal to $$\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{m}{M} \cdot \frac{N_{A}}{t}.$$ The rate of effusion is equal to the rate of effusion per unit time times the molar mass of the system. Therefore the rate of effusion is equal to $$\frac{dN}{dt}

We can do this by using the equation $q = mc \Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the benzoic acid, $c$ is the specific heat of the calorimeter, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. The specific heat of the calorimeter is not given, but we can assume that it is the same as the specific heat of water, which is $4.18 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~g}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$. Therefore, $q = 0.825 \mathrm{~g} \cdot 4.18 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~g}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \cdot 1.940 \mathrm{~K} = 6.91 \mathrm{~J}$.

 We will use the heat equation to solve this problem. The heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the ice. $Q_{water} = -Q_{ice}$. The heat lost by the water is equal to the mass of the water times the specific heat of water times the change in temperature. $Q_{water} = m_{water} \cdot c_{water} \cdot \Delta T_{water}$. The heat gained by the ice is equal to the mass of the ice times the specific heat of ice times the change in temperature. $Q_{ice} = m_{ice} \cdot c_{ice} \cdot \Delta T_{ice}$.

 The vapor pressure of a solution is given by the following equation: $P_{solution} = x_{solvent} \cdot P_{solvent}$. The mole fraction of the solvent is given by $x_{solvent} = $
rac{n_{solvent}}{n_{total}} = $
rac{53.0}{53.0 + 3.68}. The vapor pressure of the solution is given as 615 torr. The vapor pressure of the pure solvent is given as 640 torr. Therefore we have $615 = $

 The freezing point depression is given by $\Delta T = K_{f} \cdot m$, where $m$ is the molality of the solution. The molality is equal to the number of moles of solute divided by the number of moles of solvent. The number of moles of solvent is equal to the mass of the solvent divided by the molar mass of the solvent. The molar mass of benzene is 78 g/mol. The number of moles of solvent is therefore $150 \cdot 
rac{1}{78} = 1.92$ moles. The number of moles of solute is $25.1 \cdot 
rac{1}{m}$. The molality is therefore $1.92 \cdot m =

For example, the solubility product of $Fe(OH)_{2}$ is equal to $10^{-17} = [Fe^{2+}][OH^{-}]^{2}$. The $OH^{-}$ concentration is equal to the $pOH = 14 - pH$. Therefore we have $10^{-17} = [Fe^{2+}][10^{-14 + pH}]^{2}$. We can solve for the $pH$ to get $pH = 14 - 2 \cdot log_{10}(10^{-17}) = 14 - 2 \cdot 17 = 14 - 34 = -20$. This is not a valid answer because the $pH$ must be between 0 and 14. Therefore we have $pH = 14 - 2 \cdot log_{10}(10^{-17}) = 14 - 2 \cdot 17 = 14 - 34 = -20$.

 The heat lost by the iron is equal to the heat gained by the water. We can write this as $q_{iron} = -q_{water}$. The heat lost by the iron is equal to the mass of the iron times the specific heat of iron times the change in temperature. The heat gained by the water is equal to the mass of the water times the specific heat of water times the change in temperature. We can write this as $q_{iron} = m_{iron} \cdot c_{iron} \cdot \Delta T_{iron}$ and $q_{water} = m_{water} \cdot c_{water} \cdot \Delta T_{water}$. The change in temperature is equal to the final temperature minus the initial temperature. We can write this as $\Delta T_{iron} = T_{final} - T_{initial}$ and $\Delta T_{water} = T_{final} - T_{initial}$. We can substitute these into the heat equation to get $m_{iron} \cdot c_{iron} \cdot (T_{final} - T_{initial}) = -m_{water} \cdot c_{water} \cdot (T_{final} - T_{initial})$. We can then solve for the final temperature

 We can use the following formula to compute the mutual information between $X$ and $Z$:
$I(X;Z) = H(X) - H(X|Z)$
We can compute the entropy of $X$ as follows:
$H(X) = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x)} = \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x)} = \log_2 \frac{1}{0.1} = 2.32$
We can compute the conditional entropy of $X$ given $Z$ as follows:
$H(X|Z) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} p(z) H(X|Z=z) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} p(z) \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x|z) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x|z)} = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} p(z) \log_2 \frac{1}{p(x|z)} = \log_2

 We can see that T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n), so T(n + 1) = 3n + 3n - 1 + T(n - 1), so T(n + 1) = 6n - 1 + T(n - 1).
We can see that T(n + 1) = 6n - 1 + T(n - 1), so T(n + 1) = 6n - 1 + 6n - 2 + T(n - 2), so T(n + 1) = 12n - 3 + T(n - 2).

 The cache is direct-mapped with a block size of 8 bytes. The cache is 2K bytes, so it has 256 blocks. The cache is physically addressed and physically tagged, so the cache is indexed by the low-order 8 bits of the physical address and the tag is the high-order bits of the physical address.
The first element of A is at physical address 4,096. The first element of B is at physical address 8,192. The first element of A is in block 0 of the cache and the first element of B is in block 1 of the cache.
The loop iterates 256 times. On the first iteration, the cache is empty, so the first element of A is read from memory and the first element of B is read from memory. The first element of A is written to the cache and the first element of B is written to the cache.

 The OSI model is a model that describes the functions of a telecommunication or computer networking system. It is a conceptual model that facilitates the explanation of how different parts of a networking system work together. The model is divided into seven layers, each of which is responsible for a specific function. The seven layers are:
Physical layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission of raw data bits over a network. It is the lowest layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the physical connection between devices.
Data link layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission of data frames over a network. It is the second layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the physical addressing of devices.
Network layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission of data packets over a network. It is the third layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the logical addressing of devices.
Transport layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission of data segments over a network. It is the fourth layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data.
Session layer: This layer is responsible for the establishment, management, and termination of a session between two devices. It is the fifth layer in the OSI model and is responsible for the coordination of data

Dividend = (Retained earnings + Net income) * (1 - tax rate)
We know that the retained earnings are $100,000 and the net income is $1,000,000. The tax rate is 48 percent. Thus, we have:
Dividend = ($100,000 + $1,000,000) * (1 - 0.48) = $1,100,000 * (1 - 0.48) = $1,100,000 * 0.52 = $572,000
If the tax rate fell to 45 percent, then the dividend would be:
Dividend = ($100,000 + $1,000,000) * (1 - 0.45) = $1,100,000 * (1 - 0.45) = $1,10

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on econometrics for help. The Durbin Watson test is a test for the presence of serial correlation in the error term of a regression model. The test statistic is a measure of the correlation between the error terms in the model. The test statistic is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the first and last residuals in the model divided by the sum of the absolute values of all the residuals in the model. The test statistic is compared to a critical value to determine whether the null hypothesis of no serial correlation is rejected. The critical value depends on the number of observations in the model and the number of explanatory variables in the model. If the test statistic is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis of no serial correlation is rejected and the presence of serial correlation is indicated. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis of no serial correlation is not rejected and the presence of serial correlation is not indicated. If the test statistic is equal to the critical value, the test result is inconclusive. In this case, the test statistic is 1.53, which is less than the critical value of 1.55 for 50 data points and 2 explanatory variables. Therefore, the null hypothesis of no serial

Over-simplification and over-reliance
The use of models is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, models are useful in that they allow us to simplify complex problems and to focus on the most important factors. On the other hand, models can be oversimplified and over-relied upon. This can lead to a false sense of security and can result in incorrect predictions.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity demanded to the percentage change in the price. The formula for the elasticity of demand is:
elasticity of demand = (percentage change in quantity demanded) / (percentage change in price)
The percentage change in quantity demanded is:
percentage change in quantity demanded = (change in quantity demanded) / (original quantity demanded)
The percentage change in price is:
percentage change in price = (change in price) / (original price)
The change in quantity demanded is 110 - 100 = 10. The original quantity demanded is 100. The change in price is 20 - 25 = -5. The original price is 25. Thus, we have:
percentage change in quantity demanded = (10) / (100) = 1 / 10 = 0.1
percentage change in price = (-5) / (25) = -1 / 5 = -0.2
The elasticity of demand is:

For B, MU_B = 21 - 2y, where y is the number of units of B produced. We know that David Jones has $7 to spend. We can use the following formula to solve the problem:
MU_A / price of A = MU_B / price of B
We can plug in the numbers to get the following:
(10 - x) / 1 = (21 - 2y) / 1

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on finance for help. The bill rate is the interest rate on a bill. The coupon issue yield is the yield on a bill. The bill rate is calculated as the following:
bill rate = (100 - price) / (price * number of days to maturity / 360)
The price is $ 97,987. The number of days to maturity is 91. Thus, we have:
bill rate = (100 - 97,987) / (97,987 * 91 / 360) = 0.0233 = 2.33 percent.
The coupon issue yield is calculated as the following:
coupon issue yield = (100 - price) / (price * number of days to maturity / 360) + (coupon rate / 100)
The coupon rate is 8.24 percent. Thus, we have:

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
The demand elasticity is given by the following:
demand elasticity = (the percentage change in the quantity demanded) / (the percentage change in the price)
We know that the demand elasticity is -3 and the quantity demanded is 1,000. Thus, we have:
-3 = (the percentage change in the quantity demanded) / (the percentage change in the price)
We know that the percentage change in the quantity demanded is equal to the following:
percentage change in the quantity demanded = (the change in the quantity demanded) / (the original quantity demanded)
We know that the change in the quantity demanded is equal to the following:
change in the quantity demanded = (the new quantity demanded) - (the original quantity demanded)
We know that the new quantity demanded is 1,000 and the original quantity demanded is 500. Thus, we have:
change in the quantity demanded = (1,000) - (500) = 500
We know that the percentage change in the quantity demanded is equal to the following:

interest rate = (the difference between the face value and the price of the T-bill) / (the price of the T-bill) * (the number of days in the T-bill / the number of days in a year)
We know that the face value is $ 500,000, the price of the T-bill is $ 485,000, the number of days in the T-bill is 91, and the number of days in a year is 365. Thus, we have:
interest rate = (500,000 - 485,000) / (485,000) * (91 / 365) = 15,000 / 485,000 * 91 / 365 = 1.25 / 4.85 * 0.25 = 0.25 / 1.25 = 1 / 5 = 0.2 = 20 percent. The answer is

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step.
a) The optimal number of transactions to make (n) so as to maximize the amount of interest received from the bonds is equal to the following:
optimal number of transactions to make (n) = (the interest rate) / (the cost of transactions)
We know that the interest rate is 10 percent and the cost of transactions is $5; thus, we have:
optimal number of transactions to make (n) = (10 percent) / ($5) = (0.1) / (5) = 1 / 50 = 1 / 5 = 0.2. That means that the answer should be (B).
b) If you have $10,000 in bonds, the interest rate is 10 percent, the cost of transactions is $5, the optimal amount of transactions is equal to the following:
optimal amount of transactions = (the amount of money in bonds) / (the optimal number of transactions to make (n))

 The efficiency of a transformer is given by \eta = P_{out}/(P_{out} + P_{in}), where P_{out} is the output power and P_{in} is the input power. The input power is the sum of the core loss and the power loss in the resistance of the transformer. The output power is the product of the voltage and the current. The current is given by the power divided by the voltage. So we have that \eta = (10000 * I)/(10000 * I + 0.048 * I^2 + 75), or \eta = (10000 * I)/(10000 * I + 0.048 * I^2 + 75).

 The weight of a solid shaft is given by \pi r^2 l \rho, where r is the radius, l is the length, and \rho is the density. The weight of a hollow shaft is given by \pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) l \rho, where r_1 is the internal radius and r_2 is the external radius. We are told that the weight of the hollow shaft is half that of the solid shaft, so we have that \pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) l \rho = \pi r^2 l \rho / 2. This gives us that r_1^2 - r_2^2 = r^2 / 2. The cost of the hollow shaft is 1.2 times the cost of the solid shaft, so we have that 1.2 \pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) l \rho = \pi r^2 l \rho. This gives us that r_1^2 - r_2^2 = r^2 / 6. We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for r_1 and r_2.

We have that W = \int P dV = \int P d(mRT/P) = mRT \int d(1/P) = mRT \ln(P_2/P_1), where m is the mass of the gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. We have that m = \rho V = (P_1 V)/(RT_1), so W = (P_1 V)/(RT_1)RT \ln(P_2/P_1) = P_1 V \ln(P_2/P_1). Plugging in the values given in the question, we get W = 11 * 10^3 * 200 * 12 * 10^{-6} * \ln(1000/11) = 1.12 * 10^5 Btu.

So we have P = nRT / V. We can also use the ideal gas law to get n = m / M = (m / V) (V / M) = \rho (V / M), so we have P = \rho (V / M) RT / V = \rho RT / M.

 A steady incompressible flow is one in which the velocity field is irrotational and the flow is incompressible. The velocity field is irrotational if the curl of the velocity field is zero. The flow is incompressible if the divergence of the velocity field is zero. So we need to check that the curl and divergence of each of the given velocity fields are zero.

(a) The curl of the velocity field is (partial_x v - partial_y u)/x^2 + y^2 = (kxy + x - kxy - y)/x^2 + y^2 = 0. The divergence of the velocity field is (partial_x u + partial_y v)/x^2 + y^2 = (kx + k - k - k)/x^2 + y^2 = 0. So the answer is (a).

There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter.

There are always 100 gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ pounds of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ pounds per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ pounds of salt per minute.

 The Euler's method is a numerical method for solving initial value problems for ordinary differential equations. The method is based on approximating the solution by a straight line between two points. The method is as follows.

 Let $t$ be the number of hours after 8 A.M. and let $h(t)$ be the water level in feet at time $t$. Then $h(0)=15$ and $h(6)=3$. The water level is dropping at noon today, so $h^{\prime}(4)=h^{\prime}(4+6)=h^{\prime}(10)$ is the answer. We have $h^{\prime}(t)=d / d t\left[15 \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)+3 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)\right]=-\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 15 \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)+\frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 3 \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{6} t\right)$.

 Let $s(t)$ be the number of grams of dye in the tank at time $t$. Then $s(0)=200$. The flow of water into the tank adds $2$ grams of dye per minute. There are always $200$ liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of dye. So the density of dye in the tank is $s / 200$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 200)=s / 100$ grams of dye per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2)-(s / 100)=[200-s] / 100$, and so $[s(t)=200] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,

 The determinant of a matrix is the sum of the products of the elements of each row (or column) with their corresponding cofactors. The cofactor of an element is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the row and column containing that element, multiplied by -1 raised to the power of the sum of the row and column numbers. The cofactor of the element in the first row and first column is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and first column, which is the determinant of the matrix [[8, 3], [5, 4]] = 8*4 - 3*5 = 16 - 15 = 1. The cofactor of the element in the first row and second column is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and second column, which is the determinant of the matrix [[7, 3], [6, 4]] = 7*4 - 3*6 = 28 - 18 = 10. The cofactor of the element in the first row and third column is the determinant of the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and third column, which is the determinant of the matrix [[7, 8], [6, 5

 The volume of the water in the tank is $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot 1^2 \cdot 4 = 4 \pi$. The volume of the water in the tank at time $t$ is $V(t) = 4 \pi (1 - t/100)$. The rate of change of the volume of the water in the tank is $V^{\prime}(t) = -4 \pi / 100$. The rate of change of the volume of the water in the tank is the rate at which water is flowing out of the tank. The rate at which water is flowing out of the tank is $A \cdot v$, where $A$ is the area of the hole and $v$ is the speed of the water flowing out of the hole. The area of the hole is $A = 2^2 = 4 \cdot 10^{-4}$. The speed of the water flowing out of the hole is $v = -g h = -9.8 \cdot 1 = -9.8$. Then $A \cdot v = -3.92 \cdot 10^{-3}$. Then $V^{\prime}(t)

 The Birge-Vieta method is a method for finding a real root of a polynomial equation. It is based on the observation that the real roots of a polynomial equation are the same as the real roots of the equation obtained by replacing each term of the polynomial by its reciprocal. The method is as follows:
1. Find the real roots of the equation obtained by replacing each term of the polynomial by its reciprocal.
2. The real roots of the original equation are the same as the real roots of the equation obtained in step 1.

 The given equation is $f(x) = x^4 - x - 10 = 0$. We have $f(1) = -8$, $f(2) = 14$, $f(3) = 103$. Hence the smallest positive root is between $1$ and $2$. We use the secant method to find the root. We have $f(1) = -8$, $f(2) = 14$, $f(1.5) = -1.125$. Then $f(1.5) = f(1) + f^{\prime}(1.5)(1.5 - 1) = -8 + f^{\prime}(1.5)(0.5)$. Then $f^{\prime}(1.5) = -1.125 + 8 = 6.875$. Then $f^{\prime}(1.5) = 6.875 = 4(1.5)^3 - 1$. Then $f^{\prime}(1.5) = 1.5^3 + 1.5^2 - 1.5 - 1 = 1.5

 The Birge-Vieta method is a method for finding a real root of a polynomial equation of the form $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0$. The method is based on the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial equation of degree $n$ is equal to $-a_{n-1}/a_n$. The method is as follows:
1. Choose a value $p$ for the initial approximation to the root.
2. Compute $q = p - a_0/a_n$.
3. Compute $r = q - a_1/a_{n-1}$.
4. Compute $s = r - a_2/a_{n-2}$.
5. Continue in this way until the desired number of correct decimal places is obtained.
In this case we have $a_n = 1$, $a_{n-1} = -11$, $a_{n-2} = 32$, $a_{n-3} = -22$, and $p = 0.5$. Then $q

 Let $T(t)$ be the temperature of the coffee at time $t$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)$ is the rate of change of the temperature of the coffee at time $t$. The rate of change of the temperature of the coffee at time $t$ is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the coffee at time $t$ and the temperature of the room. So $T^{\prime}(t)=k(T(t)-70)$ for some $k \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $T^{\prime}(t)=k T(t)-70 k$. This is a first order linear differential equation. The general solution is $T(t)=c e^{k t}+70$. We have $T(0)=200$ and $T(1)=190$. So $200=c e^{0}+70$ and $190=c e^{k}+70$. Then $c=130$ and $120=c e^{k}$. So $e^{k}=120 / 130$. Then $T(t)=130 e^{k t}+70$. We want to find $

 The initial velocity is $50 \mathrm{i}+80 \mathrm{k}$, with speed measured in feet per second. The spin of the ball results in a southward acceleration of $4 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{s}^2$, so the acceleration vector is $\mathbf{a}=-4 \mathbf{j}-32 \mathbf{k}$. Then the velocity vector is $\mathbf{v}(t)=50 \mathbf{i}+80 \mathbf{k}-4 t \mathbf{j}-32 t \mathbf{k}$. The ball lands when $\mathbf{v}(t)=0$, so $t=5 / 2$. Then the speed of the ball when it lands is

 The range of the function $y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi – x)$ is the set of all possible values of $y$. The function $sin(pi – x)$ has a range of [-1, 1], so the range of the function $y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi – x)$ is the set of all possible values of $y$ that can be obtained by adding 3 to the range of $sin(pi – x)$. Therefore, the range of the function $y = 5 + 3 * sin(pi – x)$ is the set of all possible values of $y$ that can be obtained by adding 3 to the set of all possible values of $sin(pi – x)$. The set of all possible values of $sin(pi – x)$ is the set of all possible values of $sin(x)$ that can be obtained by subtracting $pi$ from $x$.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on international relations for help. The Westphalian system of state sovereignty is based on the idea that states are the only legitimate actors in the international system and that they should be free to act as they see fit within their own territory. This system was established in the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The idea of state sovereignty is based on the principle of non-intervention, which means that states should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states. This principle is enshrined in the UN Charter, which states that "all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state." However, the idea of state sovereignty has been challenged in recent years by the idea of humanitarian intervention. This is the idea that states should be able to intervene in the internal affairs of other states if they are committing human rights abuses or if there is a risk of genocide. The idea of humanitarian intervention is based on the idea that states have a responsibility to protect their citizens from harm. This idea was first articulated in the 1990s by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty. The idea of humanitarian intervention has been

 The static friction force is the maximum force that can be applied to an object before it starts to move. In this case, the static friction force is the centripetal force that keeps the coin from sliding off the turntable. The centripetal force is given by $F = m v^2/r$, where $m$ is the mass of the coin, $v$ is the speed of the coin, and $r$ is the distance from the center of the turntable. The static friction force is given by $F = \mu N$, where $\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction and $N$ is the normal force. The normal force is equal to the weight of the coin, which is given by $N = m g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. So we have $F = \mu m g = m v^2/r$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = v^2/(\mu g)$. The speed of the coin is given by $v = 2 \pi r / T$, where $T$ is the period of the turntable. The period of the turntable is given by $T = 1 / f$, where $f$ is the frequency of the turntable

 The work required to expand the cell surface is given by the change in the surface energy. The surface energy is given by the surface tension times the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is $4 \pi r^2$, so the surface energy is $4 \pi r^2 \gamma$. The change in the surface energy is the difference between the surface energy before and after the expansion. The surface energy before the expansion is $4 \pi (20.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m})^2 \gamma$, and the surface energy after the expansion is $4 \pi (60.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m})^2 \gamma$.

 The time it takes to cycle each ball through the hands is the time it takes to throw the ball up plus the time it takes to catch the ball. So the time it takes to throw the ball up is $0.9 \mathrm{~s}$ minus the time it takes to catch the ball. The speed of the ball is the height it is thrown up divided by the time it takes to throw the ball up. The height is the speed of the ball times the time it takes to throw the ball up. So the speed of the ball is the height divided by the time it takes to throw the ball up.

 The net force on particle 3 is zero if the net force from particle 1 and the net force from particle 2 are equal and opposite. The net force from particle 1 is $k q_1 q_3/r_1^2$ and the net force from particle 2 is $k q_2 q_3/r_2^2$. The distance $r_1$ is the distance from particle 1 to particle 3, and the distance $r_2$ is the distance from particle 2 to particle 3. Since the net force is zero, we have $k q_1 q_3/r_1^2 = k q_2 q_3/r_2^2$. We can cancel the $k q_3$ terms and the $q_3$ terms, and we can cancel the $k$ terms since they are constants.

 The condition for a diffraction grating is $d \sin \theta = m \lambda$, where $d$ is the distance between the lines, $\theta$ is the angle of the diffracted light, $m$ is the order of the diffraction, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light. The condition for resolving two wavelengths is that the two diffracted light rays must be at different angles. So we have $d \sin \theta_1 = m \lambda_1$ and $d \sin \theta_2 = m \lambda_2$. Subtracting the two equations gives $d (\sin \theta_1 - \sin \theta_2) = m (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)$. The angle $\theta$ is small, so we can use the approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$.

 The power of the motor is given by the input voltage times the input current, or 120 V times 1.0 A, or 120 W. The efficiency of the motor is 75%, so the power output of the motor is 120 W times 0.75, or 90 W. The power output of the motor is the rate of change of the work done on the mass, or the rate of change of the change in the potential energy of the mass. The change in the potential energy of the mass is the mass times the change in the height of the mass, or 6 kg times the change in the height of the mass. The rate of change of the change in the height of the mass is the speed of the mass. So the speed of the mass is 90 W divided by 6 kg times the change in the height of the mass.

 The temperature of the universe is related to the distance between objects in the universe by the Hubble law, $v = H_0 d$, where $v$ is the velocity of a galaxy moving away from us, $d$ is the distance to the galaxy, and $H_0$ is the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is $H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc$, where Mpc is a unit of distance, 1 Mpc = 3.26 million light years. The velocity of a galaxy is related to the temperature of the universe by the Doppler effect, $v = c \Delta \nu / \nu$, where $c$ is the speed of light, $\nu$ is the frequency of the light, and $\Delta \nu$ is the change in frequency due to the Doppler effect. The temperature of the universe is related to the frequency of the light by $T = \nu k_B / h$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $h$ is the Planck constant. So the temperature of the universe is related to the distance between objects in the universe by $T = c \Delta \nu / H_0 d$. We can solve for the distance $d

 The period of a pendulum is given by $T = 2\pi \sqrt{L/g}$, where $L$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The period is a function of the length of the pendulum, so if the length of the pendulum changes, the period will change. The length of the pendulum changes because the temperature changes, and the length of the pendulum is proportional to the temperature. The change in length is $\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T$, where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. The change in period is $\Delta T = \Delta L / (2\pi \sqrt{L/g}) = \alpha \Delta T / (2\pi \sqrt{g})$. The change in period is proportional to the change in temperature, so the change in period is $\Delta T = \alpha \Delta T / (2\pi \sqrt{g}) = \alpha \Delta T / (2\pi \sqrt{9.8 m/s^2}) = 16 \times 10^{-6} \times 10 \times 10^{-3} / (

 The kinetic energy of a non-relativistic electron is $E = p^2/2m = (mv)^2/2m = (1/2)mv^2$. The relativistic kinetic energy is $E = \gamma m c^2 - m c^2 = m c^2 (\gamma - 1)$. The difference between the two is $E_{rel} - E_{nonrel} = m c^2 (\gamma - 1 - 1/2) = m c^2 (\gamma - 3/2)$. We want this to be 1% of the nonrelativistic value, so $m c^2 (\gamma - 3/2) = 0.01 m c^2 (1/2) = 0.005 m c^2$. Solving for $\gamma$, we get $\gamma = 1.005$. The speed is $v = c \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2} = 0.1155 c$. The kinetic energy is $E = m c^2 (\gamma - 1) = 0.005 m c^2 = 3442 eV$. The answer is (

 We can solve this problem by using the equation $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$, where $x$ is the position, $x_0$ is the initial position, $v_0$ is the initial velocity, $a$ is the acceleration, and $t$ is the time. The faster machine starts at the back, so its initial position is $x_0 = 24.5 ft$. The initial velocity of both machines is zero. The faster machine has an acceleration of $a = 3 ft/sec^2$, and the slower machine has an acceleration of $a = 2 ft/sec^2$. We can solve for the time it takes for the faster machine to catch up to the slower machine by setting their positions equal to each other and solving for $t$. This gives us $t = 7.5 sec$. We can then use this time to find the distance the faster machine goes before it catches up to the slower machine by using the equation $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$.

 The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total energy of a system is constant. In this case, the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy is given by $m_E g h$, where $m_E$ is the mass of the earth and $h$ is the height above the earth's surface. The kinetic energy is given by $m_E v^2/2$, where $v$ is the velocity of the body. The total energy is therefore $m_E g h + m_E v^2/2$. At the highest point, the body has no kinetic energy, so the total energy is equal to the potential energy at that point. The potential energy at the highest point is $m_E g R$, where $R$ is the radius of the earth. Therefore, we have $m_E g R = m_E g h + m_E v^2/2$. Solving for $v$, we get $v = sqrt(2 g h - 2 g R)$.

 The energy of the photon is equal to the sum of the rest energies of the two electrons and the positron, plus the kinetic energy of the three particles. The rest energy of each particle is mc^2, so the total rest energy is 3mc^2. The kinetic energy of each particle is 1/2mv^2, where v is the speed of the particles. Since the particles are moving at equal speeds, the total kinetic energy is 3/2mv^2. The total energy of the system is therefore 3mc^2 + 3/2mv^2.

 The work done by the cutting force is the change in kinetic energy of the flywheel. The change in kinetic energy is given by the difference in kinetic energy at the beginning and the end of the stroke. The kinetic energy is given by $KE = I \omega^2/2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular velocity. The moment of inertia is given by $I = m r_g^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $r_g$ is the radius of gyration. The angular velocity is given by $\omega = 2 \pi n$, where $n$ is the number of revolutions per minute. The change in kinetic energy is given by $KE_f - KE_i = I \omega_f^2/2 - I \omega_i^2/2 = m r_g^2 ( \omega_f^2 - \omega_i^2 ) / 2 = m r_g^2 ( 2 \pi n_f - 2 \pi n_i )^2 / 2 = m r_g^2 ( 2 \pi )^2 ( n_f^2 - n_i^2

 The rate of carbon\Elzbar14 decay is proportional to the amount of carbon\Elzbar14 in the sample. So if the rate of decay is 1.5 × 10^4 per second in a living sample, and 9.4 × 10^2 per second in a dead sample, the ratio of the two rates is 1.5 × 10^4/9.4 × 10^2 = 16. The ratio of the two rates is also the ratio of the two amounts of carbon\Elzbar14 in the sample. So the amount of carbon\Elzbar14 in the dead sample is 16 times the amount in the living sample. The amount of carbon\Elzbar14 in the living sample is 1 kg, so the amount in the dead sample is 16 kg. The amount of carbon\Elzbar14 in the dead sample is also the amount of carbon\Elzbar14 in the living sample at the time the dead sample was alive. So the dead sample was alive 16 times as long as the living sample has been alive. The living sample has been alive for 1 year

 The ice will melt until the temperature of the water is 0°C. The heat required to melt the ice is $Q = m_i L_f$, where $m_i$ is the mass of the ice and $L_f$ is the latent heat of fusion of water. The heat required to raise the temperature of the water is $Q = m_w c \Delta T$, where $m_w$ is the mass of the water, $c$ is the specific heat of water, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the water. The heat required to melt the ice is equal to the heat required to raise the temperature of the water, so we have $m_i L_f = m_w c \Delta T$. Solving for $\Delta T$, we have $\Delta T = L_f / c m_i / m_w = 334000 J / (4186 J/kg°C) (0.2 kg) / (0.5 kg) = 15.1°C$. The final temperature of the water is 20°C - 15.1°C = 4.9°C. The

 The energy of an electron in orbit around a proton is given by $E = -13.6 eV/n^2$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number. The angular momentum of an electron in orbit around a proton is given by $L = n \hbar$. The distance of nearest approach is given by $r = n^2 a_0$, where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. The farthest separation is given by $r = n^2 a_0$. In our case, $n = L/\hbar = 1.15 \times 10^{11}$, so the distance of nearest approach is $r = 1.15 \times 10^{11} a_0 = 1.15 \times 10^{11} \times 0.529 \times 10^{-10} m = 5.99 \times 10^{-10} m$. The farthest separation is $r = 1.15 \times 10^{11} a_0 = 1.15 \times 10^{11} \times 0.529 \times 1

 The time difference between the events is the time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame, which is 2 minutes, minus the time difference between the events in the observer's frame. The time difference between the events in the observer's frame is the time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame in the Earth-Sun frame minus the time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame in the observer's frame. The time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame in the Earth-Sun frame is 2 minutes. The time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame in the observer's frame is the time difference between the events in the Earth-Sun frame in the Earth-Sun frame times the Lorentz factor $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}$. So the time difference between the events in the observer's frame is 2 minutes times $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-0.8^2} = 1/\sqrt{1-0.64} = 1/\sqrt{0.36} = 1/0.6 = 1.66666666666666
