 The zona pellucida is a thick layer of extracellular matrix that surrounds the plasma membrane of the oocyte. It is composed of three or four glycoproteins, including ZP3. The zona pellucida serves as a barrier to polyspermy, and it is involved in sperm-egg recognition. The sperm binds to the zona pellucida via the ZP3 receptor. The binding of the ZP3 receptor to ZP3 initiates the acrosomal reaction. The acrosomal reaction is a process in which the sperm releases enzymes that help it penetrate the zona pellucida. The sperm then fuses with the egg. If the ZP3 receptor is blocked, the sperm will not be able to bind to the zona pellucida, and the acrosomal reaction will not occur. If the ZP3 is blocked, the sperm will not be able to bind to the zona pellucida, and the acrosomal reaction will not occur. If the sperm is incubated with purified ZP3, the ZP3 receptor will be blocked, and the acrosomal reaction will not occur. If the eggs are incubated with antibodies that bind to ZP3, the ZP3

 The kangaroo rat is a small rodent that lives in the desert. It has a number of adaptations that allow it to survive in this harsh environment. One of these adaptations is its ability to obtain water from the food it eats. The kangaroo rat is able to extract water from the food it eats by using a process called osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The kangaroo rat has a high concentration of salt in its body, which allows it to extract water from the food it eats. The kangaroo rat also has a number of adaptations that help it to conserve water. One of these adaptations is its ability to produce very concentrated urine. The kangaroo rat's kidneys are able to produce urine that is up to 20 times more concentrated than the urine of other mammals. This allows the kangaroo rat to conserve water by excreting less urine. The kangaroo rat also has a number of adaptations that help it to reduce water loss. One of these adaptations is its ability to reduce its metabolic rate. The kangaroo rat has a very slow metabolic rate, which means that it uses less water to maintain its body temperature. The kangaroo rat also has a number of adaptations that

 The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about twelve hours of fasting in humans). The release of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs, the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin. BMR decreases with age and with the loss of lean body mass. Increasing muscle mass increases BMR. Aerobic fitness level, a product of cardiovascular exercise, while previously thought to have effect on BMR, has been shown in the 1990s not to correlate with BMR when adjusted for fat-free body mass. Fasting causes a decrease in the basal metabolic rate as the body attempts to conserve energy. Sleep slows down metabolic activity, as shown by decreases in cardiac activity, kidney function, and other physiological actions. In humans, the brain (at 1300 grams) generates about 16 watts of entropy, and uses about 20% of the total energy generated by the body. By the time a person eats, their metabolic rate returns to normal. Since the brain generates about 16 watts continuously, the

 The genetic code is the set of rules by which information encoded in genetic material (DNA or RNA sequences) is translated into proteins (amino acid sequences) by living cells. The code defines how sequences of these nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist. The codon AUG is sometimes referred to as the start codon, and the codons UAA, UAG, and UGA are sometimes referred to as stop codons. The codon AUG both codes for methionine and serves as an initiation site: the first AUG in an mRNA's coding region is where translation into protein begins. The genetic code is redundant, meaning that some amino acids are specified by more than one codon, in that all amino acids except methionine and tryptophan are specified by multiple codons. For example, the amino acid glutamic

 The lac operon is a set of genes that are responsible for the metabolism of lactose in some bacterial cells. The lac operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and the presence of lactose. The lac operon is composed of three structural genes, lacZ, lacY, and lacA, which encode the enzymes β-galactosidase, galactoside permease, and thiogalactoside transacetylase, respectively. The lac operon also contains a promoter region, a regulatory gene, lacI, which encodes the lac repressor protein, and an operator region. The lac repressor protein binds to the operator region and prevents the transcription of the structural genes. When lactose is present in the cell, it binds to the lac repressor protein and prevents it from binding to the operator region. This allows the transcription of the structural genes and the production of the enzymes. The lac operon is inducible, meaning that it is only expressed when lactose is present in the cell. The lac operon is also regulated by the availability of glucose. When glucose is present in the cell, it binds to the lac repressor protein and prevents it from binding to the operator region. This allows the

 The biosphere is the global sum of all ecosystems. It can also be termed the zone of life on Earth, a closed system (apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the Earth), and largely self-regulating. By the most general biophysiological definition, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. The biosphere is postulated to have evolved, beginning with a process of biopoiesis (life created naturally from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds) or biogenesis (life created from living matter), at least some 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest evidence for life on Earth includes biogenic graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from Western Greenland, microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from Western Australia, and microbial remains of biogenic graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks found in Western Greenland.

 The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, in the post-absorptive state (meaning that the digestive system is inactive, which requires about twelve hours of fasting in humans). The release of energy in this state is sufficient only for the functioning of the vital organs, the heart, lungs, nervous system, kidneys, liver, intestine, sex organs, muscles, and skin. BMR decreases with age and with the loss of lean body mass. Increasing muscle mass increases BMR. Aerobic fitness level, a product of cardiovascular exercise, while previously thought to have effect on BMR, has been shown in the 1990s not to correlate with BMR when adjusted for fat-free body mass. New research has, however, come to light which suggests anaerobic exercise does increase resting energy consumption (see "Aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise"). Illness, previously consumed food and beverages, environmental temperature, and stress levels can affect one's overall energy expenditure as well as one's BMR. BMR can be measured by gas analysis through either direct or indirect calorimetry, though a rough estimation can be acquired through an equation using age, sex, height, and weight.

 The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. It consists of two periods: one during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, dubbed systole. The ventricular stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat. The stroke volume is not all the blood contained in the left ventricle; normally, only about two-thirds of the blood in the ventricle is expelled with each beat. The stroke volume is equal to the difference between end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume. The stroke volume is calculated using measurements of ventricle volumes from an echocardiogram and subtracting the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of a beat (called end-systolic volume) from the volume of blood just prior to the beat (called end-diastolic volume). The stroke volume is about 70 mL in an average male and about 65 mL in an average female. The stroke volume will increase as the heart rate increases in order to accommodate the increased circulatory requirement. The stroke volume decreases when the heart rate decreases. The

 T-cells are a type of white blood cell that play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. T-cells can be distinguished from other lymphocytes, such as B-cells and natural killer cells, by the presence of a T-cell receptor on the cell surface. They are called T-cells because they mature in the thymus from thymocytes. The thymus is a specialized organ of the immune system. T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, whereas B-cells are primarily responsible for humoral (antibody) immunity. The main types of T-cells are helper T-cells, killer T-cells, and regulatory T-cells. The T-cells are like soldiers who search out and destroy the targeted invaders. T-cells are activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen. The T-cell receptor is a molecule found on the surface of T-cells that is responsible for recognizing antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The ability of T-cell receptors to discriminate between healthy and infected tissue is linked with self tolerance, in which immune cells ignore self antigens that are presented in the absence of co-stimulatory signaling.

The purpose of this test is to determine if a difference between observed data and expected data is due to chance, or if it is due to a relationship between the variables you are studying. The chi-square test is used when you have two categorical variables from a single population. It is used to determine if there is a significant association between the two variables. For example, in a population of 1000 people, 500 are male and 500 are female. If you randomly select 100 people from this population, you would expect 50 to be male and 50 to be female. However, if you actually select 100 people and find that 60 are male and 40 are female, you can use the chi-square test to determine if this difference is due to chance or if there is a significant association between gender and the variable you are studying. In this case, the chi-square test would show that there is a significant association between gender and the variable you are studying.

 The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations below or above the population mean a raw score is. A Z-score of 0 means the raw score is the same as the population mean. A Z-score of 1 means the raw score is 1 standard deviation above the population mean. A Z-score of -1 means the raw score is 1 standard deviation below the population mean. The Z-score is calculated using the formula $Z = (X - \mu) / \sigma$, where $X$ is the raw score, $\mu$ is the population mean, and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. For the first raw score, $X = 115$, $\mu = 118$, and $\sigma = 11$. So $Z = (115 - 118) / 11 = -0.27$. For the second raw score, $X = 134$, $\mu = 118$, and $\sigma = 11$. So $Z = (134 - 118) / 11 = 1.45$. For the third raw score, $X = 99$, $\mu = 118$, and $\sigma = 11$. So $Z = (99 - 118) / 11 = -

We know that the volume is 1.0 L, the pressure is 1.0 atm, the temperature is 273 K, and the gas constant is 0.082 L atm/mol K. We can then solve for the number of moles of chlorine gas produced, which is 0.045 moles. We can then use the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine the number of moles of KClO3 required to produce 0.045 moles of chlorine gas. We can see from the balanced equation that 1 mole of KClO3 is required to produce 3 moles of chlorine gas. Therefore, 0.015 moles of KClO3 are required to produce 0.045 moles of chlorine gas. We can then use the molar mass of KClO3 to determine the mass of KClO3 required. The molar mass of KClO3 is 122.55 g/mol. Therefore, 0.015 moles of KClO3 is equal to 1.84 g of KClO

 The process is adiabatic, so q=0. The process is also reversible, so the change in entropy is zero. The change in entropy is given by $ΔS = nC_{v}ln(T_{2}/T_{1}) + nRln(V_{2}/V_{1})$. Since $ΔS = 0$, we have $nC_{v}ln(T_{2}/T_{1}) = -nRln(V_{2}/V_{1})$. We can solve for $T_{2}$ to get $T_{2} = T_{1}(V_{1}/V_{2})^{R/C_{v}}$. For a monoatomic ideal gas, $C_{v} = 3R/2$, so $T_{2} = T_{1}(V_{1}/V_{2})^{2/3}$. Plugging in the values, we get $T_{2} = 318K$. The change in internal energy is given by $ΔE = nC_{v}(T_{2}-T_{1})$.

This means that the equipartition value of $C_{P}$ for $X(g)$ is $6 cal/deg-mole$ greater than the equipartition value of $C_{P}$ for $N_{2}(g)$. The equipartition value of $C_{P}$ for $N_{2}(g)$ is $7 cal/deg-mole$. Therefore the equipartition value of $C_{P}$ for $X(g)$ is $13 cal/deg-mole$. This means that $X(g)$ has $13$ degrees of freedom. A linear molecule with $n$ atoms has $3n-5$ degrees of freedom. A non-linear molecule with $n$ atoms has $3n-6$ degrees of freedom. Therefore $X(g)$ is a non-linear molecule with $n$ atoms such that $3n-6 = 13$. This means that $n = 6$. Therefore $X(g)$ is a non-linear hexaatomic molecule. The answer is (

 a) The mole fraction of O_2 is the number of moles of O_2 divided by the total number of moles. The total number of moles is 0.100 + 0.100 + 0.100 = 0.300. The number of moles of O_2 is 0.100. Therefore the mole fraction is 0.100/0.300 = 0.333. b) The equilibrium constant K_p is the product of the partial pressures of the products divided by the product of the partial pressures of the reactants. The partial pressure of a gas is the mole fraction of the gas times the total pressure. The partial pressure of SO_2 is 0.333*2.78 = 0.926 atm. The partial pressure of O_2 is 0.333*2.78 = 0.926 atm. The partial pressure of SO_3 is 0.333*2.78 = 0.926 atm. Therefore K_p = (0.926)^2/(0.926)^2 = 1. c) The percent dissociation of SO_3 is the number of moles of SO_3 that dissociate divided by the number of moles

 The melting point of ice is the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are in equilibrium. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation relates the change in pressure to the change in temperature at equilibrium. The equation is $\ln \left(\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\right)=\frac{\Delta_{\text {vap }} H}{R} \cdot \frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{1} T_{2}}$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $T_2$, the melting point of ice at 50 bar. We have $T_{2}=\frac{\Delta_{\text {vap }} H \cdot T_{1}}{\Delta_{\text {vap }} H+R T_{1} \ln \left(\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\right)}$.

 The total entropy change is the sum of the entropy change of the hot block and the cold block. The entropy change of the hot block is $-mC_{p} \ln \left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}\right)$, where $m$ is the mass of the block, $C_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity, $T_{f}$ is the final temperature, and $T_{i}$ is the initial temperature. The entropy change of the cold block is $mC_{p} \ln \left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}\right)$. The total entropy change is therefore $mC_{p} \ln \left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}\right) - mC_{p} \ln \left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}\right) = 2mC_{p} \ln \left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{i}}\right)$. The final temperature is the average of the initial temperatures, which is $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The total entropy change is therefore $2 \times 10.0 \mathrm{~kg}

 The entropy change for an adiabatic reversible expansion is given by $\Delta S = nC_{V} \ln \left(\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right)$. We can use the ideal gas law to find the final temperature, $T_{2}$. $P_{1}V_{1} = nRT_{1}$ and $P_{2}V_{2} = nRT_{2}$. We can divide these two equations to get $\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{P_{2}V_{2}} = \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$. We know that $P_{1} = P_{2}$ and $V_{2} = 2V_{1}$. Therefore $T_{2} = \frac{T_{1}}{2}$. We can now compute the entropy change. $\Delta S = nC_{V} \ln \left(\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right) = nC_{V} \ln \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -nC_{V} \ln (2)$.

 The first step is to determine the mass of ilmenite in the soil. This is equal to 5% of 50 kg, or 2.5 kg. Next we need to determine the mass of water and oxygen that can be produced from this amount of ilmenite. We can do this by computing the molar mass of ilmenite, which is equal to 151.7 g/mol. The mass of 2.5 kg of ilmenite is therefore equal to 16.5 moles. From the first reaction, we see that 1 mole of ilmenite produces 1 mole of water. Therefore 16.5 moles of ilmenite will produce 16.5 moles of water. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so the mass of water produced is 16.5 moles * 18 g/mol = 297 g. From the second reaction, we see that 2 moles of water produce 1 mole of oxygen. Therefore 16.5 moles of water will produce 8.25 moles of oxygen. The molar mass of oxygen is 32 g/mol, so the mass of oxygen produced is 8.25 moles * 32 g

 The molecular weight of the solute can be determined using the boiling point elevation equation. $\Delta T_{b} = K_{b}m$, where $K_{b}$ is the boiling point elevation constant, and $m$ is the molality of the solution. The molality of the solution is equal to the moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The moles of solute can be determined from the weight percent of the solute. The weight percent of the solute is equal to the mass of the solute divided by the mass of the solution, multiplied by 100. The mass of the solution is equal to the mass of the solute plus the mass of the solvent. The mass of the solvent can be determined from the density of benzene, which is 0.8765 g/mL.

 Charles's law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. We can write this as $V \propto T$. We can also write this as $V = kT$, where $k$ is a constant. We can rearrange this to $k = 
rac{V}{T}$. We can use this to find the value of $k$ for each of the three temperatures. We can then use this value of $k$ to find the temperature at which the volume is zero. This is the absolute zero of temperature. We can find the value of $k$ for each of the three temperatures as follows: $k_{-85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} =

The charge of an electron is $1.602 \cdot 10^{-19} C$. Therefore the total charge is $300 \cdot 1.602 \cdot 10^{-19} C = 4.806 \cdot 10^{-17} C$. The Faraday constant is equal to $96485 C/mol$. Therefore the number of moles of electrons is equal to $4.806 \cdot 10^{-17} C \cdot 
rac{1 mol}{96485 C} = 4.98 \cdot 10^{-21} mol$. The half-reaction for the production of chlorine is $2Cl^{-}

 The number of moles of each metal deposited is equal to the number of moles of electrons passed through the cell. The number of moles of electrons is equal to the number of Faradays passed through the cell. The number of Faradays is equal to the number of coulombs passed through the cell divided by the number of coulombs in a Faraday. The number of coulombs passed through the cell is equal to the current multiplied by the time. The current is 1.0 amp, or 1.0 coulomb per second. The time is 1.0 hour, or 3600 seconds. Therefore the number of coulombs passed through the cell is 3600 coulombs. The number of Faradays is therefore 3600 coulombs divided by 96,500 coulombs per Faraday, or 0.0373 Faradays.

The number of moles of solvent is equal to the mass of solvent divided by the molar mass of the solvent.

 First, we need to find the molar concentration of HI. We can do this by dividing the number of moles of HI by the volume of the flask. The number of moles of HI is equal to the mass of HI divided by the molar mass of HI. The molar mass of HI is 127.91 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of HI is 15 g / 127.91 g/mol = 0.117 mol. The molar concentration of HI is therefore 0.117 mol / 12.0 L = 0.00975 mol/L. Now, we can use the equilibrium constant to find the molar concentration of iodine vapor. The equilibrium constant is equal to the concentration of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants. In this case, the products are hydrogen gas and iodine vapor, and the reactants are HI gas. Therefore, the equilibrium constant is equal to the concentration of hydrogen gas times the concentration of iodine vapor divided by the concentration of HI gas. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of iodine vapor.

 The reaction that is most likely to occur is the one that is most spontaneous. The most spontaneous reaction is the one that has the most negative free energy change. The free energy change is related to the cell potential by the equation $\Delta G = -nFE_{cell}$. Therefore the most spontaneous reaction is the one with the most positive cell potential. The cell potential is the difference between the reduction potential of the cathode and the reduction potential of the anode. The reduction potentials of the metals are as follows: $Li^{+} + e^{-}

 The rate law for a reaction is given by the equation $rate = k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}$, where $k$ is the rate constant, $A$ and $B$ are the reactants, and $m$ and $n$ are the orders of the reaction with respect to $A$ and $B$. The order of the reaction with respect to a reactant is the exponent to which the concentration of that reactant is raised in the rate law. The order of the reaction with respect to a reactant can be determined by comparing the initial rates of the reaction when the concentration of that reactant is changed while the concentrations of the other reactants are held constant. In this case, when the concentration of $O_{2}$ is doubled and the concentration of $NO$ is held constant, the initial reaction rate doubles. This means that the order of the reaction with respect to $O_{2}$ is 1. When the concentration of $NO$ is doubled and the concentration of $O_{2}$ is held constant, the initial reaction rate quadruples. This means that the order of the reaction with respect to $NO$ is 2. Therefore, the rate law for this reaction is $rate = k[

 The molar ratio of lipids to proteins is equal to the ratio of the number of moles of lipids to the number of moles of proteins. The number of moles of lipids is equal to the mass of lipids divided by the molecular weight of lipids. The number of moles of proteins is equal to the mass of proteins divided by the molecular weight of proteins. The molar ratio of lipids to proteins is therefore equal to the mass of lipids divided by the molecular weight of lipids divided by the mass of proteins divided by the molecular weight of proteins. The mass of lipids is equal to 40% of the total mass, or 0.4 times the total mass. The mass of proteins is equal to 60% of the total mass, or 0.6 times the total mass. The molar ratio of lipids to proteins is therefore equal to 0.4 times the total mass divided by 800 divided by 0.6 times the total mass divided by 50,000. The total mass cancels out, and we are left with 0.4 divided by 800 divided by 0.6 divided by 50,000. This is equal to 0.0005, or

 The rate of formation of C_2H_6 is k_3 [C_2H_5] [H_2]. We need to express [C_2H_5] in terms of the other concentrations. The rate of formation of C_2H_5 is k_2 [C_2H_4] [H]. The rate of consumption of C_2H_5 is k_3 [C_2H_5] [H_2]. At equilibrium, these two rates are equal, so k_2 [C_2H_4] [H] = k_3 [C_2H_5] [H_2]. Rearranging, we get [C_2H_5] =

 The entropy of a random variable $X$ is defined as $H(X) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log p(x)$. The constraint $E(X)=1$ means that $\sum_{x} x p(x) = 1$. We can use Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. The Lagrangian is $L(p(x), \lambda) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log p(x) + \lambda (\sum_{x} x p(x) - 1)$. The derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to $p(x)$ is $\frac{\partial L}{\partial p(x)} = -\log p(x) - 1 + \lambda x$. Setting this derivative to zero, we get $p(x) = e^{-1+\lambda x}$. The constraint $\sum_{x} p(x) = 1$ gives us $\sum_{x} e^{-1+\lambda x} = 1$. This can be solved for $\lambda$ to get $\lambda = \log 2$. Plugging this back into the expression for $p(x)$, we get $p(x) = 2^{-x}$. The entropy is then $H

In this case, we have $Y=XZ$, where $X$ and $Z$ are independent binary random variables that take on values 0 and 1. Let $P(Z=1)=0.5$. We can compute the mutual information as follows:
$I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$
$H(Y) = -\sum_{y} p(y) \log p(y)$

 The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model defined seven layers. A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of the path. Two instances at one layer are connected by a horizontal connection on that layer. The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls. The session layer is not an official layer in the standard TCP/IP protocol stack used on the Internet. However, recent data suggests that the majority of attacks are happening at the application layer. The answer is

 We can use the following formula to compute the number of labelled forests on n vertices with k connected components:
F(n, k) = n^(n-k) * k!
We can use this formula to compute the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components:
F(8, 5) = 8^(8-5) * 5! = 8^3 * 5! = 8^3 * 120 = 5120
However, we must also account for the fact that vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to different connected components. We can do this by computing the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components, and then subtracting the number of labelled forests on 8 vertices with 5 connected components where vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all belong to the same connected component:
F(8, 5) - F(8, 4) = 5120 - 8^(8-4) * 4! = 5120 - 8^4 * 24 = 5120 - 4096 = 1024

 The normalized throughput of the system is the probability that exactly one station transmits in a time slot. The probability that exactly one station transmits in a time slot is the sum of the probabilities that each station transmits in a time slot and the other two stations do not transmit in a time slot. The probability that station A transmits in a time slot and the other two stations do not transmit in a time slot is p_A*(1-p_B)*(1-p_C) = 0.2*(1-0.3)*(1-0.4) = 0.2*0.7*0.6 = 0.084.

 The maximum throughput of a pipeline is the number of instructions that can be completed per clock cycle. Since both pipelines can complete at most one instruction per clock cycle, the maximum throughput of both pipelines is the same. Thus, statement I is false.
The latency of a single instruction is the number of clock cycles required to complete the instruction. Since M-7 has a 7-stage pipeline and M-5 has a 5-stage pipeline, the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-5’s pipeline than on M-7’s pipeline. Thus, statement II is true.

 We can solve this recurrence by expanding it out:
f(2N + 1) = f(2N) = f(N) + log N
f(2N) = f(N) + log N
f(N) = f(N/2) + log (N/2)
f(N/2) = f(N/4) + log (N/4)
f(N/4) = f(N/8) + log (N/8)
...
f(2) = f(1) + log 1
f(1) = 0
We can now add up all the log terms to get the total value of f(N):
f(N) = log (N/2) + log (N/4) + log (N/8) + ... + log 1
= log (N/2) + log (N/4) + log (N/8) + ... + log 1
= log (N/2 * N/4 * N/8 * ... * 1)
= log (N^log N / 2^log N)
= log N^log N - log 2^log N
= log N log N - log N log 2

 The TCP connect scan is the default and most reliable scan option. It works when the user does not have raw packet privileges. Instead of writing raw packets as most other scan types do, Nmap asks the underlying operating system to establish a connection with the target machine and port by issuing the connect system call. This is the same high-level system call that web browsers, P2P clients, and most other network-enabled applications use to establish a connection. It is part of a programming interface known as the Berkeley Sockets API. Rather than read raw packet responses off the wire, Nmap uses this API to obtain status information on each connection attempt. When SYN scan is requested, Nmap sends a SYN packet, as if to start a normal TCP connection, and waits for a response. A SYN/ACK indicates the port is listening (open), while a RST (reset) is indicative of a non-listener. If no response is received after several retransmissions, the port is marked as filtered. The port is also marked filtered if an ICMP unreachable error (type 3, code 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, or 13) is received. The port is also considered open if a SYN packet (without

bill rate = (face value - price) / price * 365 / days to maturity
We know that the face value is 100,000, the price is 97,987, and the days to maturity is 91; thus, we have:
bill rate = (100,000 - 97,987) / 97,987 * 365 / 91 = 2,013 / 97,987 * 365 / 91 = 0.0205 * 4 = 0.082, which is approximately 8.24%. That means that the bill rate is 8.24%. The coupon-issue yield equivalent is calculated as follows:
coupon-issue yield equivalent = (face value - price) / price * 365 / days to maturity * 100
We know that the face value is 100,000, the price is 97,987, and the days to maturity is 91; thus, we have:

total of withdrawals = (1 - marginal propensity to consume) * (1 - income tax rate) * total output
We know that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.90 and the income tax rate is 0.26; thus, we have:
total of withdrawals = (1 - 0.90) * (1 - 0.26) * total output = 0.1 * 0.74 * total output = 0.074 * total output
We have the following values for total output: $ 1,100 billion, 1,050 billion, 1,000 billion, 950 billion, 900 billion. Thus, we have the following values for the total of withdrawals:
total of withdrawals = 0.074 * $ 1,100 billion = $ 81.4 billion
total of withdrawals = 0.074 * $ 1,050 billion = $ 77.7 billion

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. We know that the price elasticity of demand is equal to the following:
price elasticity of demand = (percentage change in quantity demanded) / (percentage change in price)
We know that the price elasticity of demand is -3 and that the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the following:
percentage change in quantity demanded = (new quantity demanded - old quantity demanded) / (old quantity demanded) = (1000 - 500) / 500 = 500 / 500 = 1
Thus, we have:
-3 = (1) / (percentage change in price)
percentage change in price = (1) / (-3) = -1 / 3
We know that the percentage change in price is equal to the following:
percentage change in price = (new price - old price) / (old price)
Thus, we have:
-1 / 3 = (new price - 5) / 5
new price - 5 = -5 / 3
new price = -5 / 3 + 5 = 10 / 3 = 3.33, which is approximately 3.3. That means

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. The profit maximization rule is to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The marginal revenue is the price, which is $10. The marginal cost is the change in total variable cost divided by the change in output. The change in total variable cost is $80 - $80 = $0. The change in output is 9 - 9 = 0. The marginal cost is $0 / 0 = undefined. The marginal cost is undefined, so the profit maximization rule does not apply. The shutdown rule is to shut down if the price is less than the average variable cost. The average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by the output. The average variable cost is $80 / 9 = $8.89. The price is $10, which is greater than the average variable cost of $8.89. The shutdown rule does not apply. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the price times the output. The total revenue is $10 * 9 = $90. The total cost is the total variable cost plus the total fixed cost. The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100. The profit is $90 -

standard error of the sample autocorrelation = 1 / square root of the number of data points
We know that the number of data points is 250; thus, we have:
standard error of the sample autocorrelation = 1 / square root of 250 = 1 / 15.81 = 0.0632
We know that the critical value for the 5% level of significance is 1.96; thus, we have:
critical value for the 5% level of significance = 1.96 * standard error of the sample autocorrelation = 1.96 * 0.0632 = 0.1239
We know that the sample autocorrelation estimates are the following:
sample autocorrelation estimates = 0.2, -0.15, and -0.1
We know that the sample autocorrelation estimates are statistically significant if they are greater than the critical value for the 5% level of significance; thus, we have:

Thus, we have:
price index in percent for Year 2 = (20) / (10) * 100 = 200%
price index in percent for Year 3 = (25) / (10) * 100 = 250%
price index in percent for Year 4 = (30) / (10) * 100 = 300%
price index in percent for Year 5 = (28) / (10) * 100 = 280%

GNP = Compensation of employees + U.S. exports of goods and services + Capital consumption allowance + Government purchases of goods and services + Indirect business taxes + Net private domestic investment + Transfer payments + U.S. imports of goods and services + Personal taxes + Personal consumption expenditures
GNP = 195.6 + 14.5 + 12.3 + 60.6 + 13.1 + 63.4 + 14.2 + 17.8 + 43.0 + 230.9 = 675.4
We know that NNP is equal to the following:
NNP = GNP - Capital consumption allowance
NNP = 675.4 - 12.3 = 663.1
We know that NI is equal to the following:
NI = NNP - Indirect business taxes - Personal taxes
NI = 663.1 - 13.1 - 43.0 = 607.0

Plugging in f(t) = t^n, we get that L{f(t)} = \int_0^\infty t^n e^{-st} dt. We can integrate by parts, letting u = t^n and dv = e^{-st} dt. Then we have du = nt^{n-1} dt and v = -e^{-st}/s. So we have that L{f(t)} = -t^n e^{-st}/s |_0^\infty + \int_0^\infty n t^{n-1} e^{-st}/s dt. The first term is zero, so we have that L{f(t)} = n/s \int_0^\infty t^{n-1} e^{-st} dt.

 The change in internal energy is given by the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added minus the work done. The work done is given by the integral of PdV, which is equal to 100 psia * (2.0 - 0.5) ft^3 = 150 Btu. So the change in internal energy is 100 Btu - 150 Btu = -50 Btu.

Multiplying both sides by (s + 1)^3 (s + 2)^2, we get s^2 + 3s + 1 = A(s + 1)^2 (s + 2)^2 + B(s + 1) (s + 2)^2 + C(s + 2)^2 + D(s + 1)^3 (s + 2) + E(s + 1)^3. Plugging in s = -1, we get 1 = 4C, so C = 1/4. Plugging in s = -2, we get 3 = 9E, so E = 1/3. Plugging in s = 0, we

 Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of a component in a mixture is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component at a given temperature multiplied by its mole fraction in the mixture. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the components. In this case, the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and the vapor pressure of benzene at 110°F is 0.5 atm. Therefore, the mole fraction of benzene in the mixture is 0.5/1.5 = 0.33. The mole fraction of iso-pentane is 1 - 0.33 = 0.67. The vapor pressure of iso-pentane at 110°F is 0.2 atm.

 The heat generated per unit volume is given by \rho I^2 / A^2, where \rho is the resistivity, I is the current, and A is the cross-sectional area. The heat generated per unit volume is also given by k \nabla^2 T, where k is the thermal conductivity and T is the temperature. Equating these two expressions, we get \rho I^2 / A^2 = k \nabla^2 T. Since the plate is flat, we can assume that the temperature is only a function of x, the distance from the center of the plate. So we have \rho I^2 / A^2 = k d^2 T / dx^2. Integrating twice, we get T = \rho I^2 x^2 / (2 k A^2) + C_1 x + C_2. We know that T = 1500 at x = 0 and x = 1/2, so we have C_2 = 1500 and C_1 = 0. So we have T = \rho I^2 x^2 / (2 k A^2) + 1500.

 a) (1) The average velocity is given by the integral of the velocity profile over the area, divided by the area. So we have that the average velocity is (1/B) \int_0^B u_m (1 - (b^2 / B^2)) db = (u_m / B) (b - (b^3 / 3B^2)) |_0^B = (2/3) u_m. (2) The momentum correction factor is given by the integral of the velocity profile squared over the area, divided by the area, divided by the average velocity squared. So we have that the momentum correction factor is (1/B) \int_0^B u_m^2 (1 - (b^2 / B^2))^2 db / ((2/3) u_m)^2 = (1/B) \int_0^B u_m^2 (1 - (2b^2 / B^2) + (b^4 / B^4)) db / ((2/3) u_m)^2 = (1/B) \int_0^B u_m^2 (1 - (2b^2 / B^2) + (b^4 /

 The rate of diffusion is given by the equation J = -D (dC/dx), where D is the diffusion coefficient, and dC/dx is the concentration gradient. The diffusion coefficient for water in air is 2.4e-5 m^2/s. The concentration gradient is given by (C_1 - C_2)/L, where C_1 is the concentration of water at the bottom of the test tube, C_2 is the concentration of water at the top of the test tube, and L is the length of the test tube. The concentration of water at the bottom of the test tube is 0.023 kg/m^3, and the concentration of water at the top of the test tube is 0. The length of the test tube is 0.16 m. So the concentration gradient is (0.023 - 0)/0.16 = 0.14375 kg/m^4. The rate of diffusion is then J = -D (dC/dx) = -2.4e-5 * 0.14375 = -3.484e-6 kg/m^2s.

Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects. In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements. Only a few foods, such as the flesh of fatty fish, naturally contain significant amounts of vitamin D. In the presence of sun exposure, cholecalciferol can be synthesized from cholesterol in the skin; ergocalciferol is synthesized from the yeast ergosterol. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver and fat. It is converted to calcifediol in the liver. Calcifediol is then converted to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, in the kidneys. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, modulating body defenses against microbial invaders by stimulating the innate immune system.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on clinical knowledge for help. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, which encodes the CFTR protein. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel that is found in the cell membranes of epithelial cells. The CFTR protein is responsible for the transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane. When the CFTR protein is defective, chloride ions cannot be transported across the cell membrane, and this leads to the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. The thick, sticky mucus can block the airways and cause respiratory infections, and it can also block the ducts of the pancreas and liver, leading to pancreatitis and liver cirrhosis. The thick, sticky mucus can also block the ducts of the intestines, leading to malabsorption and malnutrition. The thick, sticky mucus can also block the ducts of the sinuses, leading to sinusitis.

The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late-1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the world's economy can decline. The depression originated in the United States, after a fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide GDP fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on european history for help. The revolutions of 1848 were a series of political upheavals throughout Europe in 1848. It remains the most widespread revolutionary wave in European history. The revolutions were essentially democratic and liberal in nature, with the aim of removing the old monarchical structures and creating independent nation states. The revolutions spread across Europe after an initial revolution began in France in February. Over 50 countries were affected, but there was no coordination or cooperation among their respective revolutionaries. The uprisings were led by shaky ad hoc coalitions of reformers, the middle classes and workers, which did not hold together for long. Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant reform was the abolition of serfdom in Austria and Hungary, where peasants had been tied to the land. The revolutions were most important in France, the Netherlands, the states of the German Confederation that would make up the German Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century, Italy, and the Austrian Empire.

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a peace treaty signed on March 3, 1918, between the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia's participation in World War I. The treaty was signed at German-controlled Brest-Litovsk (Polish: Brześć Litewski; since 1945, Brest, nowadays in Belarus), after two months of negotiations. The treaty was forced on the Bolshevik government by the threat of further advances by German and Austrian forces. According to the treaty, Soviet Russia defaulted on all of Imperial Russia's commitments to the Allies. The treaty was effectively terminated in November 1918, when Germany surrendered to the Allies. However, in the meantime it provided Germany with a huge breathing space during the war (as Russia withdrew from World War I). The treaty was annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The terms of the treaty meant that Germany could transfer substantial forces to the Western Front, contributing to the German spring offensive of 1918.

The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary line drawn in 1859 by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and named by Thomas Huxley, that separates the ecozones of Asia and Wallacea, a transitional zone between Asia and Australia. The line runs through the Indonesian archipelago, between Borneo and Sulawesi (Celebes), and through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok. The distance between Bali and Lombok is small, about 35 kilometres (22 mi). The distributions of many bird species observe the line, since many birds do not cross even the shortest stretches of open ocean water. Some bats have distributions that cross the line, but larger terrestrial mammals are generally limited to one side or the other and have differentiated into different species or even genera. The narrowness of the sea between Bali and Lombok has allowed animals to cross without being able to swim, during periods of low sea levels, but that in itself does not mean it must be a barrier to dispersal. An agent of dispersal is the monsoon, which blows from the southeast during part of the year and allows passive dispersal between Asia and Australia. The deep water of the Lombok Strait, however,

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on european history for help. The Stamp Act was a direct tax imposed by the British Parliament on the colonies of British America. The act required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. These printed materials were legal documents, magazines, newspapers and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies. The Stamp Act was very unpopular among colonists. A consensus considered it a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent—consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant. Their slogan was "No taxation without representation". The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and so had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent. The issue was whether Parliament had the right to tax the colonies, not how much tax to impose. The Stamp Act was passed on March 22, 1765 that became effective on November 1, 1765. The Stamp Act Congress was held in New York in October 1765. The colonists formulated a unified response against the British government for its actions, most effectively with a general boycott of British goods. The boycott proved effective, and the British Parliament withdrew the Stamp Act

 Let $x$ be the horizontal length of the screen. Then the height of the screen is $3x / 5$. The diagonal of the screen is $48$ inches. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have
\[x^2 + (3x/5)^2 = 48^2.\]
Hence
\[x^2 + 9x^2/25 = 48^2.\]
Then
\[x^2 = 48^2 \cdot 25/34.\]
Hence
\[x = 48 \cdot 5/\sqrt{34}.\]
Then
\[48 - x = 48 - 48 \cdot 5/\sqrt{34} = 48 \cdot (1 - 5/\sqrt{34}) = 48 \cdot 3/(\sqrt{34} + 5) = 48 \cdot 3 \cdot (\sqrt{34} - 5)/29.\]
Then
\[48 - x = 48 \cdot 3 \cdot (\sqrt{34} - 5)/29 \approx 48 \cdot 3 \cdot (5.83 - 5)/29 \approx 48 \cdot 3 \cdot 0

 The first option is a loan with an annual interest rate of $10\%$ compounded quarterly. This means that the interest rate is $2.5\%$ every quarter. The loan is for $\$10,\!000$, so the amount of interest that Alex will pay each quarter is $\$250$. After 5 years, Alex will have paid $\$12,\!500$ in interest. At the end of 5 years, Alex will make a payment equal to half of what he owes. This means that he will pay $\$5,\!000$ and the other half will continue to accrue interest. The remaining balance will be $\$5,\!000$ and the interest will be $\$250$ per quarter. After 5 years, the total amount that Alex will have paid back is $\$12,\!500$ in interest and $\$5,\!000$ in principal, for a total of $\$17,\!500$. The second option is a loan with a simple annual interest rate of $12\%$. This means that the interest rate is $12\%$ per year.

 We have to find all triples $(a, b, c)$ of integers such that $a + b > c$, $b + c > a$, $c + a > b$ and $a, b, c \leq 11$. We can assume that $a \leq b \leq c$. Then $a + b > c$ implies that $a + b \geq c + 1$. Hence $a + b + c \geq 2c + 1$. Since $c \leq 11$ we have $a + b + c \geq 23$. The number of triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a + b + c = 23$ is equal to 21. The number of triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a + b + c = 24$ is equal to 22.

 The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method for finding the roots of a function. The method is based on the idea of linear approximation. The method starts with an initial guess for the root, and then iteratively improves the guess by using the linear approximation of the function at the current guess. The method is also known as the Newton's method, the Newton-Raphson method, and the Newton-Fourier method. The method is named after Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.

 We have $3^x - x^2 = 5k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $3^x = 5k + x^2$. Since $3^x$ is odd, $5k + x^2$ is odd. Hence $x$ is odd. Then $x^2$ is odd and $5k$ is even. Hence $k$ is even. Then $k = 2l$ for some $l \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $3^x = 5k + x^2 = 10l + x^2$. Hence $x^2 \equiv 3^x \equiv 3 \mod 10$. Then $x \equiv 3 \mod 10$. Then $x = 3 + 10m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.

 We have
\[y’ = \frac{t^2 + 3y^2}{2ty} = \frac{t}{2y} + \frac{3y}{2t}.\]
Hence
\[y’ - \frac{3y}{2t} = \frac{t}{2y}.\]
Multiplying by $y^2$ we get
\[y^2y’ - \frac{3y^3}{2t} = \frac{t}{2}.\]
Hence
\[\frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{y^3}{3}\right) = \frac{t}{2}.\]
Integrating we get
\[\frac{y^3}{3} = \frac{t^2}{4} + C.\]
Since $y(1) = 1$ we get $C = 1/12$. Hence
\[y^3 = \frac{3t^2}{4} + \frac{1}{4}.\]
Hence
\[y = \left(\frac{3t^2}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\right)^{1/3}.\]

 The Graeffe's root squaring method is a method for approximating the roots of a polynomial. It is based on the observation that the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ are the squares of the roots of the polynomial $P(-\sqrt{x})$. The method is iterative, and at each step the roots are squared. The method is useful for finding the roots of polynomials with real coefficients, but it can also be used for polynomials with complex coefficients. The method is named after the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The method is also known as the Gauss-Newton method.

\[(1-a_n)a_{n+1} > 1/4\]
for all $n$. Hence
\[a_{n+1} > \frac{1}{4(1-a_n)}.\]
Since $a_n < 1$ we have

 The line integral of $f(x,y)$ along a curve $C$ is given by $\int_C f(x,y) ds$, where $ds$ is the arc length element. For the straight line $K$ we have $ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = \sqrt{2} dx$. Hence

For the parabola $L$ we have $ds = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4x^2} dx$. Hence

 We want to find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, and a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. We can write this as $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, $x \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, and $x \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$. We can solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We have $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, so $x = 2 + 3k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $2 + 3k \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $3k \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. We can solve this by finding the inverse of 3 modulo 5, which is 2. So $k \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$, which means $k = 2 + 5j$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this into the first congruence, we get $x = 2 + 3(2

 The characteristic equation is $r^{2}+5 r+6=0$, so the roots are $r=-2$ and $r=-3$. The general solution is $y(t)=c_{1} e^{-2 t}+c_{2} e^{-3 t}$.

Question:
A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?
Options:
A. Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.
B. Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.
C. Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.
D. Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.
E. Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.
F. Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.
Answer: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6

 The number of zeros at the end of $k!$ is the number of factors of 10 in $k!$. Since $10=2 \cdot 5$, we need to count the number of factors of 2 and 5 in $k!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than 5, we only need to count the number of factors of 5. We can do this by counting the number of factors of 5 in each of the numbers 1 through $k$ and adding them up. We can easily see that this is equal to the sum of the number of factors of 5 in each of the numbers 1 through $k$ divided by 5. Since $k$ is the largest number with at least one factor of 5, we can simply add up the number of factors of 5 in each of the numbers 1 through $k$ divided by 5. This is equal to the sum of the numbers 1 through $k$ divided by 5. This is equal to the sum of the numbers 1 through $k$ divided by 5.

 Let $a$ and $b$ be the two positive integers. We know that $a = 45$. We want to find the smallest possible value of $b$. We know that $LCM(a, b) / GCD(a, b) = 33$. We know that $LCM(a, b) = ab / GCD(a, b)$. Thus we have $ab / GCD(a, b) / GCD(a, b) = 33$. This simplifies to $ab / GCD(a, b)^2 = 33$. We know that $a = 45$. Thus we have $45b / GCD(45, b)^2 = 33$. We want to find the smallest possible value of $b$. Thus we want to find the smallest possible value of $GCD(45, b)$. We know that $GCD(45, b)$ is a factor of 45. Thus the smallest possible value of $GCD(45, b)$ is 1. Thus we have $45b / 1^2 = 33$. This simplifies to $45b = 33$. Thus $b = 33 / 45 = 11 / 15$. The answer

 We can use the Viterbi algorithm to solve this problem. The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observations. The Viterbi algorithm works by maintaining a table of the most likely sequence of hidden states for each observation. The table is initialized with the initial state probabilities. For each observation, the Viterbi algorithm calculates the most likely sequence of hidden states for the current observation and the previous observation. The most likely sequence of hidden states is then updated in the table. The Viterbi algorithm continues until all observations have been processed. The most likely sequence of hidden states can then be found by tracing back through the table. The Viterbi algorithm can be used to solve the problem of finding the most likely weather from day 1 to day 4. The Viterbi algorithm can be used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observations.

 We have
\[x dy + (y - xe^x) dx = 0\]
and
\[x dy = (xe^x - y) dx.\]
Hence
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{xe^x - y}{x}.\]
We have
\[\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x}y = e^x.\]
We multiply both sides by $e^{\int \frac{1}{x} dx} = e^{\ln x} = x$ and we get
\[x \frac{dy}{dx} + y = xe^x.\]
Hence
\[\frac{d}{dx} (xy) = xe^x.\]
We integrate both sides and we get
\[xy = \int xe^x dx.\]
We use integration by parts and we get
\[xy = xe^x - e^x + C.\]
We have $y(1) = 0$ and hence $C = -1$. We get
\[xy = xe^x - e^x - 1.\]
Hence
\[y = e^x - \frac{e^x + 1}{

 Let $a$ be the first term of the sequence, $n$ the number of terms, and $d$ the common difference. Then the sum of the sequence is
\[S = \frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d).\]
Since the terms are odd, $d = 2$. Then
\[S = \frac{n}{2}(2a + 2n - 2) = n(a + n - 1).\]
Since $S = 240$, we have
\[n(a + n - 1) = 240.\]
Since $240 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, the possible values of $n$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 80, 120, 240$. For each of these values of $n$, we can find the corresponding value of $a$:

 Let $P(t)$ be the amount of money owed at time $t$. Then $P(0)=100,000$ and $P^{\prime}(t)=0.09 P(t)-800\left(1+\frac{t}{120}ight)$. We can rewrite this as $P^{\prime}(t)=0.09 P(t)-800-\frac{20 t}{3}$. The general solution to this differential equation is $P(t)=C e^{0.09 t}-8000-\frac{200 t}{3}-\frac{2000 t^{2}}{9}$.

 The equation of motion is
\[m\frac{dv}{dt} = mg - 0.2v|v|.\]
We have $m = 0.25$ and $g = 9.8$. The initial condition is $v(0) = 0$. The equation is separable and we have
\[\frac{dv}{2.45 - v^2} = 9.8dt.\]
Integrating we get
\[\frac{1}{2.45}\ln\left|\frac{2.45 - v}{2.45 + v}\right| = 9.8t + C.\]
The initial condition gives $C = 0$. Hence
\[\frac{2.45 - v}{2.45 + v} = e^{-19.6t}.\]
We have $v = 0$ when $t = 0$. We want to find $v$ when $t = \sqrt{30/9.8}$. We have

 We want to find the smallest whole number that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the smallest whole number that satisfies these conditions. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have a system of congruences, we can find a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli. In this case, we have the following system of congruences:
x ≡ 1 (mod 4)
x ≡ 1 (mod 3)
x ≡ 2 (mod 5)
The product of the moduli is 4 * 3 * 5 = 60. So, we can find a unique solution modulo 60. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the solution. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers and the coefficients of the linear combination that produces the greatest common divisor. In this case, we want to find the coefficients of the linear combination that produces the solution to the system of congruences. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients of the linear

 The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and differentiable on the open interval, then there exists a point in the open interval such that the derivative at that point is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval. The function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x is continuous on the interval [0,π] and differentiable on the open interval (0,π). The average rate of change of the function over the interval [0,π] is given by
\[\frac{f(\pi) - f(0)}{\pi - 0} = \frac{2 \sin \pi + \sin 4\pi - (2 \sin 0 + \sin 4 \cdot 0)}{\pi} = 0.\]
The derivative of the function is given by
\[f'(x) = 2 \cos x + 4 \cos 4x.\]
Setting f'(x) = 0, we get
\[2 \cos x + 4 \cos 4x = 0\]
\[2 \cos x = -4 \cos 4x\]

First, we show that $n=18$ works. Let $v$ be a vertex of $K_{18}$. There are 17 edges incident to $v$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least 9 of these edges are the same color. Without loss of generality, assume that at least 9 of these edges are red. Let $S$ be the set of vertices connected to $v$ by a red edge. If any two vertices in $S$ are connected by a red edge, then we have a red $K_4$ with $v$. Otherwise, all edges between vertices in $S$ are blue, so we have a blue $K_9$. Now, we show that $n=17$ does not work. We will construct a coloring of $K_{17}$ that does not contain a red $K_4$ or a blue $K_5$. Let $v$ be a vertex of $K_{17

\[25^{1059} = 23k + 2^{1059}.\]
Hence the remainder is $2^{1059}$. We have $2^3 = 8 = 23 + 8$. Hence $2^6 = 8^2 = (23 + 8)^2 = 23k + 8^2$. Hence $2^6 = 23k + 64 = 23k + 23 + 41$. Hence $2^6 = 23k + 41$. Hence $2^{12} = 23k + 41^2 = 23k + 23 + 18$. Hence $2^{12} = 23k + 18$. Hence $2^{24} = 23k + 18^2 = 23k + 23 + 13$. Hence $2^{24} = 23k + 13$. Hence $2^{48} = 23k + 13^2 = 23k + 23 + 12$. Hence $2^{48} = 23k

 The length of the curve is given by
\[\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1 + y’^2} dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{x^2}} dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{x} dx.\]
We have $y = 1/2$ for $x = e^{1/2}$ and $y = 1$ for $x = e$. Hence

 The Müller method is a root-finding algorithm, a numerical method for solving equations of the form $f(x) = 0$. It is named after the Austrian mathematician David E. Müller. The method is based on quadratic interpolation. The method is also known as the secant method of second order. The method is based on the following formula:
$$
x_{n+1}=x_{n}-rac{2 f\left(x_{n}ight) f\left(x_{n-1}ight)}{f\left(x_{n-1}ight)-2 f\left(x_{n}ight)+f\left(x_{n-2}ight)} .

 The Adams-Bashforth method is a multistep method for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. It is an explicit method. The method is in fact a family of methods, featuring multi-step linear multistep methods with varying numbers of steps. The Adams-Bashforth method is derived from the formula
\[y(x+h) = y(x) + \int_x^{x+h} f(t, y(t)) dt.\]
The integral part is approximated using a polynomial of order $k-1$ which interpolates $f$ over $k$ equidistant points. The resulting method has order $k$. The Adams-Bashforth method is explicit, i.e. the formula for $y_{n+1}$ does not contain $y_{n+1}$ on the right hand side. The Adams-Bashforth method is used together with the Adams-Moulton method to implement a predictor-corrector method for solving ODEs. The Adams-Bashforth method is used to predict the value of the solution. The Adams-Moulton method is then used to correct the value, which results in a method with the same order as the predictor-corrector pair. The Adams-Bashforth method is a linear multistep method

 The Müller method is a root-finding algorithm, a numerical method for solving equations of the form $f(x) = 0$. It is named after the Austrian mathematician David E. Müller. The method is based on quadratic interpolation among three points. The formula for the next iteration is
\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{2C}{B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}\]
where
\[A = f(x_n) - f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})\]
\[B = f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})\]
\[C = f(x_n)\]
and the sign in the denominator is chosen such that the denominator is as large as possible in magnitude. We have
\[A = -0.30103 - 0.30103 - 0.17609 = -0.77815\]
\[B = -0.30103 - 0.17609 = -0.47712\]

 The Birge-Vieta method is a method for finding the roots of a polynomial. It is based on the fact that the roots of a polynomial are the solutions of the equation $p(x) = 0$. The method is as follows:
1. Choose a value for $p$.
2. Find the roots of the polynomial $p(x) = 0$.
3. If the roots are not real, choose a new value for $p$ and repeat step 2.
4. If the roots are real, choose a new value for $p$ and repeat step 2.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the roots are real and correct to three decimals.
In this case, we have $p(x) = x^3 - 11x^2 + 32x - 22$. We choose $p = 0.5$. The roots of the polynomial $p(x) = 0$ are $x = 0.5, 1.5, 2.5$. The roots are not real, so we choose a new value for $p$ and repeat step 2. We choose $p = 1$. The roots of the polynomial $p(x) = 0$ are

 The Taylor series for $f$ at $x=5$ is

Since $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$, we have $f^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{k!}{(k-n)!}\frac{x^{k-n}}{k!}=\sum_{k=n}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k-n}}{(k-n)!}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{k}}{k!}=f(x)$. Thus the Taylor series for $f$ at $x=5$ is

 Let $x$ be the number of red balls in the second urn. Then the probability of getting two balls of the same color is
\[\frac{8}{15} \cdot \frac{x}{x+9} + \frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac{9}{x+9} = \frac{151}{300}.\]
Hence
\[8x + 63 = \frac{151}{300} (15x + 135) = \frac{151}{20} x + \frac{20415}{300}.\]
Thus
\[\frac{151}{20} x - 8x = \frac{20415}{300} - 63 = \frac{20415 - 18900}{300} = \frac{1515}{300} = \frac{505}{100}.\]
Hence

Thus

Hence

 The order of an element $a$ in a group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. In this case, the group is $Z_{12} \times Z_8$, which is the direct product of the groups $Z_{12}$ and $Z_8$. The identity element of $Z_{12} \times Z_8$ is $(0, 0)$, where $0$ is the identity element of $Z_{12}$ and $Z_8$. The order of $(4, 2)$ in $Z_{12} \times Z_8$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $(4, 2)^n = (0, 0)$. We can compute this by using the fact that $(a, b)^n = (a^n, b^n)$ for any element $(a, b)$ in a direct product of groups. So, we have $(4, 2)^n = (4^n, 2^n)$.

 We can use the Viterbi algorithm to solve this problem. The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that can be used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observations. The algorithm works by keeping track of the most likely sequence of hidden states at each time step, and then backtracking to find the most likely sequence of hidden states for the entire sequence of observations. The Viterbi algorithm can be implemented in Python as follows:
```python
def viterbi(obs, states, start_p, trans_p, emit_p):
    V = [{}]
    for st in states:
        V[0][st] = {"prob": start_p[st] * emit_p[st][obs[0]], "prev": None}
    # Run Viterbi when t > 0

 The probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit is the probability that he will eat exactly two different kinds of fruit plus the probability that he will eat all three kinds of fruit. The probability that he will eat exactly two different kinds of fruit is the probability that he will eat the same fruit for breakfast and lunch, and a different fruit for dinner, plus the probability that he will eat the same fruit for breakfast and dinner, and a different fruit for lunch, plus the probability that he will eat the same fruit for lunch and dinner, and a different fruit for breakfast.

 Let $X_{i}$ be the number of white squares remaining after the $i$-th step. Then $X_{0}=N$ and $X_{i+1}=X_{i}-1$ with probability $1 / X_{i}$ and $X_{i+1}=X_{i}$ with probability $1-1 / X_{i}$. Thus
$$
E\left[X_{i+1} \mid X_{i}\right]=X_{i}-1 / X_{i}+X_{i}\left(1-1 / X_{i}\right)=X_{i}-1 / X_{i}

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on formal logic for help. Let’s solve this step by step. We can use the indirect truth table method to determine whether the set of propositions is consistent. We can start with the last proposition, ~G ⊃ ~J, and assume that it is false. This means that ~G is true and ~J is false, which implies that G is false and J is true. We can then use the second proposition, (~E ∨ F) ≡ (H ∨ I), to determine the truth values of E, F, H, and I. If we assume that (~E ∨ F) is true, then (H ∨ I) must also be true, which means that either H or I is true. We can then use the third proposition, I ⊃ (J ⊃ ~H), to determine the truth values of I and H. If we assume that I is true, then (J ⊃ ~H) must also be true, which means that either J is true or ~H is true. However, we already know that J is true, so ~H must be false, which means that H is true. We can then use the first proposition, (E ⊃ F) ⊃ G, to

 The Coriolis effect is the deflection of a moving object due to the rotation of the Earth. The deflection is to the right in the Northern hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern hemisphere. The deflection is also proportional to the sine of the latitude, so at the equator there is no deflection, and at the poles the deflection is the largest. The deflection is also proportional to the velocity of the object, so the faster the object is moving, the greater the deflection. The deflection is also proportional to the time the object is moving, so the longer the object is moving, the greater the deflection.

 The coefficient of restitution is defined as the ratio of the relative velocity of the two particles after the collision to the relative velocity before the collision. In this case, the relative velocity before the collision is $u_1$, and the relative velocity after the collision is $v_1 - v_2$. So the coefficient of restitution is $v_1 - v_2/u_1$. The loss of kinetic energy is the difference between the kinetic energy before the collision and the kinetic energy after the collision. The kinetic energy before the collision is $1/2 m u_1^2$, and the kinetic energy after the collision is $1/2 m v_1^2 + 1/2 (2m) v_2^2$. So the loss of kinetic energy is $1/2 m u_1^2 - 1/2 m v_1^2 - 1/2 (2m) v_2^2$. We can use conservation of momentum to find $v_2$ in terms of $v_1$.

We can find the acceleration from the kinematic equation $x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{1}{2} a t^2$ since the electron starts from rest.

 The heat gained by the water and ice is equal to the heat lost by the aluminum. The heat gained by the water and ice is the heat gained by the water plus the heat gained by the ice. The heat gained by the water is the mass of the water times the specific heat capacity of water times the temperature change. The heat gained by the ice is the mass of the ice times the latent heat of fusion of water. The heat lost by the aluminum is the mass of the aluminum times the specific heat capacity of aluminum times the temperature change. So we have $m_{water} c_{water} \Delta T + m_{ice} L_{fusion} = m_{aluminum} c_{aluminum} \Delta T$.

 The angular momentum of the system is conserved, so the initial angular momentum of the disk is equal to the final angular momentum of the disk plus the man. The initial angular momentum of the disk is the moment of inertia of the disk times the initial angular speed. The moment of inertia of the disk is $1/2 MR^2$, where $M$ is the mass of the disk and $R$ is the radius of the disk. The initial angular speed is $30 rpm = 30 \times 2\pi/60 = 3.14 rad/sec$. The final angular momentum of the disk is the moment of inertia of the disk times the final angular speed. The final angular momentum of the man is the moment of inertia of the man times the final angular speed of the man. The moment of inertia of the man is $MR^2$, where $M$ is the mass of the man and $R$ is the radius of the disk.

 The half-life of polonium is the time it takes for half of the polonium to decay. Since the sample contains 1 polonium atom for every 8.7 × 10^20 uranium nuclei, we can assume that the sample originally contained 8.7 × 10^20 polonium atoms. Therefore, the half-life of polonium is the time it takes for 8.7 × 10^20 polonium atoms to decay to 1 polonium atom. We can use the equation N = N_0 e^(-t/tau) to solve for the half-life, where N is the number of polonium atoms remaining, N_0 is the initial number of polonium atoms, t is the time, and tau is the half-life. Plugging in the values, we get 1 = 8.7 × 10^20 e^(-t/tau). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get ln(1) = ln(8.7 × 10^20) - t/tau. Solving for t, we get t = tau ln(8.7 × 10^20).

 The skier starts from rest, so his initial kinetic energy is zero. He then skis down the hill, gaining kinetic energy and losing gravitational potential energy. The kinetic energy gained is equal to the gravitational potential energy lost, so we can write $m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$. Solving for $v$, we get $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$. The skier then coasts for $70 \mathrm{~m}$ along level snow, so his final kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$. The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy, so we can write $W_{f}=\Delta K E=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$. Solving for $W_{f}$, we get $W_{f}=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}$. The coefficient of kinetic friction is equal to the work done by friction divided by the normal force, so we can write $\mu_{k}=\frac{W_{f}}{F_{N}}=\frac{\frac{1}{2} m v^{2

 The amplitude of a damped harmonic oscillator is given by $A(t) = A_0 e^{-\gamma t/2} \cos(\omega t)$, where $\gamma$ is the damping constant and $\omega$ is the frequency of the damped oscillator. The natural frequency is given by $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega^2 + \gamma^2/4}$. After four cycles, the amplitude has dropped to $1/e$ of its initial value, so $A(4T) = A_0/e$, where $T$ is the period of the damped oscillator. Substituting this into the equation for the amplitude, we get $A_0/e = A_0 e^{-\gamma 4T/2} \cos(\omega 4T)$. Since $\cos(\omega 4T) = 1$, we can simplify this to $1/e = e^{-\gamma 4T/2}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get $-\gamma 4T/2 = 1$. Solving for $\gamma$, we get $\gamma = 1/2T$. Substituting this into the equation for the natural frequency, we get $\omega_

The number of water molecules is the number of moles of water times Avogadro's number. The number of moles of water is the mass of water divided by the molar mass of water. The mass of water is the volume of water times the density of water. So the number of protons is 350,000 liters times 1 kg/liter times 1000 g/kg divided by 18 g/mol times 6.02x10^23 mol^-1 times 10 protons per water molecule. The number of decays per year is the number of protons times the decay rate, which is the inverse of the half-life. So the number of decays per year is 350,000 liters times 1 kg/liter times 1000 g/kg divided by 18 g/mol times 6.02x10^23 mol^-1 times 10 protons per water molecule times 1/(10^33 years) times 1 year/365 days times 1 day/24 hours times 1 hour/3600 seconds. This is about 0.5 decays per year.

 The resolving power of a telescope is given by $\theta = 1.22 \lambda/D$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the telescope. The magnifying power of a telescope is the ratio of the angle subtended by the object when viewed through the telescope to the angle subtended by the object when viewed with the naked eye. So in our case, the magnifying power is $1.22 \lambda/D$ divided by 1.5 minutes, or 0.000000055/0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

 The period of rotation of the earth is 24 hours. If the rotation speed increased until an object at the equator became weightless, the centripetal acceleration would be equal to the gravitational acceleration. The centripetal acceleration is $v^2/r$, where $v$ is the speed of the object and $r$ is the radius of the circle. The gravitational acceleration is $GM/r^2$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the earth, and $r$ is the radius of the earth. So we have $v^2/r = GM/r^2$, or $v^2 = GM/r$. The speed of the object is $v = 2\pi r/T$, where $T$ is the period of rotation. So we have $4\pi^2 r^2/T^2 = GM/r$, or $T^2 = 4\pi^2 r^3/GM$. The mass of the earth is $M = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg, the radius of the earth is $r = 6.371 \times 10^6$ m, and the gravitational constant is $G = 6.674

 The scale reading is the weight of the candies on the scale, which is the mass of the candies on the scale times the acceleration of gravity. The mass of the candies on the scale is the number of candies on the scale times the mass of each candy. The number of candies on the scale is the number of candies dropped times the time, minus the number of candies that have fallen off the scale. The number of candies that have fallen off the scale is the number of candies dropped times the time divided by the time it takes for a candy to fall off the scale. The time it takes for a candy to fall off the scale is the square root of twice the height divided by the acceleration of gravity. So the scale reading is the number of candies dropped times the time times the mass of each candy times the acceleration of gravity minus the number of candies dropped times the time times the mass of each candy times the acceleration of gravity times the time divided by the square root of twice the height divided by the acceleration of gravity. Plugging in the numbers, we get 6 candies per second times 10 seconds times 1 oz. times 32 ft. per second squared minus 6 candies per second times 10 seconds times 1 oz. times 32 ft. per

 The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the number of moles of gas, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature. We can rearrange this to $n = PV/RT$. We can then use this to find the number of moles of gas in the tank at the beginning and end of the process. At the beginning, $n = (1.47 lb/in.^2)(42.5 ft^3)/(0.73 ft^3 lb/(lb mol K))(70 + 460)K = 0.25 lb mol$. At the end, $n = (55.3 lb/in.^2)(42.5 ft^3)/(0.73 ft^3 lb/(lb mol K))(80 + 460)K = 0.75 lb mol$. The difference is 0.5 lb mol. We can then use the ideal gas law again to find the volume of air that must be pumped in. $V = nRT/P = (0.5 lb mol)(0.73 ft^3 lb/(lb mol K))(80 + 460)K/(55.3

 The pressure of the water is given by $P = P_0(1 + \beta \Delta T)(1 - \kappa \Delta P)$, where $\beta$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion and $\kappa$ is the compressibility. The pressure of the vessel is given by $P = P_0(1 + \beta \Delta T)$. Since the vessel is filled completely with water, the pressure of the water and the vessel must be equal. So we have $P_0(1 + \beta_{\text {water }} \Delta T)(1 - \kappa_{\text {water }} \Delta P) = P_0(1 + \beta_{\text {vessel }} \Delta T)$. Solving for $\Delta P$, we get $\Delta P = \frac{\beta_{\text {vessel }} - \beta_{\text {water }}}{\kappa_{\text {water }}} \Delta T$.

 The initial kinetic energies of the two particles are equal, so $m_1 u_1^2 = m_2 u_2^2 = m_2 \alpha^2 u_1^2$, so $m_1 = m_2 \alpha^2$. The final velocities are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$, and we want $\mathbf{v}_1 = 0$. Conservation of momentum gives $m_1 \mathbf{u}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{u}_2 = m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2 = m_2 \mathbf{v}_2$, so $\mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{u}_1 + \alpha \mathbf{u}_1 = (1 + \alpha) \mathbf{u}_1$. Conservation of energy gives $m_1 u_1^2 + m_2 u_2^2 = m_1 v_1^2 + m_2 v_2^2 = m_2 v_2^2$, so $m_1 u_1^2 + m

 The net force on particle 1 must be zero, so the force from particle 2 must be equal and opposite to the force from particle 3. The force from particle 2 is $F_{12} = kq^2/4L^2$. The force from particle 3 is $F_{13} = kq_3q/L_3^2$. Since $F_{12} = F_{13}$, we have $kq^2/4L^2 = kq_3q/L_3^2$, or $q_3 = q/4L_3^2$. The net force on particle 2 must also be zero, so the force from particle 1 must be equal and opposite to the force from particle 3. The force from particle 1 is $F_{21} = kq^2/L_3^2$. The force from particle 3 is $F_{23} = kq_3(4q)/L_3^2$. Since $F_{21} = F_{23}$, we have $kq^2/L_3^2 = kq_3(4q)/L_3^2$, or $q_3 =

 The focal length of a lens is given by $f = (n-1)(1/r_1 - 1/r_2)$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the lens, and $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the radii of curvature of the two sides of the lens. When the lens is immersed in water, the refractive index of the lens is still 1.53, but the refractive index of the surrounding medium is now 1.33. The radii of curvature of the lens do not change, so the focal length of the lens in water is given by $f = (1.53-1.33)(1/r_1 - 1/r_2) = 0.2(1/r_1 - 1/r_2)$. Since the focal length of the lens in air is 10 inches, we have $10 = (1.53-1)(1/r_1 - 1/r_2) = 0.53(1/r_1 - 1/r_2)$. Solving for $1/r_1 - 1/r_2$, we get $1/r_1 - 1/r_2 =

 The lensmaker's equation is $1/f = (n-1)(1/R_1 - 1/R_2 + (n-1)d/nR_1R_2)$, where $f$ is the focal length, $n$ is the index of refraction, $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the two faces, and $d$ is the thickness of the lens. Plugging in the numbers, we get $1/f = (1.5-1)(1/20 - 1/30 + (1.5-1)2/1.5*20*30) = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45 + 0.1/450 = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45 + 0.1/450 = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45 + 0.1/450 = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45 + 0.1/450 = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45 + 0.1/450 = 0.1/30 + 0.1/45

 The power radiated by the sphere is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma A T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the sphere, and $T$ is the temperature of the sphere. The power radiated by the walls of the enclosure is given by the same law, but with the temperature of the walls. The power input required to maintain the sphere at a temperature of 3000 °K is the difference between the power radiated by the sphere and the power radiated by the walls of the enclosure. The power radiated by the sphere is $\sigma A T^4 = \sigma \pi r^2 T^4 = \sigma \pi (0.01 m)^2 (3000 K)^4 = 0.35 \times 5.67 \times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4} \times \pi \times (0.01 m)^2 \times (3000 K)^4 = 0.35 \times 5.67 \times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4} \times \pi \times (0.01

 The flywheel has a moment of inertia $I = MR^2 = 62.5 slugs * (3 ft)^2 = 562.5 slug\bulletft^2$. The initial angular velocity is $120 rev\bulletmin^-1 = 120 rev\bulletmin^-1 * 2\pi rad\bulletrev^-1 * 1 min/60 s = 12.6 rad\bullet s^-1$, and the final angular velocity is $90 rev\bulletmin^-1 = 9.4 rad\bullet s^-1$. The change in angular momentum is $I\Delta\omega = 562.5 slug\bulletft^2 * (9.4 rad\bullet s^-1 - 12.6 rad\bullet s^-1) = -1750 slug\bulletft^2\bulletrad\bullet s^-1$. The torque is the change in angular momentum divided by the time, which is the length of the stroke divided by the initial velocity, or $6 in * 1 ft/12 in / 12.6 rad\bullet s^-1 = 0.04 s$. The torque is then $-1750 slug\bulletft^2\bulletrad\bullet

 The power radiated by the wire is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma A T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $A$ is the surface area of the wire, and $T$ is the temperature of the wire. The power dissipated by the wire is given by $P = I^2 R$, where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance of the wire. Equating these two expressions, we have $I^2 R = \sigma A T^4$. The resistance of the wire is given by $R = \rho L/A$, where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the wire, $L$ is the length of the wire, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire. Substituting this into the previous equation, we have $I^2 \rho L/A = \sigma A T^4$. Rearranging this equation, we have $I = \sqrt{\sigma A^2 T^4/\rho L}$. The cross-sectional area of the wire is given by $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the wire. Substit

 The probability of a neutron producing fission is the cross section times the number of nuclei per unit area. The number of nuclei per unit area is the number of nuclei per unit volume times the thickness of the sample. The number of nuclei per unit volume is the number of nuclei per unit mass times the mass per unit volume, or the density. The number of nuclei per unit mass is the number of nuclei per mole divided by the mass per mole, or the molar mass. The number of nuclei per mole is Avogadro's number. So the probability is the cross section times Avogadro's number times the density times the thickness divided by the molar mass. The cross section is 0.68 barn, or $6.8 \times 10^{-28} m^2$. The density of U-238 is 19.1 g/cm^3. The thickness is 3.2 cm. The molar mass of U-238 is 238 g/mol. Avogadro's number is $6.02 \times 10^{23}$. So the probability is $6.8 \times 10^{-28} m^2 \times 6.02 \times 10^{23} \times 19.1 g

 The net rate of heat loss from the warmer surface is the difference between the heat radiated by the warmer surface and the heat radiated by the cooler surface. The heat radiated by a surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $5.67 \times 10^{-8} W/m^2/K^4$. So the net rate of heat loss is $\sigma (300^4 - 200^4) = 368 W/m^2$. The answer to part (a) is (E). Now, when the aluminum foil is placed between the two surfaces, the net rate of heat loss from the warmer surface is the difference between the heat radiated by the warmer surface and the heat radiated by the aluminum foil. The heat radiated by the aluminum foil is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $P = \sigma T^4$, where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $5.67 \times 10^{-8} W/m^2/K^4$. So the net rate of heat loss is $\sigma (300^4 - T^4)$. The

The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. Early in the disease, the most obvious are shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking. Thinking and behavioral problems may also occur. Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common, occurring in more than a third of people with PD. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. The main motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism, or a "parkinsonian syndrome". The cause of Parkinson's disease is generally unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those with a previous history of melanoma. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood,

The spinal cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. The spinal cord functions primarily in the transmission of neural signals between the brain and the rest of the body, but it also contains neural circuits that can independently control numerous reflexes and central pattern generators. The spinal cord has three major functions: as a conduit for motor information, which travels down the spinal cord, as a conduit for sensory information in the reverse direction, and finally as a center for coordinating certain reflexes. The spinal cord is the main pathway for information connecting the brain and peripheral nervous system. The human spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on psychology for help. Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, and actions. Dissonance is also reduced by justifying, blaming, and denying. The theory was first proposed by psychologist Leon Festinger in 1957. The theory is one of the most influential and extensively studied theories in social psychology.
