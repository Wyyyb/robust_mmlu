 The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The chi-square test is used to determine whether the observed frequencies of a categorical variable differ significantly from the expected frequencies under a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is that the observed frequencies are equal to the expected frequencies. The alternative hypothesis is that the observed frequencies are not equal to the expected frequencies. The chi-square test statistic is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between the observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequency. The chi-square test statistic is then compared to a critical value from a chi-square distribution, or the p-value is calculated. If the p-value is less than a certain significance level (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is concluded that the observed frequencies differ significantly from the expected frequencies. In this case, the observed frequencies are 6022 yellow and 2001 green, and the expected frequencies are 6015 yellow and 2008 green (based on a 3:1 ratio). The chi-square test statistic is calculated as 0.38, and the p-value is 0.54. Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected, and

 The DNA molecule has 180 base pairs. Since it is 20% adenine, it is also 20% thymine. The remaining 60% is comprised of guanine and cytosine. Since the molecule is double-stranded, the number of guanine nucleotides equals the number of cytosine nucleotides. Therefore, the number of cytosine nucleotides is 60% / 2 = 30% of 180, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54. The answer is (None of the above).

Carl's labor demand (marginal revenue product) curve is given by l = 400 - 40MRP_l. To maximize profits, Carl will hire workers until the marginal revenue product equals the marginal cost. The marginal cost is the wage, so we set MRP_l = w. Substituting l = 80w into l = 400 - 40MRP_l, we get 80w = 400 - 40w. Solving for w, we get w = 4. Substituting w = 4 into l = 80w, we get l = 320.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. First, we find the equilibrium quantity and price under perfect competition. The supply curve is the marginal cost curve, so the supply curve is P = 5. The demand curve is Q = 53 - P. We equate the supply and demand curves to find the equilibrium quantity and price. Q = 53 - P, and P = 5, so Q = 53 - 5 = 48. The equilibrium price is 5. Now, we calculate the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. The demand curve is Q = 53 - P, so P = 53 - Q. The consumer surplus is the integral of the demand curve from Q = 0 to Q = 48, minus the equilibrium price times the equilibrium quantity. The consumer surplus is ∫(53 - Q)dQ from Q = 0 to Q = 48, minus 5 * 48. The consumer surplus is [(53Q - 0.5Q^2) from Q = 0 to Q = 48] - 240. The consumer surplus is (53 * 48 - 0.5 * 48^2

The PDV of a future cash flow is calculated by discounting the future cash flow by the interest rate. The PDV of the scotch is calculated by dividing the value of the scotch by (1 + interest rate)^t. The PDV of the scotch is V(t)/(1 + 0.05)^t = exp{2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t}/(1 + 0.05)^t. To maximize the PDV, we need to find the time t that maximizes V(t)/(1 + 0.05)^t. We can do this by taking the derivative of V(t)/(1 + 0.05)^t with respect to t and setting it equal to 0. The derivative of V(t)/(1 + 0.05)^t with respect to t is (2/\sqrt{t} - 0.15)/(1 + 0.05)^t - V(t)/(1 + 0.05)^(t+1) \* ln(1 + 0.05). Setting this equal

We can evaluate this integral by using the trigonometric identity $\sin^{2} \theta = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \cos 2 \theta\right)$. We then have $P = \frac{1}{L} \int_{4.95}^{5.05} \left(1 - \cos \left(\frac{2 \pi x}{L}\right)\right) d x$. This integral can be evaluated by using the fundamental theorem of calculus.

 The change in internal energy is given by $\Delta U = nC_{V,m}\Delta T$. We need to find $\Delta T$. We can use the equation $P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$ to find the final volume. We have $P_1 = 10 atm$, $V_1 = \frac{2.0 mol \cdot 22.4 L/mol}{10.0 cm^2} = 44.8 L$, $P_2 = 1 atm$, and $V_2 = 44.8 L + 20 cm \cdot 10.0 cm^2 = 64.8 L$. Therefore, $T_2 = \frac{P_2V_2}{nR} = \frac{1 atm \cdot 64.8 L}{2.0 mol \cdot 0.08206 L atm/mol K} = 294.5 K$. We can now find $\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 294.5 K - 298.15 K = -3.65 K$.

 First, we need to find the number of moles of ammonium nitrate that decompose. We have 900 g of ammonium nitrate, and the molar mass of ammonium nitrate is 80 g/mol. Therefore, we have 900/80 = 11.25 moles of ammonium nitrate. The decomposition reaction is NH_4NO_3 \ding{217} N_2O + 2H_2O. Therefore, for every mole of ammonium nitrate, we get 1 mole of N_2O gas. We have 11.25 moles of ammonium nitrate, so we get 11.25 moles of N_2O gas. The volume of gas is given by the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. We are given the temperature, 1092\textdegreeC, which is 1365 K.

The moment of inertia $I$ is given by $I = \mu r^2$, where $\mu$ is the reduced mass and $r$ is the internuclear distance. The reduced mass for $^{14}N_2$ is $\mu = \frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2} = \frac{14 \cdot 14}{14+14} = 7$.

 First, we need to find the number of atoms of ^210Po. We can do this by dividing the given mass by the molar mass of ^210Po. The molar mass of ^210Po is 210 g/mol. Therefore, the number of atoms is (4 × 10-^12 g) / (210 g/mol) = 1.90 × 10^16 atoms. Next, we need to find the rate of decay. The rate of decay is given by the formula rate = λN, where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms. The decay constant is given by λ = ln(2) / t_(1/2), where t_(1/2) is the half-life. Therefore, λ = ln(2) / (138 days) = 5.01 × 10-^3 day-^1. Now we can find the rate of decay: rate = (5.01 × 10-^3 day-^1) × (1.90 × 10^16 atoms) = 9.50 × 10^13 atoms/day.

The volume of the ions is the sum of the volumes of the positive and negative ions. The volume of each ion is proportional to the cube of its radius. The total volume is proportional to the cube of the distance between the centers of the ions. In CsCl, the distance between the centers of the ions is the sum of the radii of the positive and negative ions.

 The barometric formula is derived by considering the change in pressure dp for an infinitesimal change in altitude dh. The change in pressure dp is equal to the weight of the column of air of height dh and cross-sectional area A, divided by the area A. The weight of the column of air is equal to the density of the air times the acceleration due to gravity times the height dh. Therefore dp = -rho*g*dh. The density rho is equal to the molar mass M times the pressure p divided by the gas constant R times the temperature T. Therefore dp = -M*p*g/(R*T)*dh. Integrating both sides from sea level to altitude h, we obtain ln(p) = ln(p0) - M*g*h/(R*T). Exponentiating both sides, we obtain p = p0*exp(-M*g*h/(R*T)). The molar mass of air is approximately 0.02896 kg/mol. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2. The gas constant is 8.3145 J/(mol*K). The temperature at 11 km is approximately 216 K.

Therefore $P_{SO_2} = P_{SO_3} = 0.9/2 = 0.45 atm$. Then $K_p = 0.45 \cdot 0.45 = 0.203 atm^2$. (b) We are given an initial $SO_2$ pressure of 0.6 atm. Let $x$ be the change in pressure of $SO_2$ and $SO_3$. Then $P_{SO_2} = 0.6 + x$ and $P_{SO_3} = x$. We know that $K_p = P_{SO_2} \cdot P_{SO_3} = 0.203 atm^2$.

First, we write the combustion reaction of methane: $CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) = CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(g)$. The heat of combustion is given as -192.2 kcal. Next, we write the reverse of the reaction we are interested in: $CO_2(g) + 2H_2(g) = C(s) + 2H_2O(g)$. We can calculate the heat of reaction for this equation by subtracting the heat of formation of water and methane from the heat of combustion of methane. This gives us $\DeltaH = -192.2 + 17.9 + 2 \cdot 57.8 = 24.2 kcal$. To calculate $\DeltaE$, we use the equation $\DeltaE = \DeltaH - \DeltanRT$, where $\Deltan$ is the change in moles of gas.

We can use these values to calculate two separate values of the Rydberg constant. First, we need to convert the wavelengths from angstroms to centimeters: 1215.56 \AA = 1215.56 \cdot 10^{-8} cm = 0.0121556 cm, and 1025.83 \AA = 1025.83 \cdot 10^{-8} cm = 0.0102583 cm.

Since the temperature of the surroundings is 25°C, the work required to freeze the water is given by W = Q * (T2 - T1) / T2, where Q is the heat required to freeze the water, T1 is the temperature of the water, and T2 is the temperature of the surroundings.

The uncertainty in velocity is given as $\Delta v = 10^{-4} mm/s = 10^{-5} cm/s$. We can calculate the momentum as $p = mv = 0.1 kg \cdot 0.1 cm/s = 0.01 kg cm/s$.

The molar mass of H_2O_2 is 34.01 g/mol, so the number of moles of H_2O_2 in 100 grams of solution is 30/34.01 = 0.882 mol. The volume of the solution is 100/1.11 = 90.1 mL = 0.0901 L, so the molarity of the solution is 0.882/0.0901 = 9.80 M. Now, we can use the dissociation constant to find the pH of the solution. The dissociation reaction is H_2O_2 + H_2O → H_3O^+ + OOH^-. The dissociation constant is 1.0 × 10^-12, so [H_3O^+] = sqrt(1.0 × 10^-12 × 9.80) = 3.13 × 10^-7. The

 First, we need to find the number of moles of CaSO4 in the water. We have 6.8 x 10^9 liters of water, and a concentration of 1.8 x 10^-3 g/liter. This means that we have 6.8 x 10^9 x 1.8 x 10^-3 = 12,240 grams of CaSO4. We divide this by the molecular weight of CaSO4, which is 136 g/mole, to get 90,000 moles of CaSO4.

We are given that 20 g of neon are present, so the mass of hydrogen is 0.022 - 0.02 = 0.002 g. The molecular weight of neon is 20 g/mole, so the number of moles of neon is 20 / 20 = 1 mole.

 The first step is to find the number of moles of CaCO3 used. 250 kg of CaCO3 is 250000 g. The molar mass of CaCO3 is 100 g/mol, so the number of moles is 250000 g / 100 g/mol = 2500 mol. The second step is to find the number of moles of sulfur required. From the reaction, 1 mole of CaCO3 requires 2 moles of H2SO3, which requires 1 mole of SO2, which requires 1 mole of sulfur. Therefore, 2500 mol of CaCO3 requires 2500 x 2 = 5000 mol of H2SO3, which requires 5000 mol of SO2, which requires 5000 mol of sulfur. The molar mass of sulfur is 32 g/mol, so the weight of sulfur required is 5000 mol x 32 g/mol = 160000 g = 160 kg. The third step is to find the weight of Ca(HSO3)2 produced. From the reaction, 1 mole of CaCO3 produces 1 mole of Ca(HSO3)2. Therefore, 2500 mol of CaCO3 produces

The atomic weights are C = 12.0, H = 1.01, N = 14.0. The percentages are C = 74.0, H = 8.7, N = 17.3. Dividing the percentages by the atomic weights, we get C = 6.17, H = 8.63, N = 1.24. Dividing by the smallest of these values, we get C = 5, H = 7, N = 1. Therefore, the empirical formula is C_5H_7N. Now, we need to find the molecular formula. We can do this by dividing the molecular weight by the weight of the empirical formula. The weight of the empirical formula is C_5H_7N = 5(12.0) + 7(1.01) + 1(14.0) = 81.71.

 The degree of dissociation is the fraction of molecules that have dissociated. We can calculate this by comparing the observed density of the gas to the expected density if no dissociation had occurred. The expected density is given by the molar mass of PCI_5 divided by the molar volume of a gas at 1 atm and 403 K. The molar mass of PCI_5 is 208.24 g/mol. The molar volume of a gas at 1 atm and 403 K is 32.45 L/mol. Therefore the expected density is 208.24 g/mol / 32.45 L/mol = 6.42 g/L. The observed density is 4.80 g/L. Therefore the degree of dissociation is given by (6.42 - 4.80) / 6.42 = 0.25. The free energy change is given by $\Delta G = -RT ln(K)$. We can calculate $K$ from the degree of dissociation. $K = \frac{\alpha^2}{1 - \alpha} = \frac{0.25^2}{1 - 0.25} = 0.0833$. Therefore $\Delta G = -8.314 J/mol

 The boiling point elevation and freezing point depression of a solution are directly proportional to the molality of the solution. The molality of the solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. We have 10.0 grams of urea, which is equal to 10.0/60.0 = 0.167 moles of urea. We have 200 grams of water, which is equal to 0.2 kilograms of water. Therefore the molality of the solution is 0.167/0.2 = 0.835. The boiling point elevation is equal to Kb*m, where Kb is the boiling point elevation constant, which is equal to 0.52°C/m for water. Therefore the boiling point elevation is equal to 0.52*0.835 = 0.43°C. The boiling point of the solution is therefore 100.43°C. The freezing point depression is equal to Kf*m, where Kf is the freezing point depression constant, which is equal to 1.86°C/m for water. Therefore the freezing point depression is equal to 1.86*0.835 = 1.55°C. The freezing point of the solution is therefore -1.

 Trouton's rule states that the heat of vaporization of a liquid is approximately 21 kcal/mol. The vapor pressure increases by 15 mm Hg per degree at temperatures around its normal boiling point. This means that the boiling point is at 760 mm Hg. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is given by $ln(P_{2}/P_{1}) = ΔH_{vap}/R \cdot (1/T_{1} - 1/T_{2})$. We can use this equation to find the heat of vaporization. We have $ln(760/745) = ΔH_{vap}/R \cdot (1/523 - 1/524)$. Solving for $ΔH_{vap}$, we get $ΔH_{vap} = 10.5 kcal/mol$. The normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is 760 mm Hg. We can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again to find the boiling point.

 The strength of an acid is determined by the ease with which it can donate a proton. This is influenced by the electronegativity of the atom bonded to the hydrogen, as well as the strength of the bond. The more electronegative the atom, the more it will pull the electrons towards itself, making it easier for the hydrogen to leave. The stronger the bond, the harder it is for the hydrogen to leave.

 The rate of effusion is given by Graham's law of effusion, which states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. The rate of effusion is also proportional to the vapour pressure of the gas. Therefore, the rate of effusion is proportional to $\frac{P}{\sqrt{M}}$. The rate of effusion is also proportional to the area of the hole, which is proportional to the square of the diameter of the hole. Therefore, the rate of effusion is proportional to $\frac{Pd^2}{\sqrt{M}}$. The mass of the solid that effuses out in a given time is proportional to the rate of effusion. Therefore, the mass of the solid that effuses out in a given time is proportional to $\frac{Pd^2}{\sqrt{M}}$.

 The potential energy experienced by the electron when it has penetrated the nucleus and is at distance $r$ from the nuclear center is $-e Q / 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r$, where $Q$ is the amount of proton charge within the sphere of radius $r$. The amount of proton charge within the sphere of radius $r$ is $Q = (4/3) \pi r^3 \rho$, where $\rho$ is the charge density of the proton. The charge density of the proton is $\rho = e / (4/3) \pi R^3$, where $R$ is the radius of the proton. Therefore, $Q = e r^3 / R^3$. The potential energy experienced by the electron when it has penetrated the nucleus and is at distance $r$ from the nuclear center is $-e^2 / 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 R^3 r^2$.

 We can evaluate the limit using L'Hopital's rule. We have
$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\ln(1+x)-x}{x^2} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{1+x}-1}{2x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{-x}{(1+x)^2}-1}{2x} = \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{-1}{(1+x)^2}-\frac{1}{x}}{2} = \frac{-1}{2}.

\ln(1+x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \cdots

 First, we need to find the partial pressure of water vapor in the air. The relative humidity is 60%, so the partial pressure of water vapor is 60% of the saturation vapor pressure at 27°C. The saturation vapor pressure at 27°C is 3.56 kPa. Therefore, the partial pressure of water vapor is 0.6 x 3.56 kPa = 2.136 kPa. Next, we need to find the number of moles of water vapor in the air. We can use the ideal gas law to do this: PV = nRT, where P is the partial pressure of water vapor, V is the volume of the room, n is the number of moles of water vapor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Plugging in the values, we get: 2.136 kPa x 400 m^3 = n x 8.3145 J/mol-K x 300 K. Solving for n, we get: n = 0.345 mol.

 First, we need to find the number of moles of oxygen produced. We know that 2 moles of potassium chlorate produce 3 moles of oxygen. We can find the number of moles of potassium chlorate by dividing the given mass by the molar mass of potassium chlorate. The molar mass of potassium chlorate is 122.55 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of potassium chlorate is 1.28 g / 122.55 g/mol = 0.0104 mol. The number of moles of oxygen produced is therefore 0.0104 mol * 3/2 = 0.0156 mol. Next, we need to find the partial pressure of oxygen. The total pressure is 753 mm Hg, and the pressure of water vapor is 17.5 mm Hg. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is 753 mm Hg - 17.5 mm Hg = 735.5 mm Hg. We can convert this to atmospheres by dividing by 760 mm Hg/atm. Therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen is 735.5 mm Hg / 760 mm Hg/atm = 0.967 atm. Finally, we

 The energy added is 40 kJ. The first ionization potential is 735 kJ/mole, which means that 1 mole of Mg atoms requires 735 kJ to be ionized to Mg^+. The second ionization potential is 1447 kJ/mole, which means that 1 mole of Mg^+ requires 1447 kJ to be ionized to Mg^++. The energy added is not enough to ionize all of the Mg atoms to Mg^++. The energy added is not enough to ionize any of the Mg atoms to Mg^++. Therefore, the final mixture will consist of Mg atoms and Mg^+. The amount of Mg atoms ionized to Mg^+ is equal to the energy added divided by the first ionization potential, or 40 kJ / 735 kJ/mole = 0.054 mole.

We get ѵ̅ = R_H [(1/5^2) - (1/10^2)] = R_H [(1/25) - (1/100)] = R_H [(4/100) - (1/100)] = R_H [(3/100)]. The Rydberg constant is 109,677 cm^-1. Therefore, ѵ̅ = 109,677 cm^-1 * (3/100) = 3290.31 cm^-1. The wavelength is the reciprocal of the wave number, so λ = 1/3290.31 cm^-1 = 303.78 nm. This wavelength falls in the Ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

 The Gibbs-Duhem equation is given by $x_1 d \ln a_1 + x_2 d \ln a_2 = 0$. We can rewrite this as $d \ln a_2 = -\frac{x_1}{x_2} d \ln a_1$. We can then integrate both sides to get $\ln a_2 = -\int \frac{x_1}{x_2} d \ln a_1 + C$. We can then substitute in the given equation for $\ln a_1$ to get $\ln a_2 = -\int \frac{x_1}{x_2} ( \frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{A}{R} 2x_2 + \frac{B}{R} 3x_2^2) dx_1 + C$.

 The ground-state energy of a hydrogen atom is $-13.6$ eV. The energy of a mesonic atom is proportional to the reduced mass of the system, which is given by $\mu = \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}}$. The reduced mass of a hydrogen atom is $\mu = \frac{m_{e} m_{p}}{m_{e} + m_{p}} = 0.99946 m_{e}$. The reduced mass of a mesonic atom is $\mu = \frac{m_{\mu} m_{p}}{m_{\mu} + m_{p}} = 0.99518 m_{e}$. The energy of a mesonic atom is therefore $E = -13.6 \cdot \frac{0.99518}{0.99946} = -13.54$ eV.

 The change in pressure dp for an infinitesimal change in altitude dh where the density is ρ is dp=−ρg dh. We know that ρ=MP/RT, where M is the molar mass of the gas, P is the pressure, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Substituting this into the equation for dp, we get dp=−MPg dh/RT.

To evaluate the pressure difference between the top and bottom of a laboratory vessel of height 15 cm, we can use the barometric formula. We know that P=P0e^−Mgh/RT, so ΔP=P0−P=P0(1−e^−Mgh/RT).

 The volume of oxygen necessary to burn completely 1000 cubic feet of butane gas is equal to the number of moles of oxygen required to burn 1000 cubic feet of butane gas, multiplied by the volume of one mole of oxygen gas. The number of moles of oxygen required to burn 1000 cubic feet of butane gas is equal to the number of moles of butane gas, multiplied by the mole ratio of oxygen to butane. The mole ratio of oxygen to butane is 13/2. The number of moles of butane gas is equal to the volume of butane gas divided by the volume of one mole of butane gas.

 First, we need to find the volume of the ribosomes. The volume of a sphere is given by $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$. The radius of the ribosomes is 180 \AA, or 0.018 \mu. Therefore, the volume of a single ribosome is $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.018)^3 = 2.88 \times 10^{-5} \mu^3$. The total volume of the ribosomes is then $25,000 \times 2.88 \times 10^{-5} = 0.72 \mu^3$. The mass of the ribosomes is then $0.72 \mu^3 \times 1.0 g/\mu^3 = 0.72 g$. The mass of the protein in the ribosomes is then $0.72 g \times 0.4 = 0.288 g$. The molecular weight of the protein is then $0.288 g / 25,000 = 1.15 \times 10^4 g/mol$. The length of the protein is then $1.15 \times 10^4 g/mol / 110 g

 The equilibrium constant is given by $K = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]}$. We are given that .7 moles of C are formed when 1 mole of A and 1 mole of B are initially present. This means that .3 moles of A and B are left, and .7 moles of C and D are formed. Therefore, $K = \frac{.7 \cdot .7}{.3 \cdot .3} = 7.00$. Now, we need to find the equilibrium composition when 1 mole each of A, B, C, and D are initially present. Let $x$ be the amount of A and B that react, and $x$ be the amount of C and D that are formed. Then, we have $[A] = [B] = 1 - x$, and $[C] = [D] = 1 + x$. Plugging these values into the equilibrium constant equation, we have $7.00 = \frac{(1 + x)^2}{(1 - x)^2}$. Solving for $x$, we have $x = .45$. Therefore, the concentration of A and B is $1 - .

The number density of particles is given by n = N / V, where N is the number of particles and V is the volume. We are given that there is 1 atom per 100 liters, so n = 1 / 100 L = 1 / 0.1 m^3 = 10 m^-3. The collision cross section is given by σ = π \* d^2, where d is the collision diameter.

 First, we need to find the number of moles of oxygen required to burn 1 mole of gasoline. The balanced equation is $C_8 H_{18} + 25 O_2 → 8 CO_2 + 9 H_2 O$. Therefore, 25 moles of oxygen are required to burn 1 mole of gasoline. The molar mass of oxygen is 32 g/mol, so 25 moles of oxygen weigh 25 x 32 = 800 g. The percentage of oxygen in air is 23.19%, so the weight of air required is 800 / 0.2319 = 3450 g. Finally, we need to convert this to pounds. 1 pound is 453.59 g, so 3450 g is 3450 / 453.59 = 7.6 pounds. The answer is (none of the above).<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

 The solubility product of Fe(OH)_2 is 10-^17. This means that $[Fe^{2+}][OH^{-}]^2 = 10-^17$. We are given that $[Fe^{2+}] = 10-^5$. Therefore, $[OH^{-}]^2 = 10-^12$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $[OH^{-}] = 10-^6$. Since $pOH = -log[OH^{-}]$, we have $pOH = 6$. Since $pH + pOH = 14$, we have $pH = 8$. Similarly, for Fe(OH)_3, we have $[Fe^{3+}][OH^{-}]^3 = 10-^38$. We are given that $[Fe^{3+}] = 10-^5$. Therefore, $[OH^{-}]^3 = 10-^33$. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $[OH^{-}] = 10-^11$. Since $pOH = -log[OH^{-}]$, we have $pOH = 11$. Since $pH + pOH = 14

 The Arrhenius equation is $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT}$. We are given two points on this curve, and we need to find the activation energy $E_a$. We can rearrange the equation to $ln(k) = ln(A) - E_a/RT$. We can then use the two points to find the slope of this line, which is $-E_a/R$. We have $ln(0.343) - ln(0.105) = -E_a/R \cdot (1/791 - 1/759)$. Solving for $E_a$, we get $E_a = 2.2407 \times 10^5 J/mole$. Now we can use the Arrhenius equation to find the rate constant at 836K. We have $k = Ae^{-E_a/RT} = Ae^{-2.2407 \times 10^5/(8.314 \cdot 836)} = Ae^{-2.73}$. We can use one of the given points to find $A$. We have $0.105 = Ae^{-2.2407 \times 10^5/(8.314 \cdot 759)} = Ae^{-2.93}$. Solving

 The characteristic vibrational frequency of the lowest vibration state for H_2 is given by the formula $v = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}$, where $k$ is the force constant and $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the molecule. The reduced mass of H_2 is given by $\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{1.00794 \cdot 1.00794}{1.00794 + 1.00794} = 0.50397$ amu.

 We are given the balanced equation 4NH_3 (g) + 5O_2 (g) \rightarrow 4NO (g) + 6H_2 0 (g). We are asked to find the amount of NH_3 required to react with 80 g of O_2. First, we need to find the mole ratio of NH_3 to O_2. From the equation, we see that 4 moles of NH_3 react with 5 moles of O_2. Therefore, the mole ratio of NH_3 to O_2 is 4:5. Next, we need to find the number of moles of O_2. The molar mass of O_2 is 32 g/mol. Therefore, 80 g of O_2 is equal to 80/32 = 2.5 moles. Now, we can use the mole ratio to find the number of moles of NH_3 required. 2.5 moles of O_2 will react with 2.5 x (4/5) = 2 moles of NH_3. Finally, we can find the mass of NH_3 required.

 The rate of formation of C_2H_6 is given by the rate of step 3. The rate of step 3 is given by k_3 [C_2H_5] [H_2]. We need to express [C_2H_5] in terms of the given concentrations. We can do this by assuming that steps 1 and 2 are in equilibrium. This means that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. For step 1, this means that k_1 [Hg] [H_2] = k_4 [H]^2. For step 2, this means that k_2 [H] [C_2H_4] = k_3 [C_2H_5] [H]. We can solve these equations to get [H] = [(k_1 [Hg] [H_2]) / {k_4}]^1/2 and [C_2H_5] = [(k_2 [C_2H_4]) / {k_3}] [(k_1 [Hg] [H_2]) / {k_4}]^1/2. Substituting these into the rate of

 The first step is to find the number of moles of potassium ions that have moved. This is given by $n = \frac{It}{F}$, where $I$ is the current, $t$ is the time, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. Plugging in the values, we get $n = \frac{.007A \cdot 3600s}{96500C/mol} = 2.43 \cdot 10^{-4} mol$. The distance moved by the boundary is $2.56 cm$, so the velocity of the potassium ions is $v = \frac{2.56 cm}{3600s} = 7.11 \cdot 10^{-4} cm/s$. The mobility of the potassium ions is then $\mu_+ = \frac{v}{E}$, where $E$ is the electric field. The electric field is given by $E = \frac{I}{A \cdot \Lambda}$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $\Lambda$ is the molar conductivity.

 The heat capacity at constant pressure, C_p, is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by 1 K at constant pressure. The heat capacity at constant pressure for a solid is typically around 6 cal K^-1mol^-1, for a diatomic gas around 5 cal K^-1mol^-1, and for a triatomic gas around 7 cal K^-1mol^-1. For H_2O(g), the contribution to C_p from the vibrational mode is 20%, which means that the heat capacity at constant pressure for H_2O(g) is 8 cal K^-1mol^-1 + 20% of 8 cal K^-1mol^-1 = 8 cal K^-1mol^-1 + 1.6 cal K^-1mol^-1 = 9.6 cal K^-1mol^-1. Therefore, the heat capacity at constant pressure for each of the substances in the reaction is C(s): 6 cal K^-1mol^-1, H_2O(g): 9.6 cal K^-1mol^-1, CO_2(g): 7.9 cal K^-1mol^-1, H_2(g):

We can use Kirchoff's equation, which states that \DeltaH_2 = \DeltaH_1 + \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \DeltaC_p dT.

 The entropy of a discrete random variable X is given by H(X) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log_2 p(x). We want to maximize this entropy subject to the constraint E(X) = \sum_{x} x p(x) = 1. We can use Lagrange multipliers to solve this problem. Let L(p) = -\sum_{x} p(x) \log_2 p(x) - \lambda (\sum_{x} x p(x) - 1). Taking the derivative of L with respect to p(x) and setting it to zero, we get -\log_2 p(x) - 1 - \lambda x = 0. Solving for p(x), we get p(x) = 2^{-(1 + \lambda x)}. The constraint E(X) = 1 gives us \sum_{x} x 2^{-(1 + \lambda x)} = 1. Solving for \lambda, we get \lambda = 1. Plugging this back into p(x), we get p(x) = 2^{-(x + 1)}. The entropy is then H(X) = -\sum_{x} 2^{-(x + 1

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, we need to calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using the expenditure approach. GDP = C + I_net + G + (X - M) = 660 + 57 + 233 + 2 = 952. Now, we need to calculate the Gross National Income (GNI) using the income approach. GNI = Compensation of employees + Operating surplus + Mixed income = 642 + 81 + 68 = 791. Now, we need to calculate the Net National Income (NNI) by subtracting the capital consumption allowance (depreciation) from the GNI. NNI = GNI - D = 791 - 95 = 696. Now, we need to calculate the Personal Income (PI) by adding the transfer payments and the interest to the NNI, and subtracting the social security taxes and the personal taxes. PI = NNI + Transfer payments + Interest - Social security taxes - Personal taxes = 696 + 127 + 20 - 46 - 116 = 681. Finally, we need to calculate the Disposable Personal Income (DPI) by subtracting the personal taxes

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, we need to find the profit function. Profit is equal to revenue minus total cost. Revenue is equal to price times quantity, and price is given by the demand function. Thus, we have:
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost = P * q - TC = (15 - 0.05q) * q - (q + 0.02q^2) = 15q - 0.05q^2 - q - 0.02q^2 = 14q - 0.07q^2
To find the point of profit maximization, we need to find the first derivative of the profit function with respect to quantity and set it equal to zero:
dProfit/dq = 14 - 0.14q = 0
Now, we can solve for q:
14 - 0.14q = 0 => 0.14q = 14 => q = 100
Now, we can find the price at the point of profit maximization by substituting q into the demand function:
P = 15 - 0.05q = 15 - 0.

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, we need to find the total revenue at the optimal output of 5 units. We can do this by multiplying the price by the quantity at each level and then summing them up. The total revenue is equal to 109 + 2 * 105 + 3 * 100 + 4 * 96 + 5 * 91 = 109 + 210 + 300 + 384 + 455 = 1458. Now, we can find the profit without price discrimination by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. The profit without price discrimination is equal to 1458 - 405 = 1053. Now, let’s find the profit with price discrimination. The profit with price discrimination is equal to the sum of the differences between the price and the marginal revenue at each level. The marginal revenue is equal to the difference between the price at the current level and the price at the previous level. The profit with price discrimination is equal to (109 - 105) + 2 * (105 - 100) + 3 * (100 - 96) + 4 * (96 - 91)

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on macroeconomics for help. Let’s solve this problem step by step. First of all, let’s calculate the initial disposable income. Disposable income is equal to income minus income tax. The initial income tax rate is 20%, so the initial disposable income is equal to 80% of income. Now, let’s calculate the initial consumption. Consumption is equal to 85% of disposable income, so it is equal to 85% of 80% of income, which is 68% of income. Now, let’s consider the case of income tax increase. The new income tax rate is 24%, so the new disposable income is equal to 76% of income. The new consumption is equal to 85% of disposable income, so it is equal to 85% of 76% of income, which is 64.6% of income. The change in consumption is equal to -3.4% of income. Now, let’s consider the case of sales tax increase. The new consumption is equal to 85% of disposable income divided by (1 + 0.04), so it is equal to 81.7% of disposable income, which is 81.7% of 80%

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on microeconomics for help. To solve this problem, we need to find the optimal bundle of A and B that maximizes David's utility given his budget constraint. The budget constraint is 7 = x + y, where x is the number of units of A and y is the number of units of B. We can rewrite this as y = 7 - x. The utility function is U(x, y) = ∫(10 - x) dx + ∫(21 - 2y) dy. We can rewrite this as U(x, y) = 10x - 0.5x^2 + 21y - y^2. Substituting y = 7 - x, we have U(x) = 10x - 0.5x^2 + 21(7 - x) - (7 - x)^2. Taking the derivative of U(x) with respect to x, we have dU/dx = 10 - x - 21 + 2x + 14 - 2x = -7 + x. Setting dU/dx = 0, we have x = 7. Substituting x = 7 into y = 7

In this case, we are given the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the income tax rate. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is equal to 1 - MPC = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10. The average propensity to save (APS) is equal to MPS = 0.10. The average propensity to tax (APT) is equal to the income tax rate = 0.26. The total of withdrawals from the economic income-expenditure circuit is equal to the sum of savings and taxes. Savings are equal to APS * total output, and taxes are equal to APT * total output. Now, let’s calculate the total of withdrawals for each level of total output:
(A) $ 1,100 billion: Savings = 0.10 * 1,100 = 110 billion; Taxes = 0.26 * 1,100 = 286 billion; Total withdrawals = 110 + 286 = 396 billion.

Profit = Revenue - Cost = Price * Quantity - Cost = 52.5 * Quantity - Cost
Now, let’s calculate the profit function for each quantity:
Profit = 52.5 * Quantity - Cost
Profit = 52.5 * 4,000 - 180,000 = -30,000
Profit = 52.5 * 5,000 - 190,000 = -12,500
Profit = 52.5 * 6,000 - 200,000 = 5,000
Profit = 52.5 * 7,000 - 210,000 = 22,500
Profit = 52.5 * 8,000 - 220,000 = 40,000
Profit = 52.5 * 9,000 - 230,000 = 57,500

test statistic = T * (ln(det(sigma_VAR(6))) - ln(det(sigma_VAR(4))))
where ln denotes the natural log function, det the determinant function, and T the number of observations (which, in this case, is equal to 250). Now, let’s calculate the value of the test statistic:
test statistic = 250 * (ln(0.0036) - ln(0.0049)) = 250 * (-5.799 - (-5.293)) = 250 * (-0.506) = -126.5
Now, we need to divide the result by the number of restrictions, which is equal to 4 (because we are testing whether the VAR(6) can be restricted to a VAR(4), and the difference in the number of parameters is 4). Thus, we have:
test statistic = -126.5 / 4 = -31.625

 We have that F(z) = (2z^2 - 2z) / ((z - 3) (z - 5)^2). We can expand this using partial fractions to get F(z) = (A / (z - 3)) + (B / (z - 5)) + (C / (z - 5)^2). Multiplying both sides by the denominator, we get 2z^2 - 2z = A(z - 5)^2 + B(z - 3)(z - 5) + C(z - 3). Plugging in z = 3, we get A = 4/16. Plugging in z = 5, we get C = 5/6. Taking the derivative of both sides and plugging in z = 5, we get B = -1/6. So we have that F(z) = (4/16) / (z - 3) + (-1/6) / (z - 5) + (5/6) / (z - 5)^2.

We are given that T_s = 500°F = 523.3 K, and T_e = 120°F = 322.2 K. We need to find h. We can use the correlation for natural convection on a vertical plate, which is Nu = 0.59 Ra^{1/4}, where Nu is the Nusselt number, and Ra is the Rayleigh number. We can calculate Ra using the given temperatures and the properties of air at the film temperature (the average of the surface and ambient temperatures). We get Ra = 1.33e9.

 The heat of combustion is the energy released when one mole of methane is burned. This energy is used to heat up the products of combustion. The maximum temperature of combustion is achieved when all of this energy is used to heat up the products. We can calculate the maximum temperature of combustion by using the heat capacity of the products and the heat of combustion. The heat capacity of the products is the sum of the heat capacities of CO_2, H_2O, and N_2. The heat capacity of CO_2 is 10.9 cal/(g°C), the heat capacity of H_2O is 8.0 cal/(g°C), and the heat capacity of N_2 is 7.0 cal/(g°C). The heat of combustion is 48,418.7 kcal/mole. We can calculate the maximum temperature of combustion for the constant volume process as follows: Q = ΔU = nC_vΔT, where Q is the heat of combustion, ΔU is the change in internal energy, n is the number of moles of products, C_v is the heat capacity of the products at constant volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

 The electric field is radial, so the potential is a function of theta only. The boundary conditions are that the potential is constant on the cone and zero on the plane. The solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates is V(r,theta) = sum from l=0 to infinity of (A_l/r^(l+1)) * P_l(cos(theta)), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial of degree l. The boundary conditions give A_l = 0 for l > 0, and A_0 = V_0. So V(r,theta) = V_0/r. The electric field is E = -grad(V) = V_0/r^2 * (e_r - e_theta * cot(theta)). The surface charge density on the cone is sigma = epsilon_0 * E_r = epsilon_0 * V_0/r^2.

 The length of a half-wave dipole antenna is given by λ/2, where λ is the wavelength of the signal. The wavelength is given by v/f, where v is the velocity of the signal and f is the frequency. The velocity factor is the ratio of the velocity of the signal in the antenna to the velocity of light in free space. So we have λ = v/f = (vf)/f = vf, where vf is the velocity factor.

 The first step is to find the head loss in the pipe. We can do this by using the pump power and efficiency. The pump power is 80 hp, and the efficiency is 65%, so the actual power delivered to the fluid is 0.65 * 80 = 52 hp. We can convert this to Watts by multiplying by 745.7, giving 38,800 W.

 a) The work done is given by the integral of P dV. Since PV is constant, P = P_0 V_0 / V. So the work done is P_0 V_0 \int_{V_0}^{2V_0} (1/V) dV = P_0 V_0 \ln(2) = 200 \times 144 \times \ln(2) = 19,930 ft-lb_f. b) The work done is given by the change in energy of the system. The energy of the system is given by P_0 V_0. The initial energy is 200 \times 144 = 28,800 ft-lb_f. The final energy is 100 \times 288 = 28,800 ft-lb_f. So the work done is 28,800 - 28,800 = 0 ft-lb_f. However, this is not an option, so we must assume that the question is asking for the work done by the external force. In this case, the work done is given by the change in energy of the external force. The initial energy is 200 \times 144 = 28,800 ft-lb_f. The

The heat flux is given by q = h * (T_s - T_amb), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, T_s is the surface temperature, and T_amb is the ambient temperature. We can rearrange this to get T_s = q / h + T_amb. We need to find h. We can use the correlation for free convection on a vertical plate, which is Nu = 0.59 * (Gr * Pr)^0.25.

 The heat transfer rate is given by Q = m c_p \Delta T, where m is the mass flow rate, c_p is the specific heat capacity of water, and \Delta T is the temperature difference. We can rearrange this to get \Delta T = Q / (m c_p). The heat transfer rate is given by Q = h A \Delta T, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area, and \Delta T is the temperature difference. We can rearrange this to get \Delta T = Q / (h A). Equating these two expressions for \Delta T, we get Q / (m c_p) = Q / (h A). Canceling Q, we get 1 / (m c_p) = 1 / (h A). Rearranging, we get h A = m c_p.

 The power transmitted is 50 hp, which is 37.3 kW. The torque is then 37.3 kW / (1000 rpm * (2 \pi / 60)) = 355.7 Nm. The force exerted on each bearing is then (355.7 Nm) / (0.5 * 0.127 m) = 5600 N. Converting to pounds, we get 5600 N * (1 lb / 4.45 N) = 1260 lb. Since there are two bearings, the force on each bearing is 1260 lb / 2 = 630 lb. The answer is (None of the above).

From the first equation, we have that \partialV / \partialT = k_1(C_P / C_V)T^{(C)P/(C)V}-1 V. Integrating both sides with respect to T, we get V = k_1(C_P / C_V)T^{(C)P/(C)V}V_0 + f(P), where V_0 is a constant. From the second equation, we have that \partialV / \partialP = -k_2 / P V. Integrating both sides with respect to P, we get V = -k_2 ln(P) + g(T), where g(T) is a function of T. Equating the two expressions for V, we get k_1(C_P / C_V)T^{(C)P/(C)V}V_0 + f(P) = -k_2 ln(P) +

 Let $x$ be the distance from the foot of the ladder to the building, and let $y$ be the height of the top of the ladder above the ground. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem, $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$. Differentiating both sides with respect to time, we get $2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$. We are given that $\frac{dx}{dt} = 3$ and $x = 10$. We need to find $\frac{dy}{dt}$. We can find $y$ by substituting $x = 10$ into $x^2 + y^2 = 26^2$, which gives $y = \sqrt{26^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{576} = 24$. Then, substituting $x = 10$, $y = 24$, and $\frac{dx}{dt} = 3$ into $2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0$, we get $2(10)(3) + 2(24) \

 The covariance of two random variables X and Y is defined as Cov(X, Y) = E((X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))), where E(X) is the expected value of X. In this case, we have x = (1, 2, 3, 4) and y = (2, 3, 4, 5). We can calculate the mean of x and y as follows: E(x) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5, E(y) = (2 + 3 + 4 + 5)/4 = 14/4 = 3.5. Now, we can calculate the covariance as follows: Cov(x, y) = ((1 - 2.5)(2 - 3.5) + (2 - 2.5)(3 - 3.5) + (3 - 2.5)(4 - 3.5) + (4 - 2.5)(5 - 3.5))/4 = ((-1.5)(-1.5) + (0.5)(-0.5) + (0.5)(0.5

 The characteristic equation is $4r^2 + 12r + 9 = 0$, which has a double root $r = -\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, the general solution is $y(t) = c_1e^{-\frac{3}{2}t} + c_2te^{-\frac{3}{2}t}$. Using the initial conditions, we have $y(0) = 1 = c_1$ and $y'(0) = -4 = -\frac{3}{2}c_1 + c_2$. Therefore, $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = 2$. The solution is $y(t) = e^{-\frac{3}{2}t} + 2te^{-\frac{3}{2}t}$. To find where the solution has the value zero, we set $y(t) = 0$ and solve for $t$. We have $e^{-\frac{3}{2}t} + 2te^{-\frac{3}{2}t} = 0$, which implies $e^{-\frac{3}{2}t}(1 + 2t) =

 Let $s(t)$ denote the amount of salt in the tank at time $t$. Then $s(0) = 50$. We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution flowing into the tank adds $2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4} \sin t$ ounces of salt per minute. There are always 100 gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ ounces of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ ounces per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2 \cdot s / 100=s / 50$ ounces of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4} \sin t\right)-\frac{s}{50}$, and so $[s(t)=50] \Rightarrow\left

 Let $s(t)$ denote the amount of salt in the tank at time $t$ minutes. Then $s(0) = 0$. For $0 \le t \le 10$, we have $s^{\prime}(t) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2s(t)}{100} = 1 - \frac{s(t)}{50}$. Then $s^{\prime}(t) + \frac{1}{50}s(t) = 1$. The general solution is $s(t) = 50 + Ce^{-t/50}$. Since $s(0) = 0$, we have $C = -50$, so $s(t) = 50(1 - e^{-t/50})$. Then $s(10) = 50(1 - e^{-10/50}) = 50(1 - e^{-1/5})$. For $10 \le t \le 20$, we have $s^{\prime}(t) = -\frac{2s(t)}{100 + 20} = -\frac{s(t)}{60}$. Then $s^{\prime}(t) + \frac{

Then $45 = 50e^{-9k}$, so $e^{-9k} = 45/50 = 9/10$. Then $-9k = \ln(9/10)$, so $k = -\ln(9/10)/9$. Then $m(t) = 50e^{t\ln(9/10)/9}$. We want to find $t$ such that $m(t) = 20$.

 Let $h(t)$ be the height of the water at time $t$ hours after 8 A.M. Then $h(t) = A \sin(Bt + C) + D$ for some constants $A, B, C, D$. We know that $h(0) = 15$ and $h(6) = 3$. We also know that $h(t)$ has a period of 12 hours, so $B = \pi/6$. Then $h(t) = A \sin(\pi t/6 + C) + D$. We have $15 = h(0) = A \sin(C) + D$ and $3 = h(6) = A \sin(\pi + C) + D = -A \sin(C) + D$. Adding these two equations, we get $18 = 2D$, so $D = 9$. Subtracting the two equations, we get $12 = 2A \sin(C)$, so $A \sin(C) = 6$. Then $h(t) = 6 \sin(\pi t/6 + C) + 9$. We want to find $h’(0)$, which is the rate at which

The curvature is given by $\kappa = \frac{|f’’(x)|}{(1 + f’(x)^2)^{3/2}}$. We have $f’’(2) = \frac{2\cdot 2^2 - 8\cdot 2 + 4}{4(4\cdot 2 - 2^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{4}{4\cdot 2^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{2^{3/2}}$.

 We are asked to solve the equation $\sin(4x) + x = 54$ using the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The method starts with an initial guess and then iteratively replaces the guess with a better estimate using the formula $x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$. In our case, $f(x) = \sin(4x) + x - 54$. We have $f'(x) = 4\cos(4x) + 1$. We start with an initial guess of $x_0 = 54$. Then $x_1 = 54 - \frac{\sin(216) + 54 - 54}{4\cos(216) + 1} = 54.25$. Then $x_2 = 54.25 - \frac{\sin(217) + 54.25 - 54}{4\cos(217) + 1} = 54.76$. Then $x_3 = 54.76 - \frac{\

 The probability that the maximum number of successes with one of the drugs exceeds eight is equal to one minus the probability that the maximum number of successes with one of the drugs is less than or equal to eight. The probability that the maximum number of successes with one of the drugs is less than or equal to eight is equal to the probability that each of the three drugs has less than or equal to eight successes. The probability that each of the three drugs has less than or equal to eight successes is equal to the probability that one of the drugs has less than or equal to eight successes cubed. The probability that one of the drugs has less than or equal to eight successes is equal to the sum of the probabilities that one of the drugs has $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$ successes. The probability that one of the drugs has $k$ successes is equal to $\binom{10}{k}p^k(1-p)^{10-k}$, where $p=0.7$.

 We have that the mean income is $20,500, and the standard deviation of their incomes is $3,750. The distribution of incomes is normally distributed. We want to find the number of employees with an income of between $13,000 and $28,000. We have that $13,000 = 20,500 - 3 \cdot 3,750$ and $28,000 = 20,500 + 2 \cdot 3,750$. Thus, we want to find the number of employees with an income of between $-3$ and $2$ standard deviations from the mean. We know that $99.7\%$ of the data is within $3$ standard deviations from the mean, and $95\%$ of the data is within $2$ standard deviations from the mean. Thus, we have that $99.7\% - 95\% = 4.7\%$ of the data is between $-3$ and $-2$ standard deviations from the mean, and $95\% - 68\% = 27\%$ of the data is between $-2$ and $2$ standard deviations from the mean.

 The set of all irrational numbers is dense in R. Hence, the set of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] for which x or y, or both, are irrational is dense in [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Hence, S is dense in [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The set of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] for which x or y, or both, are rational is countable. Hence, S is the complement of a countable set in [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Hence, S is a Gδ set. Hence, S is a Borel set. Hence, S is measurable. Hence, S has measure 1. Hence, S is not a null set. Hence, S is not a subset of a null set. Hence, S is not a subset of the set of all points (x, y) in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] for which x or y, or both, are rational. Hence,

 Let $a$ be the second term of the arithmetic progression. Then the third term is $a+9-9=a$. If we add 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, we get $a+2$ and $a+20$. These form a geometric progression, so there exists $r$ such that $a+20=r(a+2)$. Hence $a+20=ra+2r$, so $a(r-1)=2r-20$. If $r=1$, then $a=-20$, so the third term of the geometric progression is $a+20=0$. If $r \neq 1$, then $a=(2r-20) / (r-1)$. Then $a+20=(2r-20) / (r-1)+20=(2r-20+20r-20) / (r-1)=(2r+20r-40) / (r-1)=22r / (r-1)$. The smallest possible value for $r$ is 2, so the smallest possible value for the third term of the geometric progression is $22 \cdot 2 / (2-1)=44$. The answer

Multiplying the first equation by $84$ and the second equation by $42$, we obtain $6x+14y=42$ and $3y+7x=42$. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we obtain $-3x-7y=0$, so $x=\frac{-7y}{3}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we obtain $-14y+14y=42$, so $y=\frac{21}{20}$. Then $x=\

 We can think of this problem as distributing 10 distinct balls into 4 identical boxes. We can use the stars and bars method. We have 10 balls and 3 bars. So the number of ways is $\binom{10+3}{3} = \binom{13}{3} = 286$. However, we need to subtract the cases where one of the boxes is empty. We can choose one of the boxes to be empty in 4 ways. Then we have 10 balls and 2 bars, so the number of ways is $\binom{10+2}{2} = \binom{12}{2} = 66$. We can choose two of the boxes to be empty in 6 ways. Then we have 10 balls and 1 bar, so the number of ways is $\binom{10+1}{1} = \binom{11}{1} = 11$. We can choose three of the boxes to be empty in 4 ways. Then we have 10 balls and 0 bars, so the number of ways is $\binom{10+0}{0} = \binom{10}{0} = 1$. Finally, we can choose all four boxes to

Since $f(p) < 0$, we know that $p$ is an upper bound for $r$. We can use the Birge-Vieta method to find a better upper bound for $r$.

We can rewrite this as
\[dy = \frac{xe^x - y}{x} dx.\]
We can rewrite this as
\[\frac{dy}{dx} = e^x - \frac{y}{x}.\]
We can rewrite this as
\[\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x} y = e^x.\]
This is a linear differential equation. We can solve it by multiplying both sides by $x$ to get

We can rewrite this as
\[\frac{d}{dx} (xy) = xe^x.\]
We can integrate both sides to get

We can integrate by parts to get

 Let $a$ be the first term of the sequence, and $n$ be the number of terms. Then the sum of the sequence is $n(2a+n-1)/2=240$. We can rewrite this as $n^2+(2a-1)n-480=0$. Since $n$ is an integer, we can factor $n$ out of the left-hand side to get $n(n+2a-1)=480$. Since $n$ and $n+2a-1$ are both integers, they must be two factors of 480. We can list out the factors of 480: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 80, 96, 120, 160, 240, 480.

However, we need to subtract the cases where one of the boxes is empty. There are 4 ways to choose the empty box. Then we have 13 identical balls and 2 dividers. We can arrange the balls and dividers in $\binom{15}{2} = \binom{15}{13} = \frac{15!}{13!2!} = \frac{15 \cdot 14}{2 \cdot 1} = 105$ ways.

 We can choose 2 letters out of 6 in $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways. Then we have 4 letters left and we can choose 2 out of 4 in $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.

But we have counted each partition twice, so the final answer is $90 / 2 = 45$. The answer is (None).

 We have a linear first-order ODE, so we can solve it using an integrating factor. The ODE is $ty' - 2y = t^5sin(2t) - t^3 + 4t^4$. We divide by $t$ to get $y' - 2y/t = t^4sin(2t) - t^2 + 4t^3$. The integrating factor is $e^{-\int 2/t dt} = e^{-2ln|t|} = e^{ln(1/t^2)} = 1/t^2$. Multiplying both sides by $1/t^2$, we get $(1/t^2)y' - 2/t^3y = sin(2t) - 1/t + 4/t$. Now we integrate both sides to get $(1/t^2)y = -\frac{1}{2}cos(2t) - ln|t| + 4ln|t| + C$. Multiplying both sides by $t^2$, we get $y = -\frac{1}{2}t^2cos(2t) - t^2ln|t| + 4t^2ln

Separating variables, we get

Integrating both sides, we get

\ln |y| - \ln |y-4| = \frac{t^2}{6} + C

Using the initial condition, we get

C = \ln |0.5| - \ln |0.5-4| = \ln |0.5| - \ln |-3.5| = \ln |0.5| + \ln |3.5|

Thus, we have

From the standard normal distribution table, we have $(3 - \mu) / \sigma = 0.25$, so $3 - \mu = 0.25 \sigma$. Similarly, $P(X < 6) = 0.7$ implies that $P(Z < (6 - \mu) / \sigma) = 0.7$, so $(6 - \mu) / \sigma = 0.52$, and $6 - \mu = 0.52 \sigma$.

 The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists a $c\in(a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$. In this case, $f(x)=2\sin x+\sin 4x$, $a=0$, and $b=\pi$. We have $f(0)=2\sin 0+\sin 0=0$ and $f(\pi)=2\sin \pi+\sin 4\pi=0$. Thus, we need to find the number of points $c\in(0,\pi)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. We have $f'(x)=2\cos x+4\cos 4x$. Setting $f'(x)=0$, we get $2\cos x+4\cos 4x=0$. We can rewrite this as $\cos x+2\cos 4x=0$. We can factor out $\cos x$ to get $\cos x(1+2\cos 3x)=0$. Thus, we need to find the number of points $

 The characteristic equation is $r^{2}-r-2=0$, so $r=-1$ or $r=2$. Then the general solution is $y(t)=c_{1} e^{-t}+c_{2} e^{2 t}$. We have $y(0)=\alpha=c_{1}+c_{2}$ and $y^{\prime}(0)=2=-c_{1}+2 c_{2}$. Then $c_{1}=\alpha-c_{2}$ and $2=-\alpha+c_{2}+2 c_{2}=-\alpha+3 c_{2}$. Then $c_{2}=(2+\alpha) / 3$ and $c_{1}=(2-2 \alpha) / 3$. Then $y(t)=((2-2 \alpha) / 3) e^{-t}+((2+\alpha) / 3) e^{2 t}$. We want $y(t) \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$, so $((2+\alpha) / 3) e^{2 t} \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Then $2+\alpha

 We have that $x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 + (c-1)x + 1)$. If $c = 1$, then $x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = (x+1)^3$, so $x+1$ is a zero divisor in $Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1)$, hence $Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1)$ is not a field. If $c = 0$, then $x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = x(x^2 + 1) + 1$, so $x^3 + cx^2 + 1$ is irreducible over $Z_3$, hence $Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1)$ is a field. If $c = -1$, then $x^3 + cx^2 + 1 = x^3 - x^2 + 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + 1) + 1$, so $x-1$ is a zero divisor in $Z_3[x]/

 We have a normal distribution with mean 75,000 and standard deviation 12,000. We want to find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. We first find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles. We have
\[P(X < 100,000) = P\left(Z < \frac{100,000 - 75,000}{12,000}\right) = P(Z < 2) = 0.9772.\]
Now we find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven over 80,000 miles. We have
\[P(X > 80,000) = P\left(Z > \frac{80,000 - 75,000}{12,000}\right) = P(Z > 0.417) = 0.6591.\]
Finally, we find the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles given that it has been driven over 80,000 miles. We have
\[P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000) = \frac{P

 We have to check if $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_1 )$ is a Banach space. We know that $C[0,1]$ is a vector space and $\|\cdot\|_1$ is a norm. We have to check if $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_1 )$ is complete. Let $(f_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_1 )$. Then for all $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $m,n \geq N$ we have $\|f_m - f_n\|_1 < \epsilon$. Then for all $t \in [0,1]$ and for all $m,n \geq N$ we have $|f_m(t) - f_n(t)| \leq \|f_m - f_n\|_1 < \epsilon$. Hence $(f_n(t))$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ and thus convergent.

 The acceleration vector is $\mathbf{a}=-4 \mathbf{j}-32 \mathbf{k}$. The initial velocity is $50 \mathrm{i}+80 \mathrm{k}$. The ball lands when the vertical component of velocity is zero. Let $t$ be the time at which the ball lands. Then $80-32t=0$, so $t=80/32=2.5$. The horizontal component of velocity is $50 \mathrm{i}$, which is constant. The vertical component of velocity is $-32t+80 \mathrm{k}$. At $t=2.5$, the vertical component of velocity is zero. The speed of the ball is $\sqrt{50^2+0^2}=\sqrt{2500}=50$.

 Let $r$ be the number of red balls in the second urn. Then the probability of getting two balls of the same color is
\[P(\text{same color}) = P(\text{red and red}) + P(\text{blue and blue}) = \frac{8}{15} \cdot \frac{r}{r+9} + \frac{7}{15} \cdot \frac{9}{r+9}.\]
We are given that $P(\text{same color}) = \frac{151}{300}$. Hence
\[\frac{8r}{15(r+9)} + \frac{63}{15(r+9)} = \frac{151}{300}.\]
Multiplying both sides by $15(r+9)$, we get
\[8r + 63 = 151r/20 + 1359/20.\]
Multiplying both sides by $20$, we get
\[160r + 1260 = 151r + 1359.\]
Subtracting $151r$ from both sides, we get
\[9r = 99.\]

 Let $r_1, r_2, r_3$ be the roots of the polynomial. Then $r_1 + r_2 = 5$ and $r_1 r_2 r_3 = -15$. We also have $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0$. Then $r_3 = -5$ and $r_1 r_2 (-5) = -15$. Hence $r_1 r_2 = 3$. Then $A = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 5 - 5 = 0$. The answer is (None).

 The characteristic equation is $2r^2 + 3r - 2 = 0$. The roots are $r = 1/2$ and $r = -2$. The general solution is $y = Ae^{r_1 x} + Be^{r_2 x} = Ae^{x/2} + Be^{-2x}$. The initial conditions are $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = -\beta$. We have $y(0) = A + B = 1$ and $y'(0) = A/2 - 2B = -\beta$. Solving the system of equations, we get $A = 2\beta + 2$ and $B = -2\beta + 1$. The solution is $y = (2\beta + 2)e^{x/2} + (-2\beta + 1)e^{-2x}$. The derivative is $y' = (\beta + 1)e^{x/2} + 2(-2\beta + 1)e^{-2x}$. The critical points are $x = -2\ln(2\beta - 1)$ and $x = \in

Then $y^{\prime}(1)=\gamma$ implies $2c_1 - c_2 = \gamma$. Then $c_1 = \gamma + 1$ and $c_2 = 1 - \gamma$. Then $y=(\gamma + 1)x^2 + (1 - \gamma)x^{-1}$. Then $

 We know that $42 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$. By Sylow's theorem, there exists a subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is normal if and only if it is unique. We can show that there is a unique subgroup of order 7 by counting the number of elements of order 7. There are 6 elements of order 7 in each subgroup of order 7. Hence there are at most 6 subgroups of order 7. If there are 6 subgroups of order 7, then there are $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ elements of order 7. But there are 42 elements in total, hence there are at most 6 elements that are not of order 7. But there are 6 elements of order 2, 4 elements of order 3, and 1 element of order 1. Hence there are at least 11 elements that are not of order 7. This is a contradiction, hence there is a unique subgroup of order 7. This subgroup is normal. Now, by Sylow's theorem, there exists a subgroup of order 8. But this subgroup is not normal. For example, consider the group $S_7

 Let $n$ be the number of elements in $X$. Then the number of subsets of $X$ that contain exactly $3$ elements is $\binom{n}{3}$, and the number of subsets of $X$ that contain exactly $2$ elements is $\binom{n}{2}$. We are given that $\binom{n}{3} = \binom{n}{2} + 14$. We can rewrite this as $\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 14$. Multiplying both sides by $12$, we get $n(n-1)(n-2) = 6n(n-1) + 168$. Expanding, we get $n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 6n^2 - 6n + 168$. Rearranging, we get $n^3 - 9n^2 + 8n - 168 = 0$. Factoring, we get $(n-7)(n-8)(n+3) = 0$. Since $n$ is a positive integer, we must have $n = 7$ or $n =

 We refer to Wikipedia articles on accounting for help. The break-even point is the point at which the total revenue equals the total fixed and variable costs. The break-even point in units is calculated by dividing the total fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit. The contribution margin per unit is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit. The contribution margin per unit for DVD players is $200 - $160 = $40. The contribution margin per unit for home entertainment systems is $600 - $460 = $140. The sales mix is 4 DVD players for every 1 home entertainment system. So the weighted average contribution margin per unit is (4 x $40 + $140) / 5 = $56. The break-even point in units is $90000 / $56 = 1607. Since the sales mix is 4 DVD players for every 1 home entertainment system, the number of DVD players to be sold is 4 x 1607 = 6428. The answer is (none of the above).

We can start by assuming that the set is inconsistent and then try to derive a contradiction. If we can derive a contradiction, then the set is inconsistent. If we cannot derive a contradiction, then the set is consistent. Let’s start by assuming that the set is inconsistent. We can then try to derive a contradiction. We can start by using the first proposition: ~N ≡ (O · P). This means that if N is false, then O and P must both be true. We can then use the second proposition: ~O ⊃ Q. This means that if O is false, then Q must be true. We can then use the third proposition: N · ~Q. This means that if N is true, then Q must be false. We can now try to derive a contradiction.

 The volume of the droplet is $V = (4/3) \pi (0.1 cm)^3 = 0.00419 cm^3$. The density of water is about 1 g/cm^3, so the mass of the droplet is about 0.00419 g. The molar mass of water is about 18 g/mol, so the number of moles of water in the droplet is about 0.00419 g / 18 g/mol = 0.000233 mol. The number of atoms in the droplet is then about 2 * 0.000233 mol * 6.022 * 10^23 atoms/mol = 2.79 * 10^22 atoms.

 The angular momentum of the system is conserved. The initial angular momentum is the sum of the angular momenta of the man and the weights. The man's angular momentum is his moment of inertia times his angular velocity, or 4 slug-ft^2 times 1 rev/2 sec = 2 pi rad/sec. The weights' angular momentum is their moment of inertia times their angular velocity. The moment of inertia of a point mass is its mass times its distance from the axis squared, so the moment of inertia of the weights is 2 times 10 lb times 3 ft squared, or 180 slug-ft^2. The weights' angular momentum is then 180 slug-ft^2 times 1 rev/2 sec, or 3 pi rad/sec. The total initial angular momentum is then 2 pi rad/sec + 3 pi rad/sec = 5 pi rad/sec. After the weights are dropped, their moment of inertia is 2 times 10 lb times 6 in squared, or 20 slug-ft^2.

The Coriolis force is directed to the right of the velocity in the Northern Hemisphere, so the lead will land to the East of the direct vertical. The Coriolis force is proportional to the velocity, so we need to find the velocity of the lead when it hits the water. The lead falls a distance of 27 m, so its final velocity is given by $v^2 = 2gh$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height. The final velocity is about 23 m/s.

The atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 amu, and the atomic mass of oxygen is 16 amu, so the molecular mass of water is 18 amu. Therefore, 250 g of water is 250 g / 18 amu/g = 13.9 mol of water. Each mole of water contains 2 moles of hydrogen and 1 mole of oxygen, so 13.9 mol of water contains 27.8 mol of hydrogen and 13.9 mol of oxygen.

The object distance is 30 cm, so 1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di, and di = 60 cm. The magnification is -60/30 = -2, so the image is real, inverted, and has a height of 2*2 = 4 cm. The answer is not among the options.

 The acceleration is given by the change in velocity divided by the time. The change in velocity is $\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{v}_f - \vec{v}_i = (-800 \hat{\mathrm{i}} - 1000 \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. The magnitude of this is $\sqrt{(-800)^2 + (-1000)^2} = 1250 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. The acceleration is then $1250 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s} / 24 \mathrm{s} = 52.08 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$. The acceleration in $g$ units is then $52.08 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2 / 9.8 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2 = 5.31 g$. The answer is not among the options.

 The electric field of a point charge is radial, so the electric field at the point $(3.0,3.0) \mathrm{cm}$ must be in the direction of the vector from the point charge to $(3.0,3.0) \mathrm{cm}$. The electric field at the point $(2.0,0) \mathrm{cm}$ must be in the direction of the vector from the point charge to $(2.0,0) \mathrm{cm}$. The angle between these two vectors is the same as the angle between the electric fields, which is $\tan^{-1}(3.0/4.0)$. The angle between the electric field at $(2.0,0) \mathrm{cm}$ and the $x$-axis is $0^{\circ}$.

 The electrostatic force between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$. When the spheres are connected by a wire, they become one system with a net charge, and the force between them is zero. So the initial charges on the spheres must have been equal and opposite. Let $q$ be the positive charge and $-q$ be the negative charge. Then the initial force between them is $F_1 = k \frac{q(-q)}{r^2} = -k \frac{q^2}{r^2}$. After the wire is removed, the force between them is $F_2 = k \frac{q^2}{r^2}$. We are given that $F_1 = 0.108 \mathrm{~N}$ and $F_2 = 0.0360 \mathrm{~N}$. So $F_1 = -3 F_2$.

 The condition for achromaticity is that the angular dispersion of the crown prism is equal and opposite to the angular dispersion of the flint prism. The angular dispersion of a prism is given by the derivative of the deviation angle with respect to the wavelength. The deviation angle of a prism is given by the Snell's law.

The gas constant R is given by R = \frac{c_p - c_v}{m} where c_p is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, c_v is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, and m is the molar mass of the gas. We are given c_p = 0.238 cal/g - 0K, \gamma = 1.40, and \rho = 0.00129 g/cm^3. We can calculate c_v using the formula c_v = c_p / \gamma = 0.238 / 1.40 = 0.17 cal/g - 0K.

 The total energy released is given by the mass difference between the neutron and the proton plus electron. Since the mass of the proton is much larger than the mass of the electron, the mass difference is approximately the mass of the neutron minus the mass of the proton. The kinetic energy of the proton is given by the momentum of the proton squared divided by twice the mass of the proton. The momentum of the proton is equal to the momentum of the electron, since they are equal and opposite. The momentum of the electron is given by the square root of twice the mass of the electron times the kinetic energy of the electron. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by the total energy released minus the kinetic energy of the proton. So the kinetic energy of the proton is given by the square of the momentum of the electron divided by twice the mass of the proton. Substituting the expressions for the momentum of the electron and the kinetic energy of the electron, we get that the kinetic energy of the proton is given by the square of the square root of twice the mass of the electron times the total energy released minus the kinetic energy of the proton divided by twice the mass of the proton.

In a head-on collision, the relative velocity before the collision is $u_1$, and the relative velocity after the collision is $v_1 - v_2$. The coefficient of restitution is $e = (v_1 - v_2) / u_1$. The loss of kinetic energy is given by $\Delta K = K_1 + K_2 - (K_1' + K_2') = \frac{1}{2}m u_1^2 + 0 - (\frac{1}{2}m v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}2m v_2^2)$. We want to maximize this loss of kinetic energy. We can use the conservation of momentum to write $m u_1 = m v_1 + 2m v_2$. We can then write $v_2 = \frac{u_1 - v_1}{2}$.

The ratio of these forces is F_e / F_g = k * q1 * q2 / (G * m1 * m2) = 2.26 * 10^39. The electron's speed can be found using the centripetal force equation, F = m * v^2 / r, where m is the mass of the electron, v is its speed, and r is the radius of its orbit. The period of the electron's orbit can be found using the equation T = 2 * pi * r / v. Plugging in the given values, we find v = 2.1 * 10^6 m/s and T = 1.64 *

 The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. We can rearrange this to P = nRT/V. We are given two states of the gas, and we can use this equation to find the pressure in the second state. First, we need to find the number of moles of gas in each state. We can do this by dividing the mass of gas by the molar mass of the gas. We are not given the molar mass, but we can still solve the problem. Let's call the molar mass M. Then in the first state, n = 4.90 g / M, and in the second state, n = 6.00 g / M. We can plug these into the ideal gas law, along with the given volumes and temperatures, to get P1 = (4.90 g / M)R(323 K) / 5000 cm^3 and P2 = (6.00 g / M)R(273 K) / 2000 cm^3.

 The power of a lens is given by the lensmaker's equation, which is $P = (n_2 - n_1)(1/R_1 - 1/R_2)$, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the surrounding medium and the lens, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens. In air, $n_1 = 1$ and $n_2 = 1.6$, so $P = 5$ diopters. In water, $n_1 = 1.33$, so $P = (1.6 - 1.33)(1/R_1 - 1/R_2) = 0.27(1/R_1 - 1/R_2)$. Since $P = 5$ diopters in air, we have $1/R_1 - 1/R_2 = 5/(1.6 - 1) = 5/0.6 = 25/3$. Therefore, in water, $P = 0.27(25/3) = 0.83$ diopters

 (a) The power consumed is the energy used divided by the time taken. The energy used is the heat energy gained by the water, which is the specific heat capacity of water (4.2 kJ/kg°C) times the mass of water (2 kg) times the temperature change (80°C). This is 672 kJ. The time taken is 5 minutes, or 300 seconds. So the power is 672 kJ / 300 s = 2.24 kW. (b) The cost of using the kettle six times is six times the energy used divided by the conversion factor for kWh to cents (1 kWh = 2 cents). This is 6 * 672 kJ / (3600 J/kWh) * 2 cents/kWh = 2.24 cents. (c) The resistance of the heating element is the voltage divided by the current. The current is the power divided by the voltage, so the resistance is the voltage squared divided by the power. This is 200 V^2 / 2.24 kW = 17.9 Ohms. (d) The current in the element is the power divided by the voltage, or 2.24 kW / 200 V = 11.2

 The time difference between the two signals is 17.4 × 10^-6 sec. This is the time it takes for the signal to travel the length of the rocket. The speed of light is c = 3 × 10^8 m/s, so the length of the rocket is L = c × Δt = 3 × 10^8 m/s × 17.4 × 10^-6 s = 600 m, which is the same as the length measured at rest. This means that the rocket is moving at a relativistic velocity. The distance of the rocket from the earth is R = c × t = 3 × 10^8 m/s × 200 s = 6 × 10^10 m.

 The reaction is 5B11 + 2He4 → 7N14 + 0n1. The energy released in the reaction is the difference between the initial and final energies. The initial energy is 5.250 MeV. The final energy is 3.260 MeV + 2.139 MeV = 5.399 MeV. So the energy released is 5.399 MeV - 5.250 MeV = 0.149 MeV. This energy is converted from the mass of the reactants to the mass of the products. The mass of the reactants is 5B11 + 2He4 = 11.01280 amu + 2 * 4.00387 amu = 19.02054 amu. The mass of the products is 7N14 + 0n1 = 14.00752 amu + x, where x is the mass of the neutron. The energy released is the difference between the initial and final masses, so 0.149 MeV = (19.02054 amu - 14.00752 amu - x) * 931.5 MeV / amu. Solving for x, we get x

 The skier starts from rest, so his initial kinetic energy is zero. As he skis down the hill, his potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The skier's mass is 90 kg, and the height of the hill is 100 m sin(17°) = 29.4 m. So the skier's initial potential energy is 90 kg * 9.8 m/s² * 29.4 m = 26111 J. As the skier coasts along the level snow, his kinetic energy is converted into heat energy due to friction. The skier's final kinetic energy is zero, so the heat energy generated is equal to the skier's initial kinetic energy. The heat energy generated is equal to the force of friction times the distance over which the force acts. The force of friction is equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction times the normal force, which is equal to the skier's weight times cos(17°). So the heat energy generated is equal to the coefficient of kinetic friction times 90 kg * 9.8 m/s² * cos(17°) times 70 m.

Finally, we need to convert the temperature from \textdegreeC to K. 27\textdegreeC is 300 K. Now we can use the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where n is the number of moles of gas. We can rearrange this to n = PV/RT. We know P, V, R, and T, so we can calculate n. n = 13789852 Pa * 0.056632 m^3 / (8.3145 J/mol*K * 300 K) = 30.4 mol. Now we need to convert this to mass.

The mass of water is 350,000 liters times 1 kg/liter, or 350,000 kg. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so the number of moles of water is 350,000 kg / 18 g/mol, or 19,444,444 moles. The number of water molecules is then 19,444,444 moles times 6.022 x 10^23 molecules/mole, or 1.17 x 10^26 molecules. The number of protons is half this, or 5.85 x 10^25 protons. The half-life of the proton is 10^33 years, so the decay rate is 1 / (10^33 years) = 3.17 x 10^-33 per year. The number of decays per year is then the number of protons times the decay rate,

 The momentum before the collision is $mu_1$ and the momentum after the collision is $mv_1+mv_2$. Since momentum is conserved, we have $mu_1=mv_1+mv_2$. The kinetic energy before the collision is $\frac{1}{2}mu_1^2$ and the kinetic energy after the collision is $\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2$. Since kinetic energy is conserved, we have $\frac{1}{2}mu_1^2=\frac{1}{2}mv_1^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2$. We also know that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, so $\psi=45^{\circ}$. Using trigonometry, we have $v_1=u_1\cos\psi$ and $v_2=u_1\sin\psi$. Substituting these into the momentum and kinetic energy equations, we get $u_1=u_1\cos\psi+u_1\sin\psi$ and $u_1^2=u_1^2\cos^2\

 The equation of the simple harmonic motion is y = 4 sin {(2\pit / 6) t + \alpha}. At t = 0, y = 1, so 1 = 4 sin \alpha. This gives \alpha = π/6 radians. The angular frequency is 2\pit / 6 radians per second. So the phase difference between two positions 2 seconds apart is (2\pit / 6) * 2 = 240 degrees. To find the phase angle corresponding to a displacement of +2, we set y = 2 in the equation of motion, giving 2 = 4 sin {(2\pit / 6) t + \alpha}. This gives {(2\pit / 6) t + \alpha} = π/3 radians. To find the time necessary to reach a displacement of +3 from the initial position, we set y = 3 in the equation of motion, giving 3 = 4 sin {(2\pit / 6) t + \alpha}. This gives {(2\pit / 6) t + \alpha} = arcsin (3/4) radians. Solving for t, we get t = 0.38 seconds. The

 The heat transfer by radiation is proportional to the difference in the fourth power of the temperatures of the two walls, and inversely proportional to the sum of the reflectances of the two walls. So if the reflectance of each wall is reduced from 0.9 to 0.3, the sum of the reflectances is reduced by a factor of 0.9 + 0.9 = 1.8 to 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6, or a factor of 1.8/0.6 = 3. The heat transfer is increased by a factor of 3. The answer is not among the options.

 The Giant Impact Hypothesis is a theory that the Moon formed from debris left over after a massive collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized object called Theia. The Moon and Earth having nearly identical isotopic compositions (A) suggests that they share a common origin. The Moon's orbit not being in the same plane as Earth's equator (B) could be due to the Moon forming from debris in a highly elliptical orbit. The Moon's crust being thicker on the far side than the near side (C) could be due to the Moon's rotation slowing down after the impact. The Moon having a much smaller iron core than the Earth (D) could be due to the Moon forming from the Earth's mantle and crust. The Moon being once entirely molten (E) could be due to the energy released during the impact. The Moon having a lower density than Earth (F) could be due to the Moon forming from the Earth's mantle and crust. The Moon's gravitational pull causing tides on Earth (G) is a consequence of the Moon's existence, not evidence for its origin. The Moon having no atmosphere (H) could be due to the Moon's small size and low gravity. Most rocks on the Moon's surface being older than those on

 The osmotic pressure is given by the van't Hoff equation, $\Pi = MRT$, where $M$ is the molarity of the solution, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. We are given the osmotic pressure, the temperature, and the concentration of the solution, but we need to find the molarity first. The concentration is given in units of mass per volume, but we need it in units of moles per volume. We can find the molarity by dividing the concentration by the molecular weight, but we don't know the molecular weight yet. We can, however, use the density of the solution to find the volume of the solution, and then use the mass of the solution to find the number of moles of solute. The mass of the solution is the concentration times the volume, and the volume is the mass of the solution divided by the density. The number of moles of solute is the mass of the solute divided by the molecular weight. The molarity is then the number of moles of solute divided by the volume. Plugging in the values, we get $M = 0.0312 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}

The moment of inertia of a slender rod is given by $I = mL^2/3$, so the moment of inertia of each blade is $55 \cdot 14^2/3 = 357.75$ lb*ft*sec^2. The initial angular velocity of the blades is $200 \cdot 2 \pi / 60 = 20.94$ rad/s, and the final angular velocity is $280 \cdot 2 \pi / 60 = 29.32$ rad/s.

 The angle of diffraction is given by the equation d sin(θ) = mλ, where d is the distance between the lines of the grating, θ is the angle of diffraction, m is the order of the diffraction, and λ is the wavelength of the light. In our case, we have two adjacent spectra overlapping at an angle of 45°, so the first order diffraction of the longest wavelength light overlaps with the second order diffraction of the shortest wavelength light. This means that d sin(45°) = λ1 and d sin(45°) = 2λ2, where λ1 is the longest wavelength and λ2 is the shortest wavelength. Dividing these two equations, we get λ1 = 2λ2. Plugging in the values given, we get 5.0 × 10^-5 cm = 2 × 7.5 × 10^-5 cm, which is true. Now we can solve for d.

 The angular momentum of a rotating object is given by $L = I \omega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\omega$ is the angular speed. The moment of inertia of a solid sphere is $I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2$, where $M$ is the mass and $R$ is the radius. Since the mass of the star remains constant, the angular momentum remains constant.

 The equilibrium condition is $\Delta G = 0$. We can write $\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$. We can also write $\Delta G = \Delta G^{\circ} + R T \ln \left(\frac{P}{P^{\circ}}\right)$. Since $\Delta G = 0$, we have $\Delta G^{\circ} = -R T \ln \left(\frac{P}{P^{\circ}}\right)$. We can also write $\Delta G^{\circ} = \Delta H^{\circ} - T \Delta S^{\circ}$. So we have $\Delta H^{\circ} - T \Delta S^{\circ} = -R T \ln \left(\frac{P}{P^{\circ}}\right)$. We can solve for $T$.

The ball will rise to a maximum height, then fall back down, so the time in the air is twice the time it takes to reach the maximum height. The acceleration is -g, so the time to reach the maximum height is given by v = v0 - gt, where v0 is the initial velocity, v is the final velocity (0), g is the acceleration due to gravity (32 ft/s^2), and t is the time. Plugging in, we get 0 = v0 - 32t, so v0 = 32t. The time in the air is 10 seconds, so the time to reach the maximum height is 5 seconds. Plugging in, we get v0 = 32(5) = 160 ft/s.

 The buoyant force on the cube is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the cube. The weight of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the fluid displaced times the density of the fluid. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of the cube times the fraction of the cube that is submerged. The weight of the cube is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the cube, so we can set up the following equation: (density of fluid) * (volume of cube) * (fraction of cube submerged) = (mass of cube) * (acceleration due to gravity). Plugging in the values given, we get: (1200 kg/m^3) * (0.5 m)^3 * (fraction of cube submerged) = (100 kg) * (9.8 m/s^2). Solving for the fraction of the cube submerged, we get 5/6.

 The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator is the ratio of the heat absorbed from the cold reservoir to the work done on the refrigerator. The coefficient of performance of a Carnot refrigerator is the ratio of the temperature of the cold reservoir to the difference in temperatures of the two reservoirs. So the coefficient of performance of our refrigerator is one-third of 200/150, or 4/9. The work done on the refrigerator is the heat absorbed divided by the coefficient of performance, or 500/(4/9) = 1125 J. The heat rejected at the high-temperature reservoir is the heat absorbed plus the work done, or 500 + 1125 = 1625 J. The answer is (None of the above).

 The barge sinks when the weight of the ore equals the weight of the water displaced by the barge. The weight of the ore is 80,000 kg times 9.8 m/s^2, or 784,000 N. The weight of the water displaced by the barge is the density of water times the volume of water displaced times 9.8 m/s^2. The volume of water displaced is the mass of the barge divided by the density of water, or 15,000 kg divided by 1000 kg/m^3, or 15 m^3. So the weight of the water displaced is 1000 kg/m^3 times 15 m^3 times 9.8 m/s^2, or 147,000 N. The difference in weight is 784,000 N minus 147,000 N, or 637,000 N. This weight is spread over the area of the dock, so the pressure increase is 637,000 N divided by 6633 m^2, or 96 N/m^2. The height of the water level increase is this pressure divided by the density of water times 9.8 m/s^2, or 96 N/m^2

 The acceleration of the car is given by a = F/m = (F_0 - kt)/m. We can integrate this to find the velocity v(t) = v_0 + \int a dt = \int (F_0 - kt)/m dt = (F_0/m)t - (k/2m)t^2. Since the car starts from rest, v_0 = 0. Plugging in the values, we get v(t) = (200 lb)/(50 slugs)t - (10 lb/s)/(2*50 slugs)t^2 = 4 ft/s^2 t - 0.1 ft/s^3 t^2. At t = 10 s, v = 4 ft/s^2 * 10 s - 0.1 ft/s^3 * 10^2 s^2 = 40 ft/s - 10 ft/s = 30 ft/s. To find the distance covered, we integrate the velocity to get s(t) = \int v dt = \int (4 ft/s^2 t - 0.1 ft/s^3 t^2) dt = 2 ft/s^2 t^2 - (0.1/3) ft/s

 The rocket will lift off when the upward force from the rocket's engines equals the downward force from the rocket's weight. The upward force is given by the rocket equation, $F = v_e \dot{m}$, where $v_e$ is the exhaust velocity and $\dot{m}$ is the rate of fuel consumption. The downward force is given by $mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the rocket and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. We can set these two forces equal to each other and solve for $m$, the mass of the rocket at liftoff. We find that $m = 5.5 \times 10^4 \mathrm{~kg}$. Since the rocket loses mass at a rate of 250 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s}$, it will take 80 seconds to lose the initial 2 $\times 10^4 \mathrm{~kg}$ of fuel. The answer is (None of the above).

What is wrong with the design of this rocket is that it will not be able to lift off the ground. The rocket's engines are not powerful enough to overcome the rocket's weight. The answer is (None of the above).

 The object distance is 20 cm, and the image distance is 40 cm. Using the mirror equation, we can solve for the focal length: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di = 1/20 + 1/40 = 3/40, so f = 40/3 = 13.33 cm. The radius of curvature is twice the focal length, so R = 2f = 26.67 cm. The magnification is the ratio of the image distance to the object distance, so M = -di/do = -40/20 = -2. The answer is (none of the above).

 The refractive power of a lens is given by 1/f, where f is the focal length of the lens. The focal length of a lens is given by the lensmaker's equation, which is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n is the refractive index of the lens material, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens. In this case, the refractive power of the corrective glasses is -4.50 m^-1, and the focal length is -1/4.50 = -0.222 m. The focal length of the contact lens is given by the lensmaker's equation, which is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). Since the contact lens is in contact with the eye, the radii of curvature of the two surfaces of the lens are the same as the radii of curvature of the eye, so the focal length of the contact lens is the same as the focal length of the corrective glasses. Therefore, the refractive power of the contact lens is also -4.50 m^-1. However, since the contact lens is 14 mm closer to the eye

 The degree of dissociation is given by $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{K_p}{P}}$, where $K_p$ is the equilibrium constant and $P$ is the total pressure. We are given that $P = 1.50$ bar. We can calculate $K_p$ using the formula $K_p = e^{-\Delta G_R^{\circ}/RT}$, where $\Delta G_R^{\circ}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. We are given that $\Delta H_R^{\circ}$ is independent of temperature, so we can calculate $\Delta G_R^{\circ}$ using the formula $\Delta G_R^{\circ} = \Delta H_R^{\circ} - T \Delta S_R^{\circ}$. We are not given the values of $\Delta H_R^{\circ}$ and $\Delta S_R^{\circ}$, but we can look them up. For the reaction $\mathrm{N}_2 \mathrm{O}_4(g) \rightleftharpoons 2 \mathrm{NO}_2(g)$, we have $\Delta H_R^{\circ} = 57.2$ kJ/mol and $\Delta S_R^{\circ} =

 The energy of a photon is given by $E = hf = hc/\lambda$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $f$ is the frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength. The threshold wavelength is the wavelength at which the energy of the photon is equal to the work function of the metal. So we can solve for $\lambda$ in each case. For Cs, $\lambda = 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \times \lambda / (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8) = 690 nm$.

 (a) The terminal velocity is the velocity at which the force of gravity equals the force of air resistance. The force of gravity is $-m g$, and the force of air resistance is $-k m v$. So we have $-m g = -k m v$, which gives $v = g / k = 9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 / 0.01 \mathrm{~s}^{-1} = 980 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. (b) The maximum height is given by the initial kinetic energy, which is converted into potential energy. So we have $m v^2 / 2 = m g h$, which gives $h = v^2 / 2 g = (120 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})^2 / 2 \cdot 9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 = 732 \mathrm{~m}$. The answer is (None of the above).

 The initial kinetic energies of the two particles are equal, so $m_1 u_1^2 = m_2 \alpha^2 u_1^2$. This means that $m_1 = m_2 \alpha^2$. The final velocities of the particles are $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$. Momentum conservation gives $m_1 \mathbf{u}_1 + m_2 \alpha \mathbf{u}_1 = m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2$. Since $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, $\mathbf{v}_1 = 0$. Energy conservation gives $m_1 u_1^2 + m_2 \alpha^2 u_1^2 = m_1 v_1^2 + m_2 v_2^2$. Since $m_1$ is at rest after the collision, $v_1 = 0$. Substituting $m_1 = m_2 \alpha^2$ into the momentum equation, we get $\alpha \mathbf{u}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2$. Sub

 The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy is given by $K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.30 kg \cdot (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.24 mJ$. The potential energy is given by $U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant. We can find $k$ by using Hooke's law, $F = -kx$, and Newton's second law, $F = ma$. We have $-kx = m \frac{dv}{dt} = m \frac{dv}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} = m v \frac{dv}{dx}$. Plugging in the values, we get $-k \cdot 0.030 m = 0.30 kg \cdot 0.040 m/s \cdot \frac{0.040 m/s}{0.030 m}$. Solving for $k$, we get $k = 53.33 N/m$. Plugging this back into the potential energy equation, we get $U =

 The acceleration of the ball is -32 ft/s^2, since it is thrown upward. The initial velocity is 80 ft/s, and the initial position is 0 ft. The maximum height is reached when the velocity is 0, so we can use the equation v^2 = v0^2 + 2as to find the maximum height. Plugging in v = 0, v0 = 80, and a = -32, we get s = 100 ft. The time it takes to reach the maximum height is t = v0/a = 80/-32 = 2.5 s. At t = 3.0 s, the ball is falling, so its velocity is negative. We can use the equation v = v0 + at to find the velocity at t = 3.0 s. Plugging in v0 = 80, a = -32, and t = 3.0, we get v = -16 ft/s. The position at t = 3.0 s is s = v0t + (1/2)at^2 = 80(3.0) + (1/2)(-32)(3.0)^2 = 96 ft. The

 The terminal velocity is the velocity at which the force of gravity equals the drag force. So $mg = kv_t^2$, and $v_t = \sqrt{mg/k} = \sqrt{80*9.8/0.27} = 60.3$ m/s. The acceleration of the parachutist is $a = g - kv^2/mg$, and the velocity is $v = \sqrt{g/k} \tanh(\sqrt{gk/m} t)$. The distance traveled is $h = \int v dt = \int \sqrt{g/k} \tanh(\sqrt{gk/m} t) dt = \sqrt{m/gk} \ln(\cosh(\sqrt{gk/m} t))$. We want to find the distance traveled until $v = 0.95 v_t$, which occurs at $t = \sqrt{m/gk} \arctanh(0.95)$. Plugging in the values, we get $h = \sqrt{80/9.8/0.27} \ln(\cosh(\sqrt{9.8*0.27/80} \arctanh(0.95))) = 385

 The electrical force between two charges is given by Coulomb's law, $F_e = k \frac{e^2}{r^2}$, where $k$ is Coulomb's constant, $e$ is the charge, and $r$ is the distance between the charges. The gravitational force between two objects is given by Newton's law of gravity, $F_g = G \frac{m^2}{r^2}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass, and $r$ is the distance between the objects. The ratio of the electrical force to the gravitational force is then $\frac{F_e}{F_g} = \frac{k e^2}{G m^2}$.
