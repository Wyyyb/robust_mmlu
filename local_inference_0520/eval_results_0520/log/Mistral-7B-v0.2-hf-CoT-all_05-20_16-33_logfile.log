 The lac operon is a genetic regulatory system in the bacterium Escherichia coli that controls the production of the enzymes needed to metabolize the sugar lactose. The lac operon is composed of three structural genes, lacZ, lacY, and lacA, which encode the enzymes β-galactosidase, lactose permease, and transacetylase, respectively. The lac operon also contains a promoter, an operator, and a repressor. The lac operon is regulated by the presence of lactose in the environment. When lactose is present, the repressor is inactivated and the operon is transcribed. When lactose is absent, the repressor is active and the operon is not transcribed. The lac operon is an example of a negative feedback loop, in which the presence of the product of the operon (β-galactosidase) inhibits the production of the operon. The lac operon is also an example of a genetic switch, in which the presence of lactose can turn the operon on or off. The lac operon is an example of a genetic

 We would like to compute the amount of NaOH that must be added to the solution to make it red. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to compute the pH of the solution.

 a) The reaction is first order in A and zero order in B. The rate of reaction is equal to $k[A]$. The rate of reaction is equal to the change in concentration of A over time. Therefore, $k[A] = -d[A]/dt$. The negative sign is because the concentration of A is decreasing. We can rearrange this equation to get $d[A]/dt = -k[A]$. We can integrate this equation to get $ln[A] = -kt + C$. We can solve for $C$ by setting $t = 0$ and $[A] = 1$. We get $C = ln(1) = 0$. Therefore, $ln[A] = -kt$. We can take the exponential of both sides to get $[A] = e^{-kt}$. We can substitute in the values for $t$ and $[A]$ to get $e^{-kt} = 0.25$. We can take the natural log of both sides to get $-kt = ln(0.25)$. We can solve for $k$ to get $k = -ln(0.25)/t = -ln(0.

 We are given the pH of the solution, which is 2.1. We are also given the dissociation constant of the acid, which is $8.4 \times 10^{-4}$. We can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for the concentration of the acid. $pH = pK_a + log \frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of the acid. $log \frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = pH - pK_a$. We can then take the antilog of both sides to solve for the concentration of the acid. $frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 10^{pH - pK_a}$. We can then multiply both sides by $[HA]$ to solve for the concentration of the acid. $[A^{-}] = [HA] \cdot 10^{pH - pK_a}$.

Therefore we have $$\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t} = \frac{P}{ \sqrt{M}}$$ where $\Delta m$ is the change in mass, $\Delta t$ is the time, and $P$ and $M$ are as defined above. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $\Delta m$. $$\Delta m = \frac{P \Delta t}{ \sqrt{M}}$$ We can now plug in the values for $P$, $\Delta t$, and $M$. $$\Delta m = \frac{0.735 \mathrm{~Pa} \cdot 1.00 \mathrm{~h}}{ \sqrt{300 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}}}$$ $$\Delta m = 0.024 \mathrm{~g}$

 The mean free path is given by $\lambda = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \rho}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, $d$ is the diameter of the gas molecule, and $\rho$ is the density of the gas. The density of a gas is given by $\rho = \frac{P M}{RT}$, where $P$ is the pressure, $M$ is the molar mass, and $R$ is the gas constant. Therefore we have $\lambda = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \frac{P M}{RT}} = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \frac{M}{R}} \cdot \frac{R}{P}$.

 The de Broglie wavelength is equal to $lambda = h/p$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $p$ is the momentum of the particle. The momentum of the particle is equal to $p = mv$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is the velocity of the particle. The mass of the electron is $9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}$. The velocity of the electron is $1/137$ the speed of light, or $2.998 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m/s}$. Therefore the momentum of the electron is $p = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \cdot 2.998 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m/s} = 2.70 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~kg} \cdot \mathrm{~m/s}$.

 (a) We can use the equation ln[A]/[A_0] = - kt to solve for t. We know that [A] = 10% of [A_0], so [A] = 0.1[A_0]. We also know that k = 0.693/t_1/2, where t_1/2 is the half-life. Therefore, we have ln(0.1) = - kt, or ln(0.1) = - 0.693/t_1/2 t. We can solve for t by dividing both sides by -0.693. We have t = 0.693/0.693/t_1/2 t = 4.00 hours. We can then solve for t by dividing both sides by -0.693. We have t = 0.693/0.693/t_1/2 t = 4.00 hours. We can then solve for t by dividing both sides by -0.693. We have t = 0.69

 The first step is to calculate the pH of the solution before the addition of the acid. We have $K_a = $
rac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 
rac{[H^{+}]^2}{[CH_3COOH]}. The concentration of the acid is 0.5 M, therefore $[CH_3COOH] = 0.5$. The concentration of the conjugate base is equal to the concentration of the salt, which is also 0.5 M. Therefore $[CH_3COO^{-}] = 0.5$. The concentration of the hydrogen ion is equal to the square root of $K_a$ times the concentration of the acid, or $[H^{+}] = sqrt(1.75 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot 0.5) = 1.3 \cdot 10^{-3}$. The pH is therefore equal to $pH = -log(1.3 \cdot 10^{-3}) = 2.88$. The pH of the solution after the addition of the acid is equal to the pH of the solution before the addition of the

 The entropy of a random variable is defined as $H(X)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i})\log_{2}p(x_{i})$, where $p(x_{i})$ is the probability of the event $x_{i}$. Since $X$ is a non-negative integer-valued random variable, it can take values from 0 to infinity. Therefore, the probability of the event $x_{i}$ is $p(x_{i})=1/2^{x_{i}}$. Substituting this into the formula for entropy, we get $H(X)=-\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}1/2^{x_{i}}\log_{2}1/2^{x_{i}}=-\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}1/2^{x_{i}}\log_{2}1/2^{x_{i}}=-\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}1/2^{x_{i}}\log_{2}1/2^{x_{i}}=-\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}1/2^{x_{i}}\log_{2}1/2^{x_{i}}=-\sum_{i

 The weight of a solid shaft is given by πr^2L, where r is the radius and L is the length. The weight of a hollow shaft is given by π(r^2-r_i^2)L, where r_i is the internal radius. The cost is given by the weight times the cost per pound. So we have that the cost of the solid shaft is πr^2L * C, and the cost of the hollow shaft is π(r^2-r_i^2)L * C. The cost of the hollow shaft is 1.2 times the cost of the solid shaft, so we have that π(r^2-r_i^2)L * C = 1.2 * πr^2L * C. Solving for r_i, we get r_i = r * sqrt(1.2/1.1). The internal diameter is 2r_i, so the internal diameter is 2r * sqrt(1.2/1.1). The external diameter is 2r, so the external diameter is 2r. The percentage saving is given by (1.2-

While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, "You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you.

The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, "Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee. Believing that the suspected burglar was about to escape, the security guard pulled out his service revolver and fired a bullet at the burglar.

The solution sprayed into the tank adds $\left(1 / 4\left(1+\frac{1}{2} \sin t\right)\right) 2=1 / 2+\frac{1}{4} \sin t$ ounces of salt per minute. There are always 100 gallons of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ ounces of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ ounces per gallon. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $2(s / 100)=s / 50$ ounces of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=\left(1 / 2+\frac{1}{4} \sin t\right)-\

 The smallest positive root of the equation $tan x + tanh x = 0$ is between 0 and $\pi / 2$. We use the bisection method. Let $a = 0$ and $b = \pi / 2$. Then $f(a) = tan a + tanh a = tan 0 + tanh 0 = 0$ and $f(b) = tan b + tanh b = tan (\pi / 2) + tanh (\pi / 2) = 0$. Then $f(a) f(b) < 0$. We choose $c = (\pi / 2) / 2 = \pi / 4$. Then $f(c) = tan c + tanh c = tan (\pi / 4) + tanh (\pi / 4) = 0$. Then $f(a) f(c) < 0$ and $f(c) f(b) < 0$. We choose $d = (\pi / 2) / 4 = \pi / 8$.

 We have $y(x=0.5) = 2.636, y(x=1) = 3.595, y(x=1.5) = 4.9868$. We can use the following formula to predict the value of $y(x=2)$:
$$
y(x=2)=y(x=1.5)+h\left[y^{\prime}(x=1.5)+(h / 2) y^{\prime \prime}(x=1.5)\right]

 The universal gravitational constant is given by the formula $G = \frac{F}{m_1m_2/r^2}$, where $F$ is the force between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$. The force between the earth and a mass $m$ on the surface of the earth is $F = m\cdot g$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. So we have $G = \frac{mg}{m_e/r_e^2}$, where $m_e$ is the mass of the earth and $r_e$ is the radius of the earth. Substituting in the numbers, we get $G = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2}{5.5 \times 10^3 \text{kg}/\text{m}^3 \times (6.4 \times 10^6 \text{m})^2} = 6.7 \times 10^{-11} \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$.

 The force on the electron is given by $F = qE$, where $q$ is the charge of the electron and $E$ is the electric field. The electric field is given by $E = \sigma / \epsilon_0$, where $\sigma$ is the surface charge density and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The force is thus $F = q \sigma / \epsilon_0$. The acceleration is given by $a = F / m$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron. The distance traveled is given by $d = v_0 t + 1 / 2 a t^2$, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity and $t$ is the time. The time is given by $t = v_0 / a$. Substituting these equations into each other, we get $d = v_0^2 / 2 a \sigma / \epsilon_0$. The initial kinetic energy is given by $K = 1 / 2 m v_0^2$, so we can substitute this into the equation for $d$ to get $d = 2 K / a \sigma / \epsilon_0$.

 The ideal gas law is $PV = nRT$, where $n$ is the number of moles of gas. So if we divide both sides by $V$, we get $P = nRT/V$. Since the number of moles of gas is proportional to the mass of the gas, we can rewrite this as $P = (m/M)RT/V$, where $M$ is the molar mass of the gas. So if we divide both sides by $T$, we get $P = (m/M)R/V$. So if we know the pressure and volume for one set of conditions, and the mass and molar mass for another set of conditions, we can solve for the pressure. In our case, we have $P_1 = (m_1/M)R/V_1$ and $P_2 = (m_2/M)R/V_2$. So we can solve for $P_2$ as $P_2 = (m_2/m_1)P_1(V_1/V_2)$. In our case, $m_2/m_1 = 6.00/4.90 =

The index of refraction is given by $n = \sqrt{\epsilon_r \mu_r}$, where $\epsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity and $\mu_r$ is the relative permeability. The relative permittivity is given by $\epsilon_r = 1 + \chi_e$, where $\chi_e$ is the electric susceptibility. The electric susceptibility is given by $\chi_e = \alpha_e \epsilon_0$, where $\alpha_e$ is the electric polarizability and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

 The angular speed is the angular momentum divided by the moment of inertia. The angular momentum is the mass times the radius times the angular speed, so the angular speed is the mass times the radius times the angular speed divided by the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia is the mass times the radius squared divided by 2, so the angular speed is the mass times the radius times the angular speed divided by the mass times the radius squared divided by 2, or the angular speed divided by the radius. The angular speed is 30 days times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds per day times 2 pi radians per revolution divided by 30 days times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds per day, or 2 pi radians per revolution divided by 30 days, or 2 pi radians per revolution divided by 30 days times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds per day, or 2 pi radians per revolution divided by 30 days times 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds per day times 16 km, or 2 pi radians

The momentum of a photon is thus $6.63 \times 10^{-34} Js/m$ divided by the wavelength of the light. The wavelength of visible light is about $5 \times 10^{-7} m$, so the momentum of a photon is about $1.3 \times 10^{-27} kgm/s$.

 The void ratio is the ratio of the volume of the voids to the volume of the grains. The volume of the grains is the volume of the sample minus the volume of the voids. The volume of the sample is the volume of the grains plus the volume of the voids. So the volume of the grains is $V_{\text {grains }}=V_{\text {sample }}-V_{\text {voids }}$. The density of the grains is the mass of the grains divided by the volume of the grains. The mass of the grains is the mass of the sample minus the mass of the voids. The mass of the voids is the mass of the grains. So the density of the grains is $\rho_{\text {grains }}=\frac{m_{\text {sample }}-m_{\text {voids }}}{V_{\text {sample }}-V_{\text {voids }}}$. The mass of the voids is the mass of the grains, so the mass of the voids is $m_{\text {voids }}=m_{\text {grains }}$. The mass of the grains is the mass of the sample minus the mass of

 (a) The resolution of a grating is given by the formula $\Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{d \sin \theta}$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light, $d$ is the grating spacing, and $\theta$ is the angle of diffraction. In our case, $\lambda = 550$ nm, $d = 600$ lines/mm, and $\theta = 15^\circ$. So the resolution is $\Delta \lambda = \frac{(550 \times 10^{-9})^2}{600 \times 10^{-6} \times \sin 15^\circ} = 0.06 \AA$. (b) The two green lines must be separated by at least $\Delta \lambda = 0.06 \AA$ to be resolved. (c) The resolution of a prism is given by the formula $\Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{d \sin \theta}$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light, $d$ is the prism width, and $\theta$ is the angle of refraction. In our case, $\lambda

 The phase difference between the two emergent beams is given by the difference in the optical path lengths of the two beams. The optical path length is the product of the index of refraction and the physical path length. The physical path length of the ordinary ray is 0.54 mm, while the physical path length of the extraordinary ray is 0.54 mm times the index of refraction of the extraordinary ray, or 0.54 mm times 1.553. The difference in the optical path lengths is 0.54 mm times (1.553 - 1.544), or 0.002 mm. The phase difference is the difference in the optical path lengths divided by the wavelength, or 0.002 mm divided by 5461 \AA, or 0.000000366 mm/ \AA. This is equal to 0.000000366 mm/ \AA times 2 pi, or 0.000000366 mm/ \AA times 2 pi times 10^7 \AA/m, or 0.0

 The Lagrange equation is given by $L = T - V$, where $L$ is the Lagrangian, $T$ is the kinetic energy, and $V$ is the potential energy. In this case, the kinetic energy is given by $T = \frac{1}{2} I \dot{\theta}^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the bar, and the potential energy is given by $V = \frac{1}{2} k \theta^2$. The moment of inertia of a uniform rod is given by $I = \frac{1}{12} m l^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the rod. The mass of the rod is given by $m = W / g$. Substituting these values into the Lagrange equation, we get $L = \frac{1}{2} \frac{W}{g} \frac{l^2}{12} \dot{\theta}^2 - \frac{1}{2} k \theta^2$. The Lagrange equation is given by $L = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \

 The displacement current is given by the maximum charge divided by the capacitance of the ball. The capacitance of a sphere is given by $C = 4\pi\epsilon_0R$, where $R$ is the radius of the sphere. So the displacement current is $10^{-6} C/(4\pi\epsilon_0R) = 10^{-6} C/(4\pi\epsilon_0(0.01 m)) = 10^{-6} C/(4\pi\epsilon_0(0.01 m)) = 10^{-6} C/(4\pi(8.854\times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2)(0.01 m)) = 10^{-6} C/(4\pi(8.854\times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2)(0.01 m)) = 10^{-6} C/(4\pi(8.854\times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2)(0.01 m)) = 10^{-6}

 The drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, so the drag force is initially large and decreases as the velocity decreases. The drag force is also proportional to the mass, so the drag force is larger for a heavier person. The drag force is also proportional to the air density, so the drag force is larger for a person falling in a denser atmosphere. The drag force is also proportional to the cross-sectional area of the person, so the drag force is larger for a person with a larger cross-sectional area. The drag force is also proportional to the velocity of the air, so the drag force is larger for a person falling in a windier atmosphere. The drag force is also proportional to the viscosity of the air, so the drag force is larger for a person falling in a more viscous atmosphere. The drag force is also proportional to the surface area of the person, so the drag force is larger for a person with a larger surface area. The drag force is also proportional to the density of the person, so the drag force is larger for a person with a higher density. The drag force is also proportional to the temperature of the air, so the drag force
